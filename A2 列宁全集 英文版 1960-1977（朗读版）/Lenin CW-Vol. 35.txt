528-29PREFACE Volume 35 consists of letters, telegrams and notes writ-ten by Lenin between February 1912 and December 1922 inclusive.
The documents in this volume reflect Lenin’s activities during the revival of the working-class movement that began in 1910, during the imperialist world war, during the period when the Great October Socialist Revolution was prepared and carried out, and during the first five ears of Soviet power.
The letters written in the years of revolutionary revival— to the editorial board of Pravda, to Y.
M.
Sverdlov and others—show Lenin’s activity in guiding the Bolshevik legal daily newspaper Pravda and the Bolshevik group in the Fourth State Duma, and contain authoritative observa-tions on the problem of nationalities.
A number of letters, to Maxim Gorky, G.
K.
Orjonikidze and others, throw light on Lenin’s efforts to unite the Party on the basis of the decisions of the Prague Conference, and his fight against the anti-Party August bloc, organised by Trotsky.
A large number of letters in this volume reflect Lenin’s struggle against the imperialist war and the treacherous policy of the open social-chauvinists, Kautskians and Trots-kyists, and expose the anti-Party activity of hidden ene-mies of the Party—Pyatakov, Bukharin, Zinoviev and their supporters.
These letters also show what Lenin did to guide the revolutionary work of the Bolshevik organisations in Russia and unite the Left-wing elements of international Social-Democracy on the principles of proletarian inter-nationalism for the fight against social-chauvinism and for transformation of the imperialist war into civil war.
The volume includes a considerable number of letters from Lenin to Inessa Armand, containing most important propositions on Bolshevik theory and tactics in regard to problems of war, peace and revolution.
The Bolshevik attitude to the slogan “defence of the fatherland” receives particular attention.
The letters and telegrams of the years 1918-20 contain directives issued by Lenin on questions of the country’s defence, the Red Army’s military operations and conso-lidation of the Soviet rear.
A number of letters sharply criticise the work of the Revolutionary Military Council.
These letters, and also the telegrams to the Military Councils of various fronts and armies, expose the suspicious activities of the Trots-kyists who had found their way into high military posts and were attempting to frustrate the successes of the Red Army and make more difficult the struggle of the Soviet people against the foreign invaders and the whiteguards.
In the letters covering the years 1921-22 much space is devoted to the strengthening of the Soviet state, econom-ic planning and the electrification of the country.
Many documents of this period deal with the problems of improv-ing the work of the machinery of state—the drive against bureaucracy, the proper selection of personnel, systematic checking of the fulfilment of decisions and drawing the mass of working people into state administration.
Lenin’s correspondence in these years demonstrates his special concern for scholars and writers, for the develop-ment of Soviet culture, science and technology.
This can be seen in his letters about the plan for electrification of the country, the importance of radio inventions, the compilation of a dictionary of contemporary Russian, the work of libraries and schools, and in those which point to the necessity for gathering materials on the history of the Civil War and the Soviet Republic.
The volume contains 172 documents that had not been included in previous editions of the Collected Works (they are marked with an asterisk in the contents list).
Of these 23 appeared in print for the first time in the Fourth Russian Edition.
The letters and telegrams are in chronological order, those sent abroad from Russia being dated in old style, those sent from abroad in new style.
Where there is no date in Lenin’s original, the editors have added it at the end of the docu-ment.
Apart from the reference notes, there is an alphabetical list for identifying the pseudonyms, nicknames and initials used in the text.
QQ 1 TO MAXIM GORKY Dear A.
M.
, We shall shortly send you the resolutions of the Confer-ence.
1 We have finally succeeded—in spite of the liqui-dationist 2 scoundrels—in reviving the Party and its Central Committee.
I hope you will be as glad of this as we are.
Won’t you write a May Day leaflet for us? Or a little leaflet in a similar May Day spirit? Quite a short one, a “heart-warmer”, what do you say? Think of old times, remember 1905, and put down a couple of words, if you have the mind to write.
There are two or three illegal print-ing-presses in Russia, and the Central Committee will re-publish it, probably, in several tens of thousands of copies.
It would be a good thing to get a revolutionary manifesto like the Tales in Zvezda.
3 I am very, very glad that you are helping Zvezda.
We are having a devilish hard job with it—internal and external and financial difficulties are immense—but still we are managing so far.
All the best, Lenin P.
S.
And Sovremennik 4 has had the sense to die, after all! That was a good deed on its part.
Written in February 1 9 1 2 Sent from Paris to Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 5 in Lenin Miscellany III Printed from the original2 TO MAXIM GORKY Dear A.
M.
, I am very glad you have agreed to try and write a May Day leaflet.
I enclose the Conference resolutions.
I have seen Zhivoye Dyelo.
5 A rotten little liquidationist rag with an “approach”.
Liberal propaganda.
They are glad that the police prevent the question of the Party being openly discussed.
Zvezda will continue, either as a weekly or as a kopek daily.
6 You helped Zvezda very, very much with your splen-did Tales, and that made me extremely joyful, so that the joy—if I am to talk straight—outweighed my sadness at your “affair” with the Chernovs and Amfiteatrovs 7 .
.
.
.
Brr! I am glad, I must confess, that they are “going up the spout”.
But as for your having nothing to live on and not being able to get printed anywhere, that’s bad.
You ought to have got rid of that leech Pyatnitsky long ago and appoint-ed an honest agent, an agent pure and simple, to deal with Znaniye 8 (perhaps it’s already too late, I don’t know)!!! If only.
.
.
.
It would have been a gold mine.
.
.
.
I see Rozhkov’s Irkutskoye Slovo 9 very rarely.
The man’s become a liquidator.
And Chuzhak is an old ass, hardened and pretentious.
Yours, Lenin Thank M.

SHKLOVSKY Dear Comrade, I hasten to reply to some of your questions.
A report on the Conference is a necessary and most important thing.
I hope that, once you have taken it on, you will go round all Switzerland, and not only the two cities.
11 “From the Announcement I cannot make out what steps the Conference took to draw in various trends abroad and national organisations.
” These are your words.
But the Announcement stated clearly and precisely that the Vperyod group 12 &Trotsky&Plekhanov 13 were invited, and the nationals three times.
What more was needed? Lunacharsky at Zinoviev’s lecture in Paris had the brass face to say that it was a “Gaunerkniff ”, * because, he said, the invitations were sent out not by the Conference but by delegates who had arrived.
Well, isn’t this Lunacharsky a scoundrel? 23 sessions= 12 days: if the invitations hadn’t been sent out beforehand, the people who were invited would have missed half (letter has to be sent off, secret addresses given, then they have to arrive—just add it all up!).
And from Trotsky’s letter you can see that the invitation was from 7 people= 2 of the total of 14.
I was against the invitation, but the delegates invited the Vperyod group and Trotsky and Plekhanov.
The chairman of the credentials committee was the dele-gate from Kiev (a Menshevik).
Even Trotsky has admitted (under pressure!) that this is a bona fide organisation.
Whom will the worker believe, then? The Kiev organisa-tion or ranters abroad? Don’t believe rumours.
Neither the Plekhanovites nor the Vperyod people, no one left the Conference.
There were * “Swindler’s trick”.
—Ed.
in all two pro-Party Mensheviks.
The one from Kiev behaved with extreme correctness and on the whole went with us.
The one from Ekaterinoslav, behaved with extreme obstructiveness, but even he did not leave the Conference, and only moved “protests” in the spirit of Plekhanov.
The Ekaterinoslav delegate moved his own draft resolu-tion on the constitution of the Conference, in which he fully admitted that everyone had been notified, protested that some had not come, but wanted the Conference to constitute itself as representing Russian organisations.
He remained on this in a minority of one.
Now 12 delegates are in Russia, making reports every-where.
There are already letters about this from St.
Peters-burg, Moscow, Kiev, Samara, Nikolayev and Tiflis.
The work has begun and will continue.
The Bund 14 &the Letts are trying to fix up a conference with the liquidators.
Let them try! It’s deeds that are needed, gentlemen, and not words!! You have been impo-tent (&Trotsky&Vperyodists) since November 26, 1910 15 —when Trotsky proclaimed the calling of a conference— and you will remain impotent.
We have broken with the liquidators, the Party has broken with them.
Let someone try to set up a different R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
with the liquidators! It would be laughable.
The Duma Social-Democratic group is directly neither for us nor for them.
But (1) there were two deputies at our Conference 16 ; (2) Zvezda has nine Social-Democratic deputies on its list of contributors, while the liquidationist Zhivoye Dyelo has four.
There are facts for you! Among the Letts the Bolsheviks have declared war on their Central Committee.
Well, I wish you every success! Greetings to all our friends.
Yours, N.

* I hasten to let you know—so that there should be no misunderstanding and you should not make any mistake in your report— that yesterday there was a meeting in Paris of “Social-Democrats” who were enemies of the Conference.
They all (the Plekhanovites and the Golos group, 17 the Vperyod group and the conciliators, and tutti quanti ** ) adopted a resolution of protest against the Conference, and also something about excluding me from the International Social-ist Bureau 18 (this is from hearsay, because, of course, the Bolsheviks and the supporters of the Conference 19 did not attend the meeting).
Naturally, all this is laughable.
If these gentry proved unable to retain their grip even on the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad (make fun of it in your report, using Plekhanov’s funeral oration in No.
15 of his Dnevnik, Supplement 2! 20 ), now they will be even less able to set up anything.
Well, kind friends, not words but deeds: you boast that you have united.
Do please unite in Nasha Zarya and Zhivoye Dyelo, and above all in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata.
21 Comedians! All the best, and best wishes for success.

SPANDAYAN AND YELENA STASOVA 22 March 28, 1912 Dear Friends, I am terribly upset and disturbed by the complete disor-ganisation of our (and your) relations and contacts.
Truly, it is enough to make one despair! Instead of letters, you send various telegraphically brief exclamations which are quite incomprehensible.
(1) Nothing from Ivanovich.
What is he doing? Where is he? How is he getting on? It’s devilishly necessary to have someone legal in Petersburg or near Petersburg, because things are bad there.
This is a furious and difficult war.
We have neither information nor guidance, nor supervi-sion of the paper.
(2) Not one of the Conference delegates gives us any contacts.
Not one, and not a single contact.
Why, that’s complete collapse! (3) No resolutions from anywhere which are sensible, clear, stating what organisations adopted them, supporting the decisions, confirming that their delegate attended, came back, reported!! Is it really not clear how different such formal resolutions are from letters of an intimate character: “decent”, “jolly good”, “we won”, etc.
? There are no resolutions from Kiev or from Savka’s town.
23 Nikolai has sent in a letter full of joyful exclamations but absolutely senseless.
It is quite unsuitable either for the press or for official use.
Were all the resolutions read out? Were they approved? What is the text of resolutions on theConference? Are they joining forces with the local liquid-ators? Not one (not one!) of these fundamental elementary questions is answered.
Not a single word of communication with that town (most important!) has been transmitted to us.
Is not that collapse? Isn’t that a parody of work? (4) No resolutions from anywhere, not a single one, demanding the money! Simply a disgrace.
(5) Neither from Tiflis nor from Baku (terribly important centres) is there any word of sense about reports having been delivered.
Where are the resolutions? Shame and disgrace! (6) Not a single reprinting from anywhere of the Announce-ment or even part of it, either in print or hectographed! A disgrace.
(7) No precise reply in writing about the platform either.
Will it be published? When? Has it been approved com-pletely? We have to print it in the Central Organ, but have no precise information.
(8) They will have to go round all the organisations again and everywhere get resolutions adopted which are precise, formal, detailed, sensible, clear (a) on representa-tion at the Conference and on its substance, (b) on sup-port for the Central Committee, (c) and against the liqui-dators, specifically against the local ones, and in general, and (d) demanding return of the money.
(9) About the money, things are bad, send us a resolu-tion which gives us the right to bring an action.
The Germans have sent a refusal.
Unless it is taken to court, we shall have a complete breakdown in three or four months.
(10) If you have no financial resources, the budget must immediately be radically reviewed: we have gone beyond all limits, kind are approaching bankruptcy.
(11) In Vorwärts 24 of March 26, there was a furious and malicious article against the Conference, from the editorial board.
Clearly this is Trotsky.
There is a great battle over the Conference—but Russia is silent.
It is no use putting on a bold show and boasting; everyone knows about Vorwärts and the protests, but nothing comes from Russia.
Summing up: this is collapse and disorganisation.
A round of visits and contacts.
Precise correspondence.
Reprinting of the Announcement, even by hectograph.
Otherwise it’s all boasting.
Lenin Pass on the letter to S.
for further transmission.
Greet-ings.

26 As I have already written to you, the Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
condemned the liquidators and various groups abroad 27 which are introducing disorganisation into our Party and represent nothing in Russia.
On the one hand, in Paris at the present time it is groups of this kind that have voted for the above-mentioned resolution.
An old custom has it that all condemned persons have the right to inveigh against their judges for 24 hours.
The persons who have signed the resolution have made excessive use of this right, and perhaps even abused it.
On the other hand, there are groups who were invited to the Conference but refused to take part in it.
Now they are “protesting” and attempting to call another conference, appealing to the gods to witness that they stand for unity.
A very original way to get unity! We shall see whether they will make any headway in Russia.
It is just as difficult to carry out anything real in Russia as it is easy to vote for abusive resolutions in Paris.
And, of course, Paris, Vienna, etc.
, do not possess the right to speak in the name of Russia.
In any case, the persons who signed the Paris resolution are in too much of a hurry when they begin to talk about a “split”.
In order to establish that a split exists, it must be established that there exist at least two Central Commit-tees in Russia.
So far this is not so.
As for Citizen Plekhanov, the C.
C.
informed him more than a month ago of the Conference resolutions.
He has notvouchsafed a reply.
Consequently, at the present time I am quite ignorant of whether Citizen Plekhanov has (and from which C.
C.
) any powers as a member of the International Socialist Bureau.
If you, dear comrade, are luckier than I, i.
e.
, if you get any reply from Citizen Plekhanov, I hope you will be good enough to inform me.
With fraternal greetings, Yours to command, N.

SPANDAYAN AND YELENA STASOVA * Don’t be light-hearted about the campaign of the liqui-dators abroad.
It is a great mistake when people simply dismiss what goes on abroad with a wave of the hand and “send it to hell”.
The liquidators will cause a lot of con-fusion if they call their conference with the Bund&the Cau-casian Regional Committee 28 &the Letts&liquidationist intellectuals.
And they will call it! We must fight stubbornly, seriously and systematically.
There must be a round tour and explanation everywhere of the liquidators’ deception.
Reprint the long article in the last issue of Rabochaya Gaze-ta 29 as a leaflet.
I advise you to print a number of leaflets immediately (all the important resolutions of the Conference are a must).
With leaflets you will win everything.
Be exceptionally careful in setting about Izvestia.
30 The paper will be a great pretext for the police.
And it is more impor-tant than anything else to hold on until the elections.
Remember that there are no replacements.

IN RUSSIA * April 16, 1912 Dear Friends, For God’s sake give us more contacts.
Contacts, contacts, contacts, that’s what we haven’t got.
Without this every-thing is unstable.
Remember that two have already left the scene, there are no replacements for them.
Without contacts everything will fall to pieces after one or two further arrests.
You must without fail set up regional com-mittees (or simply groups of trusted agents), linked up with us, for every region.
Without this everything is shaky.
As regards publication, you should press on with reprinting the entire resolution about the elections, 31 to make it everywhere available in full and among the masses.
As regards the money, it is time to stop being naïve about the Germans.
Trotsky is now in full command there, and carrying on a furious struggle.
You must send us a mandate to take the matter to the courts, otherwise we shall get nothing.
We have already sent the May Day leaf-let everywhere I advise you to publish the appeal to the peasants about the elections as a leaflet (from Rabochaya Gazeta: the peasantry and the elections).

Vorwärts is printing the most brazen lies, as, for example, that all Russia has already declared in favour of the Bundist-Lettish conference.
It’s Trotsky and Co.

Altogether, Trotsky is boss in Vorwärts.
The foreign department is controlled by Hilferding, Trotsky’s friend.
Sent from Paris Published for the first time in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works Printed from a copy written by Nadezhda Krupskaya9 TO THE EDITOR OF Z V E Z D A Dear Colleague, I am sending new material today for the Voter’s Handbook.
This is nearly all, there will he another article or two from here in two days’ time, and then you will get an article on the budget from Tver.
(1) I very much advise you also to reprint from Zvezda No.
34 (December 17, 1911) the article by Frey: “The Role of Worker Electors in the Election Campaign” (it would also be a good thing to reprint his article in No.
36, Decem-ber 31, 1911, about the role of peasant electors, * as well).
Don’t go out of your way to cut them down.
It is better to publish in full a substantial article which will be of value in giving intelligible guidance for the elections.
Don’t go out of your way for cheapness and brevity—better publish something solid.
If, after all, it is absolutely impossible to publish all the articles, be certain to return those you don’t.
(2) Here it is most essential to make arrangements for regular correspondence.
Let your secretary write to me direct here, and not through Arcachon, to avoid any delay.
Give us a better address for letters to you.
(3) You are wrong not to reply to the liquidators.
This is a great mistake.
You can and should reply, without saying a word about the Conference.
You should print a brief reply to every lie of Zhivoye Dyelo: Zhivoye Dyelo in such-and-such a number is lying, as all the liquidators do.
It is essential to reply, otherwise you lose.
* See present edition, Vol.
17, pp.
372-84.
—Ed.
(4) If Plekhanov writes, you should send his articles here in proofs.
Otherwise it becomes a “privilege” for him, which we cannot tolerate.
Be careful.
You will force us to leave if Plekhanov is given the privilege of writing against the Conference when we cannot write in favour of it.
It would be a mean trick to allow him to abuse it when we cannot praise it.
(5) Be sure to send us in a separate packet, wrapped up in Novoye Vremya, 32 these numbers of Zvezda: Nos.
24 and 25 of the summer of 1911, No.
18 (54), No.
19 (55), No.
22 (58), No.
23 (59)—we haven’t got them—and Zhi-voye Dyelo No.
11 and No.

Please send us confiscated issues separately, wrapping them up in newspapers of the Right.
(6) Let us know as soon as possible about the daily paper.
33 What will be the size? What length of article can be sent? (7) Try and buy as cheaply as possible the Verbatim Reports of the Third Duma, especially the sessions of 1911-12.

KNIPOVICH 34 June 6, 1912 Dear Colleague, It is terribly annoying that my first letter to you about the book (thank you very much for sending it) has been lost.
It is an incredible-but with us, it turns out, a pos-sible—fact that a letter of a purely scientific nature can be lost.
I will try and repeat it from memory, because I did not take a copy.
I read your book * with great pleasure, and was very glad to see that you had taken up a serious and large-scale work.
This work will certainly enable you to test, deepen and consolidate your Marxist convictions.
I will note some ideas which came into my mind when reading it.
It seemed to me that here and there, when study-ing the results of “differentiation”, departures from the countryside are overlooked.
I will make clear what I mean by this example, (a) first aspect: out of 100 households 25 have no horse= 25 per cent, or have no sowings; (b) second aspect: of 150 households 36 have no sowings= 24 per cent.
Diminished differentiation, it would seem? But if 30 house-holds or families have left the village for the town, or migrated, etc.
, then in fact proletarisation has increased.
I think this is a typical example.
The statistics always consider the households in existence, remaining “narrowly statistical” and omitting what is sometimes most important.
Then, the author definitely and more than once confines the subject of his research to the tillage aspect.
But in * Reference is to B.

Petersburg, 1912.
—Ed.
his conclusions he imperceptibly extends the theme, speak-ing of the whole of agriculture and sometimes even of the whole economy.
This leads to error, because some aspects of “differentiation”, i.
e.
, of the proletarisation of the peas-ants and the genesis of capital, are, as a consequence, lost (for example, commercial stock-breeding in Yaroslavl Gubernia and other forms of penetration of exchange into agriculture, as it becomes specialised).
Furthermore.
Do not the rows of figures sometimes obscure the types, socio-economic types of farmers (substan-tial bourgeois farmer; middle farmer; semi-proletarian; proletarian)? This danger is very great because of the qualities of statistical material.
The “rows of figures” carry one away.
I would advise the author to take this danger into account: our “socialists of the chair” unquestionably in this way throttle the living Marxist content of data.
They drown the class struggle in rows and rows of figures.
This does not occur with the author, but in the big work he has undertaken he ought particularly to take account of this danger, this “line” of the socialists of the chair, the liberals and the Narodniks.
He should take it into account and trim it down, of course.
Lastly, Maslov 3 5 has appeared as something like a deus ex machina.
Cur? Quomodo? Quibus auxiliis? * After all, his theory is very remote from Marxism.
The Narodniks rightly called him a “critic” (= opportunist).
Perhaps the author took him on trust more by chance? Such were my thoughts when reading your interesting and serious book.
I shake you by the hand, and wish you success in your work.
I take this opportunity to send warm greetings to the whole family, and particularly to the “water-carrying nags” 36—do you remember? Yours, V.

The author reminds you that he is expecting an advance.
It is urgently necessary to reply to him immediately (you can do it through me, but without fail on a separate sheet).

Very little time is left, and the paper should make itself responsible for the whole business.
You should get from the City Council, through any sta-tisticians among your acquaintances (or officially from the editors and the members of the State Duma), all the sta-tistical material (if they don’t exist, then buy Rech 38 for those years and months, or some other paper) about the elections to the First, Second and Third State Duma& Petersburg statistics (housing, population, etc.
).
With such material in your hands, and with an intelligent reporter visit-ing the City Council daily or 2-3 times a week, you can run a good section in the paper about the course of the elections.
Do you send Pravda to the Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung 39 in Vienna? Send it, and send it to us as well by wrapper.
I advise you to reply to Trotsky through the post: “To Trotsky (Vienna).
We shall not reply to disruptive and slanderous letters.
” Trotsky’s dirty campaign against Prav-da is one mass of lies and slander.
The well-known Marxist and follower of Plekhanov, Rothstein (London), has writ-ten to us that he received Trotsky’s slanders and replied to him: I cannot complain of the Petersburg Pravda in any way.
But this intriguer and liquidator goes on lying, right and left.

” Written on July 1 9 , 1 9 1 2 Sent from Cracow to St.
Petersburg First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXV Printed from the original12 TO THE EDITOR OF N E V S K A Y A Z V E Z D A 40 Dear Colleague, I have received your long letter, and I see that you and I must most certainly have it out.
First of all, a detail.
You won’t find correspondents at two kopeks a line.
So long as you have no money, you will have to make do with our articles about affairs abroad.
Now for the main thing.
You complain of monotony.
But this will always be the case if you don’t print polemics— if, in particular, you cut down Kamenev (he writes in a different tone)—if you reduce everything to “positive liquidationism”.
And in addition you will lose all your con-tributors if you don’t print them, and don’t even reply and don’t send back articles (for example, mine: the reply to Blank—important! “Unquenchable Hopes” 41 and a num-ber of others!!).
Just look at Nevsky Golos: it’s more lively.
It is not afraid of polemics.
It attacks.
It boldly makes its point to the bitter end.
By avoiding “painful questions”, Zvezda and Pravda make themselves dry and monotonous, uninteresting, uncombative organs.
A socialist paper must carry on polem-ics: our times are times of desperate confusion, and we can’t do without polemics.
The question is whether they are to be carried on in a lively way, attacking, putting forward questions independently, or only on the defensive, in dry and boring fashion.
For example, the “Supporter of Zvezda” in No.
16 gave a good reply.
Clearly he is a man of principle.
But all the same he did not dissipate the terrible fears aroused every-where (I have a series of letters) by No.
6 of Nevsky Golos.
42 What did happen, after all? Was there a conference? Called by whom? What for? None of this is clear! And until this is cleared up no one wants to work.
Everyone is saying: haven’t I the right to know who I am working for, whom I am helping to get elected to the Duma? Maybe it’s a liquidator? Maybe it’s some muddled Trotskyist concilia-tor? Perhaps I am taking part (indirectly) in drawing up a “common platform”?? Such questions paralyse energy and introduce demoral-isation.
Meanwhile Nevsky Golos is attacking briskly and takes a more challenging line.
You can’t hide differences from the workers (as Pravda is doing): it’s harmful, fatal, ridic-ulous.
You can’t leave it to the adversary, to Nevsky Golos, to open up discussion of differences.
Pravda will perish if it is only a “popular”, “positive” organ, that is certain.
It would certainly be victorious if it were not afraid of polemics, talked straight about the liquidators, became lively through argument, by an article against Axelrod, 43 etc.
Such articles as Axelrod’s attract: all the workers hear about the differences and are attracted to Axelrod’s open explanations, because he says things straight out a hundred times more boldly than we do.
All the workers hear the talk about a united platform, all the leading work-ers know Axelrod’s article 44 —and if you are silent, you have fallen behind! And the paper which falls behind is lost.
A paper must be a step ahead of everyone, and that goes for both Nevskaya Zvezda and for Pravda.
Side by side with the two “positive” little articles, Pravda must provide polemics—Kamenev’s literary note—a feature article ridicul-ing the liquidators—and so forth.
Monotony and lateness are incompatible with the newspaper business.
And Pravda has in addition a special and exceptionally important duty: “whom is it going to lead”—this is what everyone is asking, what everyone is trying to read between the lines.
It would be important to have a meeting (once in four years, beforethe elections)—you can’t carry on the paper without even infrequent meetings with your constant contributors.
Think over this well and quickly, for time won’t bear delay.
Best wishes, Ulyanov Written on July 2 4 , 1 9 1 2 Sent from Cracow to St.
Petersburg First published in 1 9 2 3 in the book Iz epokhi “Zvezdy” i “Pravdy” (1911-14), Part III Printed from the original13 TO THE EDITOR OF P R A V D A Dear Colleague, I have received your letter about the “pressing matter” and, I confess, read it with a sorrowful feeling.
It shows quite clearly that there is between us not enough of the mutual understanding that in a “pressing matter”, as in any serious matter, is most essential.
And the matter is really serious and—I agree with you— pressing (not in the sense of a few days, of course).
In order to get mutual understanding on this, we ought to meet: this would cost four or five days and 11&11&15&10 = 47 rubles all in all.
.
.
.
All that I can do at present to meet your request, I am doing.
I am sending you an article “On the Election Plat-form ” .
45 You will see clearly, I hope, what my views are from this article.
As regards altering it, I must lay down special con-ditions (usually I don’t make any, as you know, relying entirely on a comradely, collective and not pettifogging attitude).
But on this occasion these special conditions are essential for me, because the question is one of vast importance, a radical question of principle.
I can agree only to (1) eliminating the subhead and (2) minimum corrections for the censorship (only!!) in three or four places, correction of individual words, and nothing more at all.
If even then you can’t print it either in Pravda or in Nevskaya Zvezda, return the article, I need it.
To eliminating mention of the liquidators I cannot agree.
The essence of the whole question is that the liquidators are setting a trap: “let’s have an open platform” (while privately the liquidator thinks: I will sign anything inan open platform).
And that is true, the liquidator will sign anything in an open platform!! And it will be not a platform, not a serious affair, but philistine chatter, a list of “reforms”, a competition with the liberals on their own ground, because every liberal (up to and including Trubets-koi) will at present, six or eight weeks before the elec-tions, put his name to anything!! The liberals and the liqui-dators will sign anything, if only they can get elected to the Fourth Duma.
One must grasp the essence of the question, the principle involved, and not be afraid of somewhat “unusual”, “unsuit-able” (for Pravda) expressions, polemics, etc.
The work-ers in their mass will understand very well the spirit of the thing (“no cutting up”)—and that is the whole point.
All will understand why inventing open platforms in Third-of-June Russia, six or eight weeks before the elections, is ridiculous, stupid, philistine, even scoundrelly.
And that is the essence.
Such an article printed as a feature in Pravda, even in small type, will at once take up a position, and kill the adventurism of the inventors of open platforms.
It will kill the demagogy of their “say openly what you believe in”.
Used not Katkov in just the same way to ask: “Say openly that you recognise the autocracy”? Much has devolved on Pravda in the elections, and much will be required of it.
It would be a scandal if Pravda were ridiculed from the left for drawing up open platforms.
Pravda has in practice the position of leader.
That position must be defended honourably.
It should say clearly, calmly and firmly: against the liquidators.
And at once the whole gang of these petty liberals will be killed.
Let them put forward their own list: they won’t dare, because they will be completely disgraced!! I await a speedy reply.
With greetings, Yours, V.
Ulyanov Written earlier than August 1 , 1 9 1 2 Sent from Cracow to St.
Petersburg Published for the first time in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original14 TO THE EDITOR OF P R A V D A Dear Colleague, I have your letter, and the letter from Vitimsky.
I was very glad to get a word from him.
But the contents of his letter gave me great concern.
You write, and as secretary, * evidently, on behalf of the editorial board, that “the editorial board in principle considers my article fully acceptable including the attitude to the liquidators”.
If that is so, why then does Pravda stubbornly and sytematically cut out any mention of the liquidators, both in my articles and in the articles of other colleagues?? Don’t you really know that they already have their candidates? We know this for certain.
We have had official communications about this from a city in the south, ** where there is a deputy from the worker curia.
Undoubtedly the same applies to other places.
The silence of Pravda is more than strange.
You write: “The editorial board considers it an obvious misunderstand-ing” that it is being “suspected of striving to legalise the demands contained in the platform”.
But surely you will agree that this is a fundamental question, one which deter-mines the whole spirit of the publication, and moreover one which is inseparably bound up with the question of the liquidators.
I have not the slightest inclination for “sus-pecting”; you know from experience that I show tremendous patience with your corrections for reasons of censorship as * Reference is to V.
M.
Molotov.
—Ed.
** The city referred to is Kharkov.
—Ed.
well.
But a fundamental question requires a straight answer.
One must not leave a contributor uninformed as to whether the editorial board intends to direct the section of the paper dealing with the elections against the liquidators, naming them clearly and precisely, or not against them.
There is not and cannot be any middle course.
If the article “must be printed anyway” (as the secretary to the editorial board writes), then how am I to understand Vitimsky’s “the angry tone is harmful”? Since when has an angry tone against what is bad, harmful, untrue (and the editorial board is “in principle” in agreement!) harmed a daily newspaper?? On the contrary, colleagues, really and truly on the contrary.
To write without “anger” of what is harmful means to write boringly.
And you yourselves refer, and justly so, to monotony! Furthermore, I have not had any reply for a long time concerning the article about November 9 (the reply of a correspondent).
46 I repeat my request: return what cannot pass the censorship or what you unquestionably reject.
We receive Pravda irregularly (yesterday we didn’t get it at all!!).
We have not seen Zvezda, either No.
14 or No.
17, at all.
A scandal! Can’t you send us the page proofs by wrapper, rather than throw them away? That costs two kopeks.
It would save time.
To send proofs to a contributor is perfectly legitimate.
When leaving at night, the night editor would put the wrapper into a post-box—that would be all.
(But the wrappers often tear, they should be made larger, the same size as the newspapers.
It would be best of all to use long narrow envelopes: in such envelopes— unsealed—press material is more likely to arrive, and the envelopes don’t cost much.
) It is particularly essential to have Zvezda No.

Today is Thursday: two days’ delay!! Finally, please let me know whether it would not be possible to publish in one form or another (like Nevsky Golos, which has more than once printed information about the Social-Democrats abroad) the following news.
The Ger-man Vorstand * has made an appeal to the 11 (sic!) Social-Democratic groups, factions and centres, suggesting a joint conference on the subject of “unity”.
The so-called “Lenin * Party Executive.
—Ed.
trend” has replied with the most categorical refusal: what can be more ridiculous and unworthy than this playing at an agreement abroad with “centres and factions ” which have demonstrated their absolute impotence in Russia? No negotiations with them, no agreements with the liquida-tors—such was the reply of the so-called “Lenin trend”.
Whether anything has come of this arch-stupid idea of Trotsky’s, and whether anything will come of it, is not known.
And so I ask you to reply: can a report describing these “Paris novelties”, and giving an assessment of them, be published, in one form or another, in the newspaper you edit? Do censorship conditions make this possible, or is it quite impossible? 47 (I ask only about the censorship aspect of the case, since in principle—I venture to think on the basis of the previous letter—the editorial board is not in favour of unity with the liquidators, isn’t that so?)

Wl.
Ulijanow Dear A.
M.
, I have received your letter and a letter from the Sibe-rians.
My address now is not Paris, but Cracow—see above.
I haven’t quite understood what party you have decided to expel me from.
From the Socialist-Revolutionary perhaps? No, joking apart, it’s a bad, philistine, bourgeois style you have adopted, to wave us away with a “you’re all squabblers”.
Just have a look at the latest S.
R.
literature —Pochin, Izvestia zagranichnoi oblastnoi organizatsii— compare it with Revolutsionnaya Mysl and with Revolu-tsionnaya Rossiya 48 —and then again with Ropshin, 49 etc.
Remember Vekhi 50 and the polemics (quasi-polemics) con-ducted against it by Milyukov, Gredeskul 51 (who has now discovered that a second revolution in Russia is not necessary), etc.
, etc.
Compare all this as a whole, the sum total of ideological trends from 1908 to 1912 among the S.
R.
s, 52 Trudoviks, 53 Bezzaglavtsi 54 and Cadets, 55 with what existed and exists among the Social-Democrats (somebody, some day—prob-ably a historian—will certainly do this work).
You will see that everyone, literally everyone outside the Social-Democrats was discussing the same questions, literally the very same, on account of which little groups have broken away from our Party in the direction of liquidationism and otzovism.
The bourgeois, the liberals, the S.
R.
s like to shout about “squabbles” among the Social-Democrats, because they themselves do not take “painful questions” seriously, tag along behind others, play the diplomat, and make do with eclecticism.
The difference between the Social-Democrats and all of them is that among the Social-Democrats squab-bles are the externals of a struggle of groups with profound and clear ideological roots, while among them squabbles are externally smoothed over, internally empty, petty, trivial.
Never and not for anything would I exchange the sharp struggle of currents of opinion among the Social-Dem-ocrats for the nicely smoothed emptiness and intellectual poverty of the S.
R.
s and Co.
All the very best.

16 TO THE EDITOR OF P R A V D A Dear Colleague, Kamenev writes to us today that you have informed him that peaceful relations have once again been restored be-tween Plekhanov and yourselves by the elimination of “misunderstandings”.
I would very much ask you to let me know the mean-ing of this dream.
We had every reason to believe that the rejection of the articles by Dnevnitsky 56 and Plekhanov regarding a concession to the liquidators (for it was pre-cisely about this that they were writing, under the screen of “unity”) took place quite deliberately and resolutely.
So what “misunderstandings” could there be in this case? Are there not new misunderstandings in this latest com-munication? The last, or more precisely yesterday’s, editorial in Rech (July 19) is of tremendous importance.
It cannot be doubted that the Cadets have done everything in their power (and beyond it) to “hush up” Zvezda and Pravda.
And now they have come out with it! It is clear that they them-selves have thereby admitted the danger.
They have shown themselves unable to pass it by and hush it up.
They have been driven out of their position of silence.
And Prokopo-vich and Blank in Zaprosy Zhizni 57 echo them still more crudely, stupidly, tearfully.
Now of all times it is essential, in my opinion, to bring intense pressure to bear on Rech, to publish a number of articles against it and inflame the struggle still further.
This is necessary both from the point of view of principle(since only Zvezda and Pravda are carrying on a campaign on behalf of working-class democracy, while both Rech and the Prokopoviches approvingly pat the liquidators on the back), and for practical reasons (since it is just this more lively struggle that must liven up both arguments and talks with the electors and their enrolment in the elec-toral registers).
Could you not find out how many people are registering, by polling districts, streets and professions? It would be extremely important to encourage them by concrete exam-ples, in order to arouse competition between districts, streets and professions.
I hope you’ll be kind enough also to inform Nevskaya Zvezda that I insist on the return of my article replying to Blank (“Petty Artifices”) if it is not printed in No.
18.
I will in that case certainly print it in the journal.
Now that all the liberals&liquidators&non-Party and Co.
have turned against us, it would be criminal for us to keep silent.
The election campaign in Petersburg has begun successful-ly—the leadership has been won by Zvezda and Pravda— what is necessary is not to lose one’s grip on it, and to carry through the fight to a finish.
This is in the interests of the paper itself, quite apart from everything else, which, of course, I do not mention.
I await news of the “positively decided” question.
With greetings, V.
Ulyanov P.
S.
I still await a reply about the articles: “The Re-suits of Six Months’ Work”.

17 TO MAXIM GORKY Dear A.
M.
, If you recognise that “our squabbles are produced by an irreconcilable difference of ideological roots”—that the same applies to the S.
R.
s (that it is the same with the Cadets—Vekhi—this you did not add, but there can be no doubt about it)—that there is being created a reform-ist (apt word!) party—then you cannot say both to the liquidator and to his enemy: “Both of you are squabblers.
” In that case the business of those who have understood the ideological roots of the “squabble”, without taking part in it, is to help the masses to discover the roots, and not to justify the masses for regarding the disputes as “a private matter between the generals”.
We “leaders have not written a single clear book, not a single sensible pamphlet”.
.
.
.
Untrue.
We wrote as best we could.
No less clearly, no less sensibly, than before.
And we have written a lot.
There have been cases when we wrote against people without any “squabbling” (against Vekhi, * against Chernov, 58 against Rozhkov, ** etc.
).

What conference? The one the liquidators are now calling? Why, we ourselves are dissuading them too! Isn’t there some misunderstanding on your part about this? 59 I have read that Amfiteatrov has written, in some Warsaw paper, 6 0 if I am not mistaken, in favour of boycotting the Fourth Duma? Do you happen to have this article? Send it me, I will return it.
Things are warming up in the Baltic Fleet! I had a visit in Paris (this is between ourselves) by a special delegate sent by a meeting of the sailors and Social-Democrats.
What’s lacking is organisation—it’s enough to make one weep!! If you have any officer contacts, you should make every effort to arrange something.
The sailors are in a fighting mood, but they may all perish again in vain.
Your articles in Zaprosy Zhizni were not too good.
It’s a strange journal, by the way—liquidationist-Trudovik-Vekhi.
A “classless reformist” party just about sums it up.

You ask why I am in Austria.
The C.

has organised a Bureau here (between ourselves): the frontier is close by, we make use of it, it’s nearer to Petersburg, we get the papers from there on the third day, it’s become far easier to write to the papers there, co-operation with them goes better.
There is less squabbling here, which is an advan-tage.
There isn’t a good library, which is a disadvantage.
It’s hard without books.

* has arrived.
Many thanks.
Dansky’s manuscript has also arrived.
I am extremely surprised that today, when I had from you both Pravda and a packet of reactionary papers, I did not receive Thursday’s Nevsky Golos.
But I, for a number of important reasons, very much need to have Nevsky Golos directly it appears.
If it does not appear, please don’t be too lazy to send me two words about it at once.
It is extremely important for me to know as soon as possible whether it appeared on Thursday, August 23 (as Nevsky Golos promised on August 17), and, if it did appear, to get a copy.
By the way, I sent you a long time ago a list of issues of Zvezda, Nevskaya Zvezda, Pravda and Zhivoye Dyelo missing from my files.
You still don’t reply whether you can send them.
Yet one mutual friend told me the other day that you have files of Zvezda and Nevskaya Zvezda.
Let me know, please, whether you have * Some words are missing in the original.

kept the list I sent, and whether you can send me the missing issues.
I take advantage of this opportunity to congratu-late Comrade Vitimsky (I hope it will not be difficult for you to pass this letter on to him) on the remarkably fine article in Pravda (No.
98) 61 which I received today.
The subject chosen was extremely topical, and was splendidly worked out in a brief but clear form.
In general it would be useful from time to time to recall, quote and explain in Pravda Shchedrin and other writers of the “old” Narodnik democratic movement.
For the readers of Pravda—for the 25,000—this would be appropriate and interesting, and also it would throw light on present-day questions of work-ing-class democracy from another point of view, and in other words.
What is the circulation of Pravda? Don’t you think it might be useful to publish monthly statistics, even briefly (circulation, name of town and district)? What could be the arguments against publishing them? If there are no special considerations, it seems to me that you should publish.
I almost forgot.
We have had a number of complaints from various places abroad that neither when subscriptions are sent, nor when money is sent for particular issues, does Pravda arrive.
I don’t get it regularly now myself.
This means undoubtedly that something is wrong in the dispatch department.
Please take the most energetic steps you can.
Look yourselves at the letters from abroad about subscriptions, and get the matter cleared up.

Are you quite well again? Write a couple of words: I shall be very grateful.

You ought to support the paper.
We are now “ up to the ears” in the elections.
Absen-teeism is damnably great.
In the worker curia likewise.
But still everywhere Social-Democrats have been elected.
Very much depends on the outcome of the elections for the building up of the Party.

1 7 , January 2 1 , 1 9 2 7 Printed from the original20 TO MAXIM GORKY Dear A.
M.
, The other day I had a letter from the editorial board of Pravda in Petersburg, in which they ask me to write to you that they would be extremely glad of your regular contributions.
“We would like to offer Gorky 25 kopeks a line, but we are afraid of offending him.
” That’s what they write to me.
To my mind, there is nothing at all to be offended at.
Nobody could even dream of your contributions depend-ing on considerations of payment.
In the same way, every-body knows that the workers’ Pravda, which usually pays 2 kopeks a line, and still more frequently pays nothing, cannot attract anyone by its fees.
But there is nothing bad about contributors’ to a workers’ paper receiving regular payment, however small it may be.
In fact, it’s all to the good.
The circulation is now 20-25 thousand.
It’s time it began thinking of a proper arrangement about payment for contributions.
What is bad about everybody working on a workers’ paper beginning to earn a little? And how can there be anything offensive in this proposal? I am sure that the fears of the Petersburg editors of Pravda are quite without foundation, and that you will not treat their proposal otherwise than in comradely fashion.
Write a couple of words, either to them direct at the office, or to me.
Tomorrow is the election of electors in Petersburg (for the worker curia).
The struggle with the liquidators hasdeveloped.
In Moscow and Kharkov the Party people have won.
Have you seen Luch, and do you get it at all? There are people who have fiddled the cards and pretend to be “kind-hearted”! I have seen an advertisement for Krugozor.

Written on October 1 7 , 1 9 1 2 Sent to Capri First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany I Printed from the original21 TO THE EDITOR OF P R A V D A Dear Colleague, I read today in Pravda and in Luch about the result of the elections for the worker curia in Petersburg.
I cannot but express to you my congratulations on the leading article in No.
146.
At a moment of defeat, inflicted not by the Social-Democrats (analysis of the figures clearly shows that it was not Social-Democrats who got the liquidators in), the editorial board at once took the appropriate, firm and dignified tone in pointing out the significance of a protest in principle against “belittling”.
Don’t misunderstand these lines.
Don’t think that they are produced by anything except the desire to share my thoughts, so natural for a constant contributor.
It was a difficult time.
The struggle was hard.
Almost everything possible was done, but demor-alisation had its effect, and the non-Party workers gave their votes to the opportunists.
All the more essential, then, is the strictly principled, insistent and stubborn work of the united whole (the united editorial board, for example, or the general body of contributors, and so forth) to counteract the demoralisation.
It is extremely important not to break off the study of the election results which Pravda began, but to continue it.
To collect and print the votes of all the candidates (you have only 9 out of 13).
To collect and print an enquiry into how the non-Party workers voted, how the Putilov workers voted (7 and 2 liquidators), the Semyannikov workers voted (2 and 1 liquidator), and so on, factory by factory.
Only Pravda can do this important job with success.
Greetings and best wishes.

Petersburg Mandate which by chance, thanks to an opportunity of very speedy delivery, reached us from Petersburg.
Publish this Mandate to the St.
Peters-burg deputy without fail, in a prominent position and in large type.
It is quite intolerable that Luch, distorting the Mandate, is already mentioning it and printing reports about it, while Pravda, whose supporters drew up the Mandate and got it adopted and put it into action, is silent about it.
.
.
.
What does this mean? Can a workers’ news-paper exist if it behaves with such contempt for what in-terests the workers? (Naturally, if certain expressions and phrases are undesirable from the censorship point of view, partial changes are possible, as usually happens in such cases) But not to print such a thing means not only to give ground for hundreds of disputes, in which Pravda will be the guilty party, but also to inflict the greatest possible damage on it as a newspaper, on the circulation and organisation of the paper as an undertaking.
A news-paper, after all, is not just something for the reader to do a bit of reading in and the writer to do a bit of writing in.
A newspaper must itself seek out, itself discover in good time and, at the appropriate moment, print certain material.
A paper must look for and find the contacts it needs.
Yet here suddenly is a Mandate to the St.
Petersburg deputy, coming from the supporters of Pravda, but not printed in Pravda.

First, there was no article about the Basic Con-gress, and secondly, you did not print the greetings to the Congress from Badayev and the others.
68 As regards the first point, we are partly to blame as well, because we did not send an article.
We were busy with extremely urgent and important affairs.
It would not have been at all difficult to write such an article, and the editorial board of Pravda knew that the Congress was opening on Sunday.
But the second omission is entirely the responsibility of Badayev.
It is quite unforgivable that he is not concerned about his paper, that he signs anything that may turn up without at once taking it to his paper.
A workers’ paper in Peters-burg without the co-operation of the workers’ deputy for Petersburg (particularly as he is a Pravda supporter) is a stupid situation.
It is most essential to pay as much attention as possible to this important omission, both on the part of the whole editorial board and on the part of Baturin 69 (to whom, by the way, please pass on this letter, and from whom it would be very pleasant to have a couple of lines), and on the part of the deputy himself.
You asked for the address of Gorky.
Here it is: Signor Massimo Gorki.

Here is the address of a correspondent in Rome; write to him, he will contribute to Pravda: B.
Antonoff, Via le Giulio Cesare, 47.

Please don’t be late.
Why haven’t you replied to the request to print a notice in the paper that the editorial board is looking for Nos.

M.
, It seems a long time since we have had any word from you.
How are you getting on? Are you well? I received today No.
187 of Pravda with the subscrip-tions for 1913.
The paper is having a hard passage: since the summer decline in circulation, the rise has been very slow, and a deficit remains.
They have even temporarily stopped payment to two permanent contributors, which has made our position exceptionally difficult.
We propose to develop intensive agitation among the workers for subscriptions, and to use the money collected to strengthen the paper and expand it, because since the opening of the Duma there has been no room at all for articles.
I hope you too will take part in the agitation for sub-scriptions, in order to help in “rescuing” the paper.
In what form? If you have a tale or something suitable, the announcement of it will make very good agitation.
If not, send them a promise to provide one in the near future, and particularly in 1913.
Finally, a few simple lines, in a letter to the workers from you, about the importance of supporting the workers’ paper actively (by subscriptions, sales, collections), would also be splendid agitation.
Please drop a line about one or the other—direct to the editor of Pravda (2 Yamskaya, St.
Petersburg) or to me here (Ulijanow, 47, Lubomirskiego, Krakau).
Probably there will be no war, and we shall remain here for the time being, “taking advantage” of the desperate hatred of the Poles towards tsarism.
The liquidators are now carrying on an attack against revolutionary strikes! They’ve sunk to that.
There is talk of a strike and demonstration for January 9.
Among the workers’ deputies, for the first time in the three Dumas (2nd, 3rd, 4th), all six deputies from the chief gubernias are on the side of the Party.
Things are difficult, but still the cause is going ahead.
Have you seen the “defence” of Ropshin in Zavety, 70 in the name of “freedom of thought and criticism” (in reply to the letter to the editor from Natanson and Co.
)? That is worse than any liquidationism—renegacy which is mud-dled, cowardly, evasive and nonetheless systematic! We are swimming “against the stream”.
.
.
.
One has now to fight for revolutionary agitation among the masses against very many “would-be revolutionaries”.
.
.
.
Among the mass of the workers there is unquestionably a rev-olutionary mood, but the new democratic intelligentsia (including the workers’ intelligentsia) with a revolutionary ideology is growing up slowly, lagging behind, can’t yet catch up.
Very warm greetings! Write me a couple of words.

M.
, New Year’s greetings to you, too! I wish you all the very best, and above all health! We have Malinovsky, 71 Petrovsky and Badayev staying with us just now.
Yester-day I received your letter and read it out to them.
They were all extraordinarily pleased.
Malinovsky wanted to visit you, but probably the distance will be a barrier.
Ah, if only you could be nearer to us.
.
.
.
If your health permitted, you could transfer to the local Galician health resorts like Zakopane, find a healthy place in the moun-tains, two days nearer to Russia; we could get more fre-quent visits from the workers, once again organise a work-ers’ school 72 : crossing the frontier is not difficult, the price of the journey from Petersburg is 12 rubles, contacts with the workers of Moscow and the South are also pos-sible.
.
.
.
I’ve been really day-dreaming in connection with M.
F.
’s journey.
.
.
.
That was a wonderful idea of hers, really wonderful.
Make sure to drop me a line, when you have a chance, whether she has succeeded in getting her legal papers (probably she will succeed).
Also let me know how Malinovsky can find her in Petersburg or in Moscow.
Through Tikhonov? If we can’t find some cash to expand and strengthen Pravda, it will perish.
The deficit is now 50-60 rubles a day.
We have to increase the circulation, reduce costs, expand the paper.
We have held out for 200 issues—a record.
After all, we are influencing twenty to thirty thousand worker-readers systematically in a Marxist spirit: it is something really big, and we should be dam-nably sorry if the paper went under.
We are discussing with the deputies, from every point of view and in every possible way, how to get Pravda out of its difficulties, but fear that without financial help from outside we won’t succeed.
Malinovsky, Petrovsky and Badayev send you warm greetings and best wishes.
They are good fellows, espe-cially the first.
Really, it is possible to build a workers’ party with such people, though the difficulties are incred-ibly great.
The base at Cracow has proved to be useful: our move to Cracow has fully “paid for itself” (from the point of view of the cause).
The deputies confirm that a revolutionary mood is unquestionably growing among the mass of the workers.
If we now create a good proletarian organisation, without obstacles from the treacherous liqui-dators—the devil knows what victories we can then win when the movement from below develops.
.
.
.
What you write about letters from Russia is remarkably interesting and characteristic.
Menshevik workers say that Russia has outlived Marx!! And this is not the only case.
The liquidators introduce such corruption, such a spirit of treachery, such desertion, as it is difficult to imagine.
And in addition, thousands of intrigues for “uniting” with them: the only way to make a mess of the whole cause, to spoil the building of the Party, which has had a difficult start, is once again to begin the intrigues= “unity” with the liquidators.
Well, the battle isn’t over yet.
.
.
.
I am ready to share with all my heart in your joy at the return of the Vperyod group, if .
.
.
if your supposition is justified that “Machism, god-building 73 and all that nonsense has been dumped for ever”, as you write.
If that is so, if the Vperyod people have understood this or will understand it now, then I warmly join in your delight at their return.
But I underline “if ” because this, so far, is still a hope rather than a fact.
Do you remember, at Capri in the spring of 1908, our “last meeting” with Bog-danov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky 74 ? Do you remember how I said that we should have to part company for two or three years, and how then M.
F.

! 75It has turned out to be four and a half, nearly five years.
And this is not very long, for such a period of the most profound collapse as occurred in 1908-11.
I don’t know whether Bogdanov, Bazarov, Volsky (a semi-anarchist), Lunacharsky, Alexinsky 76 are capable of learning from the painful experience of 1908-11.
Have they understood that Marxism is a more serious and more profound thing than it seemed to them, that one cannot scoff at it, as Alexinsky used to do, or dismiss it as something dead, as the others did? If they have understood this—a thousand greetings to them, and everything personal (inevitably brought in by the sharpness of the struggle) will in one moment be thrown on the scrap-heap.
But if they haven’t understood it, if they haven’t learned anything, then don’t hold it against me: friendship is friendship, but duty is duty.
Against attempts to abuse Marxism or to confuse the policy of the workers’ party we shall fight without sparing our lives.
I am very glad it is through Pravda, which did not direct-ly attack them, that the way has been found for the gradual return of the Vperyod people.
Very glad.
But for the sake of a lasting rapprochement, we must now move towards it slowly and cautiously.
That is what I have written to Pravda too.
And friends of the reunion of the Vperyodists with us must bend their efforts to this also: a careful, tested return of the Vperyodists from Machism, otzovism, 77 god-building can yield great results.
The least carelessness, any “recurrence of the Machist, otzovist, etc.
, disease”, and the struggle will burst out still more violently.

I have not read the new “Philosophy of Living Experience” by Bog-danov, probably the same old Machism in a new dress.

We have excellent connections with Sergei Moiseyev in Paris.
We have known him a long time, and are working together.
He is a real Party man and Bolshevik.
It is with such people that we are building the Party, but there are damnably few of them left.
Once again I wish you the best: I must finish this letter, which has become indecently long.
Good health! Yours, LeninN.

RUBAKIN January 25, 1913 Dear Comrade, In answer to your TO request,MAO I am sending you as brief an “exposé” as possible.
If you had not added that “the 79 history of the polemics” would not be barred from your book, it would have been quite impossible to give an account of Bolshevism.
Moreover, doubt has been aroused in my mind by your sentence: “I shall try to make no changes in your account.
” I must lay down as a condition for it being printed that there are to be no changes whatsoever.
(As to purely censor-ship changes we could, of course, come to a special arrange-ment.
) If it doesn’t suit, please return the sheet.

M.
, Of course, I have nothing against your sending my letter to Tikhonov.
After your account I have become interested in Luna-charsky’s article “Between Fear and Hope”.
Couldn’t you send it to me, if you have a copy? If you want it I shall return it without fail.
The collections for the Moscow paper rejoiced us greatly.
Our trio of deputies from Moscow Region—Malinovsky, Shagov and Samoilov—will set about this.
That has already been agreed.
But care is needed: before consolidating Pravda, we cannot set about a Moscow paper.
We have a plan for organising a Moskovskaya Pravda.
80 Please write to Tikhonov that he should talk only to Badayev and Malinovsky—but he must talk with them.
I was particularly glad of the following words in your letter: “From all the plans and suppositions of the Russian intelligentsia, it is clear beyond any doubt that socialist thought is interlarded with various currents radically hostile to it.
They include mysticism, and metaphysics, and opportunism, and reformism, and relapses into Naro-dism.
All these currents are all the more hostile because they are extremely indefinite and, not having their own platforms, cannot determine themselves with sufficient clarity.
” I underline the words which have particularly delighted me.
That’s just it: “radically hostile”, and all the more so because they are indefinite.
You ask, for example, aboutStepanov (I.
I.
).
81 What did he turn out to be in the era of collapse and vacillation, 1908-11 (yet he was a good fellow, a hard worker, well-read, etc.
)? He wanted to make peace with the Vperyodists.
But then that means that he was wobbling himself.
He wrote letters to me about giving up the democratic revolution in Russia as a bad job, that in our country things would proceed without revolution, on Austrian lines.
I branded him as a liquidator for these philistine ideas.
He was offended.
And then Larin 82 blurted out his ideas in print.
Now Stepanov is demonstratively writing not for us but for Rozhkov’s paper Novaya Sibir at Irkutsk.
83 And do you know what “trend” Rozhkov has discovered? Did you read his article in Nasha Zarya of 1911 and my reply in Zvezda? * And Rozhkov has dug himself in as an arch-opportunist.
And Stepanov? Allah knows.
That’s just it: an “extremely indefinite” and muddled position.
I should never entrust any at all independent department to Stepa-nov now: he himself doesn’t know where he will jump next.
But probably he could be a useful contributor.
He is one of those who haven’t “seen clearly”.
To commission him to “organise” a department means to kill both him and the department for certain.
You write: “It’s time we had our journal, but we haven’t a sufficient number of people who have come properly to terms with each other for this.
” I don’t accept the second part of this sentence.
The journal would oblige a sufficient number of people to come to terms with each other, provided there was a journal, provided there was a nucleus.
A nucleus does exist, but there is no full-size journal for external reasons—no money.
If we had money, I am sure we could manage a full-size journal even now, because in addition to the nucleus of contributors we could, for payment, draw in a lot of people by giving out subjects and allocating jobs.

Party Manifesto” (present edition,So long as we have no money, we must in my opinion not only dream but build upon what we’ve got, in other words, on Prosveshcheniye.
84 Of course, it’s a little fish, but in the first place a big fish, like everything else, grows from a little one.
Secondly, better a little fish than a big cockroach.
It’s time, high time, to begin coming to terms, if we want to have “people who have come to terms” in large numbers.
“It’s time we had our journal.
” The literary nucleus is there.
The correctness of the line has been confirmed by the experience of 12 years (or even 20), and particularly by the experience of the last six years.
We should gather around this nucleus, thereby defining it in greater detail, training it up and expanding.
We had to begin with the illegal one and with Pravda.
But we don’t want to stop at that.
And therefore, once you have said that “it’s time we had our journal”, allow me to call you to account for these words: either to draft out at once a plan of enquiries for money for a full-size journal with such-and-such a programme, such-and-such an editorial board and such-and-such a body of contributors, or to begin on the same plan expanding Prosveshcheniye.
Or more truly, not either—or, but both.
I await your reply.
You probably have already had a letter from Vienna about Prosveshcheniye.
There is a relia-ble hope of consolidating it for 1913 in a smaller form.
You want us to “have our journal”, then let’s push it ahead together.
I haven’t heard anything about the Dashnaks.
But I think it’s a nonsensical rumour.
It’s been started by the govern-ment, which wants to swallow up Turkish Armenia.

SVERDLOV 87 To Comrade Andrei, and if he is not in Petersburg, then to Nos.
3, 6 and others.
88 Dear Friend, I was extremely sorry to hear that you consider that Vasily exaggerates the importance of Dyen.
8 9 In reality the key to the situation at present is precisely Dyen and the way it is run.
Unless we secure a reform and proper management in this field, we shall reach bankruptcy, both material and political.
Dyen is the necessary means of organisation for uniting and lifting up the movement.
Only through this means can now come the necessary influx of people and resources for what you indicate.
Things are bad in Petersburg primarily because Dyen is bad, and we are unable to make, or the board of “editors” there prevents us making, use of Dyen.
At one kopek a month 25,000 will provide 250 rubles.
Remember without fail that there are no other sources at all.
The whole situation in general will now depend on the outcome of the struggle with the liquidators in Petersburg.
That is clear.
And this struggle can be decided only by the proper management of Dyen.
If it is true that Nos.
1 and 3, or 3 and 6, are for caution in reforming Dyen, i.
e.
, for delay in expelling the present editors and office staff, this is very sad.
We repeat: this smells of bankruptcy.
We must seriously come to agreement and set about reforming Dyen.
(1) We need accounts made up to the last kopek.
(2) Has No.
1 had a letter about this? (3) Have you read this letter?(4) You must take the cash (revenue and subscriptions) into your own hands.
(5) Will this be done, and when will it be done? (6) It is essential to put in our own editorial board of Dyen and throw out the present one.
Work is thoroughly bad at present, the boosting of the Bundist liquidators (Zeit) and the non-Social-Democrat Jagiello is an absolute disgrace.
The absence of a campaign for unity from below is stupid and base.
They keep silent about unity on Vasilyevsky Island, about the liquidators’ refusal, they don’t know how to reply to No.
101 of Luch 90 or to their reply: are such people editors? They are not people, but wretched wet-rags and wreckers of the cause.
The use made of Dyen for keeping the class-conscious workers informed and reporting their work (the Peters-burg Committee particularly) is beneath all criticism.
You must put an end to the so-called autonomy of these editorial failures.
You must set about it before all else.
You should install yourself in “sanctuary” with No.
1.
Put in a telephone.
Take the editorial board into your own hands.
Draw in assistants.
You on your own—with some of these people as pure executives—given our work from here, can fully cope with the job.
If this is well organ-ised, there will also be a revival in the work of the Peters-burg Committee, which is ridiculously inept, incapable of saying a word, lets every occasion for a statement go by.
And it ought to be making a statement almost daily in legal form (in the name of “influential workers”, etc.
) and at least once or twice a month illegally.
Once again, the key to the whole situation is Dyen.
Here it is possible to conquer, and then (only then) organise the local work as well.
Otherwise everything will collapse.
You should wait, so far as a Moscow paper is concerned.
But No.
3 and his two colleagues should publish a letter immediately.
Their delay is unforgivable.
They should come out immediately, take up their position, declare that this is our affair—the affair of those three—that they are in charge (otherwise the liquidators will elbow them out).
Much has already been lost, hurry.
So a statement must be made.
Why shouldn’t No.
3, too, be a publisher? What in general is the distribution of duties between Nos.
1, 3, 6 and their immediate friends? Has there been a report? Is there complete agreement? Written on February 9 , 1 9 1 3 Sent from Cracow to St.
Petersburg First published in 1 9 2 3 in the book Iz epokhi “Zvezdy” i “Pravdy” (1911-14), Part III Printed from the typewritten copy found in police records30 TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF P R A V D A Dear Colleagues, I cannot but express my indignation at the printing by the editorial board of Mr.
Bogdanov’s stupid and impudent letter in No.
24, and the senseless note from the editors.
91 It had been precisely and clearly laid down as a condition that such things should not be printed without consul-tation.
The editorial board is mocking us by infringing the conditions.
It is not surprising that for the same reasons no confidence whatever is aroused by the letter of Mikhal-chi, who contradicts himself a hundred times in it.
The enquiry from the Riga workers (No.
24) is dated January 19.
92 There was every possibility both of linking it up with the article on Narodism in No.
17 (January 22) and of sending it here in good time.
I repeat that the edi-torial board is making a mockery of the conditions laid down.
I insistently ask you, after those whom it concerns have read this letter, immediately to pass it on to the pub-lisher of the newspaper, Deputy Badayev.
Yours faithfully, V.

93 A thousand greetings, congratulations and wishes for success.
At long last you have managed to begin the reform.
You cannot imagine to what extent we have been exhausted by working with a sullenly hostile editorial board.
Additional for Nos.
1 and 3 94 : we are surprised that you could take offence or be displeased at the sharp letter with the three-ruble note enclosed.
All the sharpness was directed precisely against those editors whom you happily have begun to throw out.
Sharpness against those who should be thrown out, what is bad about that? Once again we congratulate you on the beginning of the reform.
The letter by No.
3 in Dyen is magnificent, and the other letters too.
Reply whether you have received the draft of the Budget speech.
Send us as much material as possible.
One cannot work without it.
The speech on the Budget could be expand-ed to twice the size, if there were material.
The statements of the numbers 95 are excellent.
I congratulate them with all my heart.

Please send us addresses for literature as soon as possible.

M.
, Now, sir, what’s the meaning of this bad behaviour of yours? You’re overworked, tired, your nerves are out of order.
This is all wrong.
In Capri of all places, and in the winter when there are probably less “visitors”, you ought to have a regular way of life.
You have no one to look after you, is that why you have let yourself slide like this? Honestly, it’s no good.
Pull yourself together and give yourself a stricter régime, really! Falling ill in times like these just isn’t allowed.
Have you begun working at night? Why, when I was in Capri, I was told that it was only with my coming that things had got out of hand, while before me everyone went to bed at the right time.
You must rest and establish a régime, without fail.
I will write to Troyanovsky and his wife about your wish to meet them.
This would be a really good thing.
They are good people.
We haven’t seen much of them at work yet, but everything we have heard up to now speaks in their favour.
They also have money.
They might get into their stride and do a great deal for the journal.
Troyanovskaya is going to Russia soon.
It is a great joy to me, and to all of us, that you are taking up Prosveshcheniye.
I confess that I did have the thought: now as soon as I write about our little journal, A.
M.
will lose his enthusiasm.
I repent, I repent of such thoughts.
Now it really will be splendid if little by little we draw in fiction writers and set Prosveshcheniye going! Excellent! The reader is new, proletarian; we shall make the journal cheap; you will let in only democratic fiction, withoutmoaning, without renegade stuff.
We shall consolidate the workers.
And the workers now are fine.
Our six deputies in the Duma from the worker curia have now begun to work outside the Duma so energetically that it is a joy to see.
This is where people will build up a real workers’ party! We were never able to bring this off in the Third Duma.
Have you seen the letter in Luch (No.
24) from the four deputies about their resignation? 98 A good letter, wasn’t it? And have you seen in Pravda how mildly Alexinsky is writing, and so far not making a row? Wonderful! He sent one “Manifesto” (why he entered Pravda).
They didn’t print it.
And still, so far, he is not making a row.
Won-der-ful! But Bogdanov is making a row: a piece of excep-tional stupidity in Pravda No.
24.
No, we shall never get anywhere with him! I have read his Engineer Mannie.
It’s the same old Machism= idealism, so concealed that neither the workers nor the stupid editors of Pravda understood it.
No, this Machist is as hopeless as Lunacharsky (thanks for his article).
If only Lunacharsky could be separated from Bogdanov in aesthetics, as Alexinsky has begun to draw apart from him in politics .
.
.
if only.
.
.
.
As regards the theory of matter and its structure, I am fully in agreement with you that one should write about it, and that it is a good remedy against “the poison which the shapeless Russian soul is sucking”.
Only you are wrong to call this poison “metaphysics ” .
It ought to be called idealism and agnosticism.
For the Machists call materialism metaphysics! And it so happens that a host of the most prominent present-day physicists, on the occasion of the “wonders” of radium, electrons, etc.
, are smuggling in the God business—both the crudest and the most subtle—in the shape of philosophical idealism.
As regards nationalism I am fully in agreement with you that we ought to take this up more seriously.
We have a marvellous Georgian who has sat down to write a big arti-cle for Prosveshcheniye, for which he has collected all the Austrian and other materials.
99 We shall go at this hard.
But that our resolutions (I am sending them in printed form) “are formalities, bureaucracy”, there your abuse is off target.
No.
It’s not a formality.
In Russia and in the Cau-casus the Georgian & Armenian & Tartar & Russian Social-Democrats have worked together, in a single Social-Demo-cratic organisation for more than ten years.
This is not a phrase, but the proletarian solution of the problem of nationalities.
The only solution.
So it was in Riga too: Russians & Letts & Lithuanians.
Only the separatists—the Bund—used to stand aloof.
The same at Vilna.
There are two good Social-Democratic pamphlets on the nationalities problem: Strasser and Pannekoek.
Would you like me to send them to you? Will you find anyone to translate them from the German for you? No, the disgusting situation that exists in Austria won’t happen here.
We won’t allow it! And there are more of our Great Russians here.
With the workers on our side we won’t let in any of the “Austrian spirit”.
As regards Pyatnitsky, 100 I am for prosecution.
There is no need to stand on ceremony.
Sentimentalism would be unforgivable.
Socialists are not at all against use of the state court.
We are for making use of legality.
Marx and Bebel made use of the state court even against their socialist opponents.
One must know how to do it, but it must be done.
Pyatnitsky must be prosecuted, and no nonsense.
If you hear reproaches against you for this—spit in the mugs of those who make them.
It is the hypocrites who will reproach you.
To give way to Pyatnitsky, to let him off for fear of going to court, would be unforgivable.
Well, I have chattered more than enough.
Write and tell me about your health.
Yours, Lenin P.

He is now at Narym.

234 of Pravda I see clearly that these articles will not be suit-able.
Therefore please pass them over without delay to Prosveshcheniye, to which I am sending the final section.

Clear-ly the dispatch department is working carelessly.
I ear-nestly request you to take steps to see that they display greater care with the daily post.
I receive no new books at all.
Steps must be taken (a) to get them from the publishers on a deposit account, (b) to get the Puma and official publications through the deputies.

without them.
I particularly need the issue of Russkaya Molva where they wrote about Luch and explained that the Mensheviks are against underground work.
March 1 (14) will be the 30th anniversary of the death of Marx.
You ought to publish a supplement for two or three kopeks, four pages in Pravda format with a big por-trait of Marx and a number of small articles.
103 There should also he detailed advertisements both for Pravda and Prosveshcheniye.
Probably it would pay for itself with a circulation of 25-30 thousand, and make a profit.
If you agree, cable me: “Draw up” (we shall then sit down to write), then, in addition, send a more detailed reply.
Reply please, two or three times a week in a few lines, about what articles you have received and which will be printed.
In my opinion you were quite right to publish Dnevnitsky in full, as a first step.
But for the future it would be better to hold up such long (and bad) articles, and to begin cor-respondence about passing them over to Prosveshcheniye.
Yours, I.

SAVELYEV For Vetrov Urgent Dear Colleague, It is extremely sad that our correspondence is still not properly organised, that I still have no special address for you personally, that you don’t reply to my questions for so long.
(1) I wrote to you a very, very long time ago that Zvezda still had, in addition to the article “Debates in Britain on Liberal Labour Policy”, the articles “Two Utopias” * and a criticism of the boycott policy (against Amfiteatrov, I don’t remember the title 104 ).
I repeat what I asked: get hold of them and send them to me.
I hope to make use of them.
(2) At Pravda there are also a number of articles which have not been used there.
I very much want you to find them and make them into notes of a publicist signed, say, T.

) II.

Good news from Petersburg, Moscow Region and the South.
The workers’ illegal organisation is growing and taking shape.
A reform of Pravda has begun.
Troyanovsky is starting something like an intrigue on account of Koba’s article for Prosveshcheniye: “The Prob-lem of Nationalities and Social-Democracy”.
He wants it to be stated that the article is for discussion, because Galina is for cultural-national autonomy!! Of course we are absolutely against.
The article is a very good one.
It’s a burning question, and we shall not give up one iota of our attitude in principle against the Bundist, rabble.
It may “blow over”, but .

You should try to get back—having first found out, of course, whether they won’t play you a dirty trick on account of the “school”,107 etc.
Probably they won’t be able to prosecute you for this.
I hope you don’t take the view that one mustn’t “accept” an amnesty? This would he wrong.
A revolutionary, as things are today, will do more from inside Russia, and our deputies even sign “the solemn oath”.
But you don’t have to sign anything, only to make use of the amnesty.
Drop me a line about your opinion and your plans.
Perhaps you will call here if you do move— after all, it’s on your way! And for a revolutionary writer to have the possibility of roaming around Russia (the new Russia) means that he is afterwards able to hit a hundred times harder at the Romanovs and Co.

Thanks.
I passed it on today to Malinovsky, who is here; .

It’s strange, very strange indeed, about Dan! He lives quite freely, goes to the group, is the editor of Luch, etc.
!! The secret police are playing some big game here! There are heavy arrests at home.
Koba has been arrested.
We have discussed with Malinovsky what measures to take.
The circulation of Pravda is 30-32 thousand on week-days and 40-42 thousand on holidays.
There is a general cry that we haven’t the people.
The liquidators have a mass of intellectuals, while all ours get arrested.
It’s been decided “in principle” to abolish the extra sheets and to publish weekly supplements to Pravda, for an extra payment, of 4-8-12 pages (in place of Zvezda); it would be a good thing if successful—but the lack of people is a hindrance.
The Six got on very well together, but complain that it’s hard going.
.
.
.
All the “intelligentsia” are with the liquidators.
The mass of the workers are with us (40,000 Pravda, against 12,000 Luch) but the workers are producing their own intelligentsia with the greatest difficulty.
Slowly and with difficulty.
Party affairs in Russia in general are obviously improv-ing.
Workers’ circles, groups and organisations are obviously developing everywhere and growing stronger.

There is an undoubted revival in the Social-Democratic movement.
Once again people have begun to give (a little) money.
News! There are signs of a revival of revolutionary organisations in the forces.
But the tempo of the movement is different somehow, new in some way.

What a wobbler he is! Helped Mayevsky 108 (after January 1912)—then abandoned him (August 1912)—was mercilessly attacked by him—now attacks him in turn!! Kiselyov has sent me a long letter, reproaching me for keeping down the pro-Party Menshe-viks, of whom I am supposed to be unwarrantedly demand-ing that they should be “Leninists”.
The man’s a crank! But Gr—y thinks this is a “move” by Plekhanov.

Something new in the history of intrigue: K.
Radek has put out a pamphlet Meine Abrechnung, against Tyszka, gave him a terrific lambasting.
They have promised to send you a copy too.
I have read Rosa’s new book Die Akkumulation des Ka-pitals.
She has got into a shocking muddle.
She has distorted Marx.
I am very glad that Pannekoek and Eckstein and O.
Bauer have all with one accord condemned her, and said against her what I said in 1890 against the Narodniks.

109 Koba had time to write a big article on the nationalities problem (for three issues of Prosveshcheniye).
Good! We must fight for the truth against the separatists and oppor-tunists of the Bund and among the liquidators.
There is a certain moving of the waters towards Russia: there are more leaving foreign parts to work at home than before.
Trotsky, they say, is offended with Luch.
But I must close.
Warm regards from Malinovsky and us all.
All the best.

Dear Comrades, Many thanks for your detailed letter and very valuable information.
Write more often, and give us contacts with the districts.
It is very important that the liquidators are giving a “hostile” reception to the rapprochement of the pro-Party Mensheviks with the Party.
A resolution about this ought to be adopted in the districts.
This fact proves for the 1,000th time that the liquidators have finally become a non-Party and anti-Party element, that unity is possible only against them (against Luch) and by no means with them.
You are quite right, in my belief, in attributing great impor-tance to this fact.
One can’t in any way talk about unity with the liquidators: one cannot unite the Party with the destroyers of the Party.
The resolution of the February Conference of 1913 about unity from below, it seems to me, should be hectographed (if there are not enough copies), adding the resolution against Luch with the precise list of the five points.
110 Furthermore, I fully share your opinion about the impor-tance of a campaign against the Seven, 111 and of the workers displaying initiative in this respect.
The Seven are waver-ing and near-Party, but to a very little extent Party people.
One can enter into agreements with them within the Duma, in order to direct them and drag them after oneself, but it would be a crime to gloss over their liquidationism, theirlack of character and principle.
We must support and develop the campaign against the Seven.
Now that the liq-uidators’ Luch is expanding (obviously on liberals’ money, because its deficit is 1,000 rubles a month, and its circu-lation is only 12,000) we must strengthen tenfold the cam-paign to support the six workers’ deputies, to increase Pravda’s readership, to extend Pravda.
We must take the struggle for Pravda direct into the factories, pressing them to subscribe for more copies, winning away every factory from Luch, so that there is a competition between the facto-ries for the largest number of subscribers to Pravda.
A vic-tory of Party principles is a victory for Pravda and vice versa.
We should start this kind of campaign: to increase the circulation of Pravda from 30,000 to 50,000-60,000, and the number of subscribers from 5,000 to 20,000, and proceed unfalteringly in this direction.
Then we shall extend and improve Pravda.
Your remarks about the lack of intellectuals are very true.
And we won’t have them.
Pravda and the illegal publi-cations will replace them.
You should publish at least hectographed resolutions and leaflets until more is technical-ly possible.
There should be a weekly publication of 30-60 copies of hectographed resolutions of the Petersburg Com-mittee by way of directives.
We could always come to an agreement by correspondence about these resolutions.
Think this over.
It will strengthen the illegal work, reduce the number of victims, make the propaganda more general, etc.
The resolution of the Petersburg Committee for the Six against the Seven is excellent.
1 1 2 Haven’t you even hecto-graphed it? This is absolutely essential.
Now this is just the kind of campaign that is necessary.
We shall try to send you articles for Izvestia.
1 1 3 Let us know the dates.
Tell us what the size will be, and what the length of the articles should be.

M.
, How do you stand about a little article or a story for the May issue of Prosveshcheniye? They write to me from there that they could publish 10-15 thousand (that’s how we are marching ahead!), if there were something from you.
Drop me a line whether there will be.
1 1 4 Then Pravda re-prints it, and we get 40,000 readers.
Yes .

the affairs of Prosveshcheniye could begin to prosper; otherwise there does not exist, devil take it, a single consistent journal for the workers, for the Social-Democrats, for revolutionary democracy; nothing but rotten sour-pusses of one kind or another.
How is your health? Have you rested, and will you be taking a rest in the summer? It is essential, my word on it, that you should have a good rest! Things are not too well with me.
The wife is down with goitre.
Nerves! My nerves are also playing me up a little.
We are spending the summer in the village of Poronin, near Zakopane.
(My address is: Herrn Wl.
Ulianow, Po-ronin, Galizien, Austria.
) It’s a good place, and healthy.
Height about.
700 metres.
Suppose you took it into your head to pay us a visit? There will be interesting workers from Russia.
Zakopane (seven versts from us) is a well-known health resort.
Have you seen Demyan Bedny’s Fables? 1 1 5 I will send them if you haven’t.
If you have, write and say what you think of them.
Do you get Pravda and Luch regularly? Our cause is going ahead—in spite of everything—and the workers’ party is being built up as a revolutionary Social-Democratic party, against the liberal renegades, the liquidators.
We shall have cause to celebrate one day.
We are rejoicing just now at the victory of the workers in Petersburg over the liquida-tors when the Board of the new Metalworkers’ Union 116 was elected.
And “your” Lunacharsky is a fine one!! Oh, what a fine fellow! Maeterlinck, he says, has “scientific mysticism”.

Or Lunacharsky and Bogdanov are perhaps no longer yours? Joking apart.
Keep well.

How did you find the jubilee number of Pravda? 117 Written not earlier than May 9 -1 0 , 1 9 1 3 Sent to Capri First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany I Printed from the original40 TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF P R A V D A Dear Colleagues, Today at last I have received the file of Pravda for the last few days or, more precisely, for the last week.
My best thanks and best congratulations on your success: in my opinion the paper has now undoubtedly found its feet.
The improvement is a tremendous one and a serious one, and, let us hope, firm and for good.
The length of Plekhanov’s articles and the abundance of anti-liquidationism (about which one of the workers’ deputies writes to me) are now questions of detail; it won’t be difficult to correct mat-ters in this respect, now that the paper has taken a firm stand, and I think that the workers on the spot will see at once how to make the necessary correction.
We have also received the detailed letter of a member of the staff (who unfortunately has not the pleasant “deputy” quality), and we were very glad of it, congratulating him on every kind of success.
It seems as though now (and only now, after the St—v * adventure) the period of wavering has ended .
.
.
touch wood! .
.
.
I don’t advise you to present Plekhanov with ultimatums: it is too early, it may do harm!! If you do write to him, write as kindly and mildly as possible.
He is valuable now because he is fighting the enemies of the working-class movement.
As regards Dernyan Bedny, I continue to be for.
Don’t find fault, friends, with human failings! Talent is rare.
It should he systematically and carefully supported.
It will be a sin on your conscience, a great sin (a hundred * Who this refers to has not been established.

times bigger than various personal “sins”, if such occur.
.
.
) against the democratic working-class movement, if you don’t draw in this talented contributor and don’t help him.
The disputes were petty, the cause is a serious one.
Think over this! As regards expansion, I have recently written in detail to one of the Prosveshcheniye people; I hope you also have seen the letter.
I, too, am in favour of financial caution: to provide the same six pages (the present extra sheets) in another form, with a different sauce and title and content: 4 pages of Sunday supplement for the advanced workers&2 pages of a “workers’ kopek” for 1 kopek, for the masses, to win a hundred thousand readers, with an especially popular content.
You shouldn’t imitate Luch but go your own road, the proletarian road: 4 pages for the advanced workers and 2 pages (and later even 4) for the masses, for a long and stubborn battle for 100,000 readers.
We must go wide and deep, into the masses, and not follow intellectual patterns like Luch.
Once again greetings, congratulations and best wishes.
Yours, V.
I.
Another special greeting to Vitimsky: his article about the workers ’ press and workers’ democracy against the liberals 118 was very successful !! And the Bogdanov “Ideol-ogy” is certain to be heresy: I promise you that I will prove this exactly!! 119 Marxists are glad of an increase in circulation when it is increased by Marxist articles, and not by articles against Marxism.
We want a principled paper—all the contributors and readers of Pravda want it—a Marxist, not Machist paper? Isn’t that so? P.

Written not earlier than May 2 5 , 1 9 1 3 Sent to St.
Petersburg First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXV Printed from the original41 TO THE BOLSHEVIK DEPUTIES IN THE FOURTH STATE DUMA Dear Friends, In our opinion you made a mistake in tying yourselves up with Fyodor.
1 2 0 Probably nothing but squabbles will come of it.
You should have published your own report.
1 2 1 But now we have to start from what has already been done.
In the present situation it is essential to insist above all on complete equality, and at the very outset to move a formal resolution, approximately in this form: “The co-opera-tive 1 2 2 resolves that in drawing up the report no majority decision of one wing over another is allowed, and both wings (the Six and the Seven) enjoy complete equality in all respects, i.
e.
, the commission is set up on a parity basis, and disputed passages are edited by agreement, and not by a majority decision.
If speeches of the deputies are printed at the end of the report, the selection of the speeches also is to be by agreement.
” This resolution is essen-tial.
Otherwise they will set up a commission on the basis of equality, and then the co-operative, by a majority of one, will endorse what the liquidator proposes.
If Feodora rejects such a resolution, we recommend you officially to declare that, in view of their unwillingness to agree to equality, you reserve complete freedom of action.
Even so, you can still put forward your own candidate.
We append the first rough draft of the theses: 1) The election campaign.
The circumstances in which it takes place.
Its results for the Social-Democrats.
The platform of the Social-Democrats: the 8-hour day, confisca-tion of the land, complete democratisation.
2) The composition of the Social-Democratic group.
How it was set up.
The Jagiello case.
123 (Exposition of the points of view of the Six and the Seven.
Indication of protests made.
) 3) The political platform of the group and its first speeches.
The declaration.
Indicate that the Six reject cultu-ral-national autonomy.
Indicate that wide sections of the workers have approved precisely .
.
.
the watchwords in the declaration.
An outline of the political position of the Social-Democrats.
The main watchwords are still: the 8-hour day, trans-fer of the land, complete democratisation.
4) Questions put down by the group.
5) The group and the Budget.
6) The bourgeois groups in the Duma and sharp criticism of them and of the liberals (the speeches by Maklakov, the Octobrists, 124 the Black Hundreds 125).
7) The workers and the group.
Their instructions, appeals, reactions, material for questions, mutual aid in cash, etc.
8) Immunity of the deputies (the case of Petrovsky 126 ).
Internal differences: each side puts forward its own point of view, with an equal number of pages to each.
Statements made by each side to the press are reprinted.
A list of work-ers’ resolutions, as many as there are.
The supplement.
Most important tasks.
We await your news.

PLEKHANOV Dear Georgy Valentinovich, At the request of the six Social-Democratic deputies I invite you to come for a few weeks to Zakopane in the summer to deliver lectures on such questions of Marxism and the Social-Democratic movement as you may select.
We have heard today from Petersburg that it is also possible that four deputies may come who support the liquidators or who are wavering (Buryanov, Tulyakov, Khaustov and maybe even Mankov).
As Mensheviks they naturally attribute particular importance to the question of your participation.
On our part, we should think it very useful that Party people of various views should take part in an enterprise which seems to us extremely important for strengthen-ing connections with the workers and reinforcing Party work.
In view of the conspirative nature of the case, we have decided not to tell a single group abroad about the plan to organise these lectures—all the more so because the deputies would probably be in peril of particularly severe penalties.
Poronin, where it is proposed to hold the lectures, is seven kilometres by rail from Zakopane—one of the best mountain health resorts in Galicia.
As to the financialside (travelling expenses), we can come to a special arrange-ment by correspondence, if required.
Please write whether you agree to this proposition.
Yours faithfully, N.

M.
, We have had a letter today from Petersburg that our plan for a visit of the Social-Democratic deputies here is close to fulfilment (extra-conspiratively: it has been decided not to say a word to anyone except you).
In addition to the six supporters of Pravda it is possible, they write, that Tulyakov, Buryanov, Khaustov and even, maybe, Mankov may come.
Probably they will manage to draw in some of the workers as well (non-deputies).
Write, please, whether you could come (for a number of lectures, or talks, or classes, just as you please).
It would be a fine thing! Seven kilometres from here by rail is Zakopane, a very good health resort.
As regards money for the journey, we shall raise it, in all probability (so they write).
We can collect and send you all the information about Zakopane as a health resort.
If your health permits, do come for a short time! You would meet more workers, after the ones at London 128 and the Capri school.
Malinovsky wanted to visit you but didn’t manage it, he was short of time.
He and all the deputies send you warm greetings.
I await your reply.
Yours, Lenin The newspapers are full of reports about the “conflict”.
129 I think they are going to stifle Pravda for us.
Maklakovwill bring this off one way or another—by-passing the Duma, against the Duma or in some other way, but bring it off he will! 130 In that case we shall turn again to illegal literature— but we have no money.
Hasn’t the “merchant” begun to contribute yet? It is time, just the right time.

M.
, I have kept on intending to write to you, and then put-ting it off on account of my wife’s operation.
The other day at last the operation took place, and things are now on the mend.
The operation proved a rather difficult one: I am very glad indeed that we managed to get Kochor to operate.
Now to business.
You wrote that you would be in Berlin in August.
When in August? At the beginning or at the end? We intend to leave here on August 4.
Our tickets take us through Zurich, Munich and Vienna, and we shall break the journey in each of these cities.
(Possibly the doctor will not let us leave so soon as the 4th: in that case we shall postpone it again.
) Couldn’t we see each other somewhere? In all probabili-ty it would suit you to travel through Berne, or through Zurich, or through Munich, wouldn’t it? There is great need for us to meet.
The closing down of Pravda creates a devilishly difficult situation.
Perhaps we could think of something.
Then in Berlin you could do a very great deal for us, i.
e.
, for Pravda.
Therefore I beg you to write immediately, be it only two words, whether our meeting is possible, either here or in the places mentioned, at the beginning of August? If it is impossible, I will write to you about everything in great-er detail, particularly about the school (the arrest of theorganiser * has spoilt things for us damnably; we are looking for another).
I shake your hand warmly and wish you the best of luck, and most of all health for the journey.

Sorry.
How devilishly furious I was in Berne, and later!! I thought: if you were in Verona (the telegram from you about Bebel was from Verona)—or in some Rom.

What you write about your illness worries me terribly.
Are you doing the right thing in living without treatment at Capri? The Germans have excellent sanatoria (for exam-ple, at St.
Blasien, near Switzerland) where they treat and completely cure lung diseases, achieve complete healing, feed you up, then systematically accustom you to cold, harden you against catching cold, and turn out fit people, able to work.
While you, after Capri, and in winter, want to go to Russia???? I am terribly afraid that this will injure your health and undermine your working capacity.
Are there first-class doctors in that Italy of yours?? Really, go and visit some first-class doctor in Switzerland * or Germany, and set about a couple of months of serious treatment in a good sanatorium.
Because to squander official property, i.
e.
, to go on being ill and undermining your working capacity, is something quite intolerable in every respect.
* I can find out names and addresses.
I have heard (from the editor of Prosveshcheniye, who saw Ladyzhnikov) that you are dissatisfied with Pravda.
Because it’s dry? That is true.
But it’s not easy to correct this defect all at once.
We haven’t the people.
With great difficulty, one year after it started, we secured a merely tolerable editorial board in Petersburg.
(I have forwarded your letter to Prosveshcheniye.
) Write what your plans are, and what your health is like.
I earnestly ask you to set about your treatment seriously— really, it is quite possible to be cured, and to let it go on is simply outrageous and criminal.

60 1 3 8 ), then the Six must without fail declare calmly, briefly and firmly: “We are the Social-Democratic Labour group, since we act in keeping with the Will of the majority of the class-conscious workers, put it into effect, and represent the majority.
The seven non-Party deputies have not refuted a single fact, a single figure, out of the mass quoted in our paper and demonstrating this truth.
Here is our address; write to us, worker comrades, and do not imagine that we shall insult you by thinking you capable of believing the theory that ‘seven deputies are higher than the Party, higher than the will of the majority of the workers’.
Even 77 deputies could not be higher than that will.
We are strictly fulfilling it.
” Such a brief declaration is essential.
Then you should send a formal statement to Senior Conventus (i.
e.
, to the State Duma).
Then the Seven will very rapidly, at once lose their arrogance: very, very rapidly they will agreeto equality (which all of them have recognised in writing).
Neither they nor anyone else will have any other way out.
Once you have begun a job, you can’t back out.
The Six have made a splendid beginning, and their victory is assured, if they carry on correctly—in a week or two their victory is inevitable.

But Za Pravda is late every day.
We earnestly ask you to take steps to see that the paper is sent daily in good time, and without delay.
That the majority is for the Six is clear.
But the conduct of the Six is inconsistent.
Victory is within their grasp, if they take the logically (and politically) inevitable step and proclaim themselves a separate group.
Once this is done, and a statement handed in to the Duma, the Seven will he obliged (by the very technique of work in the Duma) to enter into an agreement with the Six.
It would be ridiculous to let victory slip from their hands when it is completely assured.
The more resolutely they separate, the more speedily will federation be restored.
The campaign against the Seven began excellently, but is now being carried on with insufficient determination.
In reply to the most shameless insolence of the liquidators, the newspaper needs not to complain but to attack, stressing the infringement of the will of the proletariat by the Seven, and their anti-Party character.
The watchword should be: “Resign your seats, gentlemen of the Seven, if you don’t want to reckon with the will of the majority of the workers, if you want to go against the Party.
” This watchword should be made quite clear and precise, repeating it daily.

One big article, with subheads.
We send you the text.
* Put in the resolution of the Con-ference 1 3 9 (was it on account of that resolution that that issue of Za Pravdu was confiscated?).
You should demand that the Seven resign their seats.
Add the results of the Petersburg resolutions, if they are clearly in our favour.

54 TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF Z A P R A V D U Dear Colleagues, I hasten to congratulate with all my heart all Marxist workers on the victory of the cause of the majority against the disorganisers, on the setting up of a group which does not wish to thwart the will of the majority.

The calculations are particularly good—they should be continued.
Once again, greetings to all from all.

M.
, Whatever are you doing? This is simply terrible, it really is! Yesterday I read your reply in Rech to the “howling” over Dostoyevsky, 1 4 2 and was preparing to rejoice, but today the liquidators’ paper arrives, and in it there is a paragraph of your article which was not in Rech.
This paragraph runs as follows: “And ‘god-seeking’ should be for the time being” (only for the time being?) “put aside—it is a useless occupation: it’s no use seeking where there is nothing to be found.
Unless you sow, you cannot reap.
You have no God, you have not yet” (yet!) “created him.
Gods are not sought—they are created; people do not invent life, they create it.
” So it turns out that you are against “god-seeking” only “for the time being”!! It turns out that you are against god-seeking only in order to replace it by god-building!! Well, isn’t it horrible that such a thing should appear in your article? God-seeking differs from god-building or god-creating or god-making, etc.
, no more than a yellow devil differs from a blue devil.
To talk about god-seeking, not in order to declare against all devils and gods, against every ideol-ogical necrophily (all worship of a divinity is necrophily— be it the cleanest, most ideal, not sought-out but built-up divinity, it’s all the same), but to prefer a blue devil to a yellow one is a hundred times worse than not saving anything about it at all.
In the freest countries, in countries where it is quite out of place to appeal “to democracy, to the people, to public opinion and science”, in such countries (America, Switzerland and so forth) particular zeal is applied to render the people and the workers obtuse with just this very idea of a clean, spiritual, built-up god.
Just because any religious idea, any idea of any god at all, any flirtation even with a god, is the most inexpressible foulness, particularly tolerantly (and often even favourably) accepted by the democratic bourgeoisie—for that very reason it is the most dangerous foulness, the most shameful “infection”.
A mil-lion physical sins, dirty tricks, acts of violence and infec-tions are much more easily discovered by the crowd, and therefore are much less dangerous, than the subtle, spiritual idea of god, dressed up in the most attractive “ideological” costumes.
The Catholic priest corrupting young girls (about whom I have just read by chance in a German newspaper) is much less dangerous, precisely to “democracy”, than a priest without his robes, a priest without crude religion, an ideologically equipped and democratic priest preaching the creation and the invention of a god.
For it is easy to expose, condemn and expel the first priest, while the sec-ond cannot be expelled so simply; to expose the latter is 1,000 times more difficult, and not a single “frail and pitifully wavering” philistine will agree to “condemn” him.
And you, knowing’ the “frailty and pitiful wavering” of the (Russian: why Russian? Is the Italian an better??) philistine soul, confuse that soul with the sweetest of poisons, most effectively disguised in lollipops and all kinds of gaily-coloured wrappings!! Really, it is terrible.
“Enough of self-humiliation, which is our substitute for self-criticism.
” And isn’t god-building the worst form of self-humilia-tion?? Everyone who sets about building up a God, or who even merely tolerates such activity, humiliates himself in the worst possible way, because instead of “deeds” he is actually engaged in self-contemplation, self-admira-tion and, moreover, such a man “contemplates” the dirt-iest, most stupid, most slavish features or traits of his “ego”, deified by god-building.
From the point of view, not of the individual, but of society, all god-building is precisely the fond self-contemp-lation of the thick-witted philistine, the frail man in the street, the dreamy “self-humiliation” of the vulgar petty bourgeois, “exhausted and in despair” (as you condescended to say very truly about the soul: only you should have said, not “the Russian”, but the petty-bourgeois, for the Jewish, the Italian, the English varieties are all one and the same devil; stinking philistinism everywhere is equally disgust-ing—but “democratic philistinism”, occupied in ideol-ogical necrophily, is particularly disgusting).
Reading your article over and over again, and trying to discover where this slip of your tongue could come from, I am at a loss.
What does it mean? A relic of the “Con-fession”, which you yourself did not approve?? Or its echo?? Or something different: for example, an unsuccessful attempt to bend back to the viewpoint of democracy in gen-eral, instead of the viewpoint of the proletariat? Perhaps it was in order to talk with “democracy in general” that you decided (excuse the expression) to indulge in baby-talk? Perhaps it was “for a popular exposition” to the philistines that you decided to accept for a moment their, the philistines’, prejudices?? But then that is a wrong approach, in all senses and in all respects! I wrote above that in democratic countries it would be quite out of place for a proletarian writer to appeal “to democracy, to the people, to public opinion and science”.
Well, but what about us in Russia?? Such an appeal is not quite appropriate, because it also in some ways flatters the prejudices of the philistines.
A kind of general appeal, general to the point of vagueness—even Izgoyev of Russkaya Mysl 143 will sign it with both hands.
Why then select watch-words which you distinguish perfectly well from those of Izgoyev, but which the reader will not be able to distin-guish?? Why throw a democratic veil over the question for the reader, instead of clearly distinguishing the petty bourgeois (frail, pitifully wavering, exhausted, despairing, self-contemplating, god-contemplating, god-building, god-indulging, self-humiliating, uncomprehendingly-anarchistic— wonderful word!!—et cetera, et cetera)— from the proletarians (who know how to be of good cheer not only in words, and who are able to distinguish the “science and public opinion” of the bourgeoisie from their own, bourgeois democracy from proletarian democracy)? Why do you do this? It’s damnably disappointing.

* On the question of god, the god-like and everything connected with it, there is a contradiction in your posi-tion—the same, I think, which I used to point out in our talks when we last met in Capri.
You broke (or appeared to break) with the Vperyod people, without having noticed the ideological basis of “Vperyodism”.
The same has happened now.
You are “most vexed”, you “cannot understand how the words ‘for the time being’ crept in”—that is how you write—and yet at the same time you defend the idea of God and god-building.
“God is the complex of those ideas, worked out by the tribe, the nation, mankind, which awaken and organise social feelings, having as their object to link the individ-ual with society and to bridle zoological individualism.
” This theory is obviously connected with the theory or theories of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky.
And it is clearly wrong and clearly reactionary.
Like the Christian socialists (the worst variety of “socialism”, and its worst distortion), you make use of a method which (despite your best intentions) repeats the hocus-pocus of the priests: you eliminate from the idea of God everything about it that is historical and drawn from real life (filth, prejudices, sanctified ignorance and degradation, on the one hand, serfdom and monarchy, on the other), and in-stead of the reality of history and life there is substi-tuted in the idea of God a gentle petty-bourgeois phrase (God= “ideas which awaken and organise social feelings”).
* The beginning of the letter has never been found.
—Ed.
Your wish in so doing is to say something “good and kind”, to point out “truth and justice” and the like.
But your good wish remains your personal affair, a subjective “inno-cent desire”.
Once you have written it down, it goes out among the masses, and its significance is determined not by your good wishes, but by the relationship of social forces, the objective relationship of classes.
By virtue of that relationship it turns out (irrespective of your will and in-dependently of your consciousness) that you have put a good colour and a sugary coating on the idea of the cleri-cals, the Purishkeviches, Nicholas II and the Struves, 1 4 5 since in practice the idea of God helps them keep the people in slavery.
By beautifying the idea of god, you have beau-tified the chains with which they fetter ignorant workers and peasants.
There—the priests and, Co.
will say—what a good and profound idea this is (the idea of God), as even “ your” leaders recognise, Messrs.
democrats: and we (the priests and Co.
) serve that idea.
It is untrue that god is the complex of ideas which awaken and organise social feelings.
That is Bogdanov idealism, which suppresses the material origin of ideas.
God is (in history and in real life) first of all the complex of ideas generated by the brutish subjection of man both by ex-ternal nature and by the class yoke—ideas which consoli-date that subjection, lull to sleep the class struggle.
There was a time in history when, in spite of such an origin and such a real meaning of the idea of God, the struggle .
of democracy and of the proletariat went on in the form of a struggle of one religious idea against another.
But that time, too, is long past.
Nowadays both in Europe and in Russia any, even the most refined and best-intentioned defence or justification of the idea of God is a justification of reaction.
Your entire definition is reactionary and bourgeois, through and through.
God = the complex of ideas which awaken and organise social feelings, having as their object to link the individual with society and to bridle zoological individualism Why is this reactionary? Because it falsely colours the idea of “bridling” zoology preached by priests and feudals.
In reality, “zoological individualism ” was bridled not bythe idea of God, it was bridled both by the primitive herd and the primitive community.
The idea of God always put to sleep and blunted the “social feelings”, replacing the living by the dead, being always the idea of slavery (the worst, hopeless slavery).
Never has the idea of God “linked the individual with society”: it has always tied the oppressed classes hand and foot with faith in the divinity of the oppressors.
Your definition is bourgeois (and not scientific, not historical) because it operates with sweeping, general, “Robinson Crusoe” conceptions in general, not with definite classes in a definite historical epoch.
The idea of God among the Zyrian savages, etc.
(includ-ing semi-savages) is one thing.
With Struve and Co.
it is something quite different.
In both cases class domina-tion supports this idea (and this idea supports it).
The “popular ” conception of God and the divine is “popular” ignorance, degradation, darkness, just like the “popular conception” of the tsar, the devil and dragging wives by the hair.
I completely fail to understand how you can call the “popular conception” of God “democratic ” .
It is untrue that philosophical idealism “always has in view only the interests of the individual”.
Did Descartes have the interests of the individual more in mind than Gassendi? Or Fichte and Hegel as compared with Feuerbach? That “god-building is the process of the further develop-ment and accumulation of social elements in the individual and society” is simply terrible!! If there were freedom in Russia, the entire bourgeoisie would praise you to the skies for such things, for such sociology and theology of a purely bourgeois type and character.
Well, that’s enough for the time being: this letter is too long as it is.
Once again, I shake your hand and wish you good health.

* Idiotically stupid are the people who have “taken as something allegedly “in-fright” at trusted agents, sulting” to the Party cells.
That means, the argument runs, that, there are no Party cells if they want trusted agents! 148 Comedians! They chase words, without thinking about how devilishly complicated and subtle life is, producing entirely new forms, which we only partly “catch on” to.
People for the most part (99 per cent of the bourgeoisie, 98 per cent of the liquidators, about 60-70 per cent of the Bolsheviks) don’t know how to think, they only learn words by heart.
They’ve learnt the word “underground”.
Firmly.
They can repeat it.
They know it by heart.
But how to change its forms in a new situation, how to learn and think anew for this purpose, this we do not under-stand.
The summer conference of 1913 (abroad) decided to over-come the Seven.
The campaign of the working masses in the autumn of 1913 in Russia—the majority are for us!! A “circle” of “trusted agents” (without election by the Party cells!! Alarm!!—shout Antonov, Isaac and Co.
) decided— and the masses carried it out.
How can that be done? Well, that, is where one must learn to understand such a “cunning” mechanism.
It could not have been done, were there no underground and no Party cells.
And it could not have been done, if there were no new and cunning forms of the underground and the Party cells.

I hope you have read in the German Social-Democratic papers (Vorwärts and Leipziger Volkszeitung) the articles of our opponents (for example, J.
K.
of the Rosa Luxemburg group, and Z.
L.
, who represents no group in Russia, in Leipziger Volkszeitung).
The German Social-Democratic press is boycotting us, particularly Vorwärts, and only Leipziger Volkszeitung has printed one article from us (signed by the editorial board of Sotsial-Demokrat, Central Organ of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party * ).
In Bremer Bürger-Zeitung 1 5 1 Radek writes about Rus-sian affairs.
Yet Radek also represents no group whatever in Russia! It is ridiculous to print articles by emigrants who represent nothing, and not accept articles from the representatives of organisations which exist in Russia! And the attitude of Kautsky—can anything be more idiotic? In relation to all other countries he studies the history of the movement, criticises documents, tries to understand the true sense of the differences, the political significance of splits.
In relation to Russia, history does not exist for him.
Today he repeats what he has heard from * See “The Split in the Russian Social-Democratic Duma Group” (present edition, Vol.
19, pp.
480-84).
—Ed.
Rosa Luxemburg, yesterday he repeated what he had heard from Trotsky, Ryazanov and other writers who only represent their own “pious wishes”, tomorrow he will begin to repeat what other Russian students or emigrants are kind enough to tell him, and so on.
While in Neue Zeit (!!) only common-places, declamations, no facts, no understanding of the essence of the questions on which we differ!! Pure childish-ness!! We are being lectured on unity with the liquidators of our Party—an absurdity.
It is we who are bringing unity into being, by rallying the workers of Russia against the liquidators of our Party.
I attach a document which we circulated to members of the International Socialist Bureau.
You will find there facts and figures which prove that we are the ones who represent the unity of the Party (and the vast majority of the workers) in Russia against groups of liquidators who are without workers.
Unfortunately even Pannekoek in Bremer Bürger-Zeitung refuses to understand that you have to print the articles of the two wings of Social-Democracy in Russia, and not the articles of Radek who represents only his own personal ignorance and fantasy, and who does not wish to provide precise facts.
Once again I thank you, dear Comrade Wijnkoop, you personally and the Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party, for your kind letter, and please pass on my greetings to Comrade Gorter.
I hope you will forgive my bad French.

2 1 , January 2 1 , 1 9 3 4 Printed from the original62 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I send you the draft Ukrainian appeal for Shakhtyorsky Listok, 1 5 2 and particularly ask you to be tactful in getting it adopted (not on my behalf, of course, and better not in your name either) through Lola 1 5 3 and two or three Ukrainians (of course, against Yurkevich and, if possible, without the knowledge of this disgusting, rotten national-ist philistine, who under the flag of Marxism is preaching the division of the workers by nationalities, a special nation-al organisation of the Ukrainian workers).
You will understand why it is inconvenient for me to send such a draft in my own name.
Lola wrote to me that he agrees with me against Yurkevich, but Lola is naïve.
The matter, however, must not drag on.
It is terribly important that a voice should be heard from amongst the Ukrainian Social-Democrats for unity against dividing up the workers by nations.
And now Shakhtyorsky Listok (received by me only today, Wednesday, April 1, as a supplement to the Sunday Put Pravdy) should immediately be made use of for this purpose.
Rewrite my draft (I agree to all changes, of course, if only there remains the direct protest against the division by nations); let Lola alone or with someone else, etc.
, accept and translate it into Ukrainian, and then send it through me to Put Pravdy in his name or (better) on behalf of a group (though it be of two or three people) of Ukrainian Marxists (still better, Ukrainian workers).
This should be done tactfully, quickly, against Yur-kevich and without his knowledge, because this twister will make trouble.
(I have received your story of Stepanyuk’s report and the speech by Yurkevich; frankly speaking, I was angry with you—you didn’t understand what the essence of Yurkevich’s position was.
And I again—I’m sorry—called you the Holy Virgin.
Please don’t be angry, it was because I’m fond of you, because we’re friends, but I can’t help being angry when I see “something that recalls the Holy Virgin”.

I have been expecting any day the same volume (Agri-culture) of the 13th Census (Census of 1910), but for some reason it does not arrive.

I will immediately send you the cost of postage.
Please note my new address: Poronin (Galizien).
Congratulations on the splendid May Day in Russia: 250,000 in Petersburg alone!! Put Pravdy for May 1 has been confiscated, but I have learned from Novy Mir 1 5 9 that you often get confiscated issues as well.

I hope you will reply when you have read the end of the article on self-determination of nations (I am writing it just now) in Prosveshcheniye.
* Regarding your pamphlet against An, be sure to send a Selbstanzeige, or exposition, to Prosveshcheniye.
161 I propose the following plan to you in addition.
In order to combat the stupidity of the “cultural-national autonom-ists”, it is necessary for the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group to bring in a Bill in the Duma for the equality of nations and the defence of the rights of national minori-ties.
Let’s draft such a Bill.
1 6 2 The general principles of equality—the division of the country into autonomous and self-governing territorial units according to, among other things, nationality (the local population indicates the boun-daries, the State Parliament endorses them)—the limits of powers of autonomous regions and areas, as well as of self-governing local units—illegality of any departure from the equality of nations in the decisions of the autonomous regions, Zemstvos, etc.
; common school councils, democrat-ically elected, etc.
, freedom and equality of language— choice of languages by municipal institutions, etc.
— defence of minorities: the right to a proportional share of * See “The Right of Nations to edition, Vol.
20, pp.
393-454).
—Ed.
Self-Determination” (presentexpenditure, to school premises (free) for pupils of “alien” nationalities, to have “alien” teachers, “alien” depart-ments in museums and libraries, theatres, etc.
—the right of every citizen to seek cancellation (by the courts) of every departure from equality in respect of any “infringement” of the rights of national minorities (five-year censuses of the population in mixed regions, ten-year censuses in the state as a whole), etc.
I have a feeling that by this means we could give a popular explanation of the stupidity of cultural-national autonomy and kill the supporters of this stupidity for good.
The Bill might be drafted by the Marxists of all, or of very many, nations of Russia.
Write immediately whether you agree to help in this.
In general, write more frequently, not less than once a week.
It is unforgivable to put off replying for a long time: have this in mind, especially now!! All the best, Yours, V.

1 6 3 There’s balderdash and stu-pidity! To combine together as much as possible of every kind of “horror”, to collect in one story “vice” and “syphi-lis” and romantic crime, with extortion of money by means of blackmail (with the sister of the blackmailed person turned into a mistress), and the trial of the doctor! All this with hysterical outbursts, eccentricities, claims of having one’s “own” theory of organising prostitutes.
This organisation represents nothing bad in itself; but it is the author, Vinnichenko himself, who makes nonsense of it, smacks his lips over it, makes it his “hobby horse”.
The review in Rech says that it is an imitation of Dostoyev-sky and that there are good parts in it.
There is an imitation, in my opinion, and a supremely bad imitation of the su-premely bad in Dostoyevsky.
Of course, in real life there are individual cases of all the “horrors” which Vinnichenko describes.
But to lump them all together, and in such a way, means laying on the horrors with a trowel, frightening both one’s own imagination and the reader’s, “stunning” both oneself and the reader.
Once I had to spend a night with a sick comrade (delirium tremens), and once I had to “talk round” a comrade who had attempted suicide (after the attempt), and who some years later did commit suicide.
Both recollections à la Vinnichen-* The words “my dear friend” were written by Lenin in English.

But in both cases these were small fragments of the lives of both comrades.

What could be more busi-ness-like and practical? We put ours forward, you put yours, and then we shall see.
Either we adopt common decisions, or let us each report to our congresses, to the Congress of our Party.

) The essential thing, in my opinion, is to prove that only we are the Party (the other side are a fictitious bloc or tiny groups), only we are a workers’ party (on the other side are the bourgeoisie, who provide money and appro-val), only we are the majority, four-fifths.
This is the first thing.
And the second is to explain in as popular language as possible (I should absolutely fail in this, not knowing the language, while you will succeed) that the Organising Committee= a fiction.
The reality which it conceals is merely a group of liquidationist writers in St.

The first two belong to the opposition.

S.

P.
—if that suits your legitimists, who want to “consider” the liqui-dators a little).
Here clarity and honesty are necessary.
In 1911-14 the Letts (their C.

At the Congress of 1914 1 6 9 they became opponents of liquidationism, but neutral as between the O.

and the C.
C.
Now, after Brussels, after the resolution in No.
32 of Trudovaya Pravda, 170 the Letts want to enter our Party and conclude an agreement with the C.
C.
Is this a good thing? It is good, if what is being done is clearly understood and there is an honest attitude towards it.
It is bad, if it is being done without clear understanding, without firm resolution and reckoning with the consequences.
Those who want legitimacy in the sense of restoring the Stockholm-London (1906-07) R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, had better not join our Party: there will be no result except squabbles, disap-pointments, offence taken and mutual hindrance.
That was “a federation of the worst type” (as was stated in the resolution of the January 1912 Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
1 7 1 It was rottenness.
Away with that rotten-ness!If it is a question of defending the relics of federalism (for example, the Stockholm agreement and delegation from the Lettish C.
C.
to the Russian C.
C.
1 7 2 ), then it’s a waste of time! In my belief we shall not accept it.
It is play-acting, diplomacy à la Tyszka (which is now being imitated by the scoundrels in the Polish opposition, who went over at Brussels to the liquidators), not team work.
Are we agreed in principle? Yes or no? If the answer is yes, then we must march together against (1) liquidationism, (2) “nationalism” (= (a) “cultural-national autonomy” and (b) the separatism of the Bund), (3) against federal-ism.
We have clearly, openly, before all the workers of Rus-sia, unfurled these banners since January 191.
That is not a short time.
You could and should have realised what was involved.
So let’s come to an agreement—if we are to agree— clearly and honestly.
To play at hide-and-seek, in my opinion, is out of place and unworthy.
We are waging a serious war: against us are all the bourgeois intellectuals, the liquidators, the nationalists and the separatists of the Bund, the federalists overt and covert.
Either we conclude an agreement against all these enemies, or it would be better put off.
It is better to confine ourselves to engagement than to tie ourselves up with marriage, if there is no complete certainty that the union will endure!! All this is my personal opinion.
But I should very much like to come to an understanding with you and to reach clarity.
If we came to an agreement on fundamentals at Brussels, we can and must ask ourselves without diplomacy whether we can agree on a stable treaty.
I am very worried that part of the Letts are for cultural-national autonomy, or wavering, for Bundist federalism, or wavering, hesitating to attack the nationalism and separatism of the Bund, hesitating to support our demand that the liquidation-ist paper of a group of disorganisers in Petersburg 173 should be closed, etc.
Is it a great part? in general and among members of the Central Committee? among the workers and among the intellectuals? Is it influential? After all, it is we who are waging the battle against the liquidators in Petersburg and throughout Russia.
What is to be done if you cannot conscientiously help us fight the liquidators and the Bundists?? To conclude a lasting agreement in that case would be dishonest, and simply unrealistic! And now, in addition, there is this disgusting manoeuvre of the Polish opposition in favour of the liquidators (voting for the Brussels resolution), 174 for nationalism (recognition of cultural-national autonomy as “an arguable proposition”), for federalism (the demand for the old, Tyszka, agreement of 1906 with the P.
S.
D.
* ).
Clarity, clarity before everything else! Anyone who has not realised the state and the circumstances of the war of proletarian democracy against bourgeois democracy (= the liquidators and the nationalists) had better wait.

ENCYCLOPAEDIC DICTIONARY July 21, 1914 Dear Colleague, To my greatest regret, a number of quite exceptional and unforeseen circumstances (beginning with the resignation of Malinovsky) obliged me at the very beginning to inter-rupt the article on Marx 176 which I had begun, and after several unsuccessful attempts to find time to con-tinue it, I have been forced to the conclusion that I shall not be able to do this work before the autumn.

ENCYCLOPAEDIC DICTIONARY Dear Colleague, Some days ago, despairing of any opportunity to finish the work, I sent you a letter giving it up, with my apologies.
* But now the political circumstances on which I am so extremely dependent are suddenly changing again in radi-cal fashion.
First of all, the exceptional security measures in St.
Petersburg, about which I read today in the Russian papers, are to remain in force until September 4, 1914, evi-dently meaning that the paper for which I was writing is stopped until then.
Secondly, the war will, it seems, inter-rupt a number of urgent political affairs with which I was burdened.
Therefore I could now set about continuing the article on Marx which I have begun, and could probably finish it soon.

It might, perhaps, be better to give a talk about the critique and my anti-critique.
Two words nevertheless: one cannot on formal grounds defend the scoundrelly chau-vinism of the Germans.

KARPINSKY Dear Karpinsky, I am taking advantage of this messenger to speak openly.
There is every ground for expecting that the Swiss police and military authorities (at the first signal from the Rus-sian or French Ambassador, etc.
) will bring us before a military tribunal or expel us for breach of neutrality, etc.
Therefore don’t write anything openly in your letters.
If you have to communicate anything, write in chemicals (the sign of chemicals is the date on the letter underlined).
We have decided to publish the attached manifesto, in-stead of the not very readable theses.
179 Let us know when you get it, calling the manifesto “The Development of Capitalism ” .
It ought to be published.
But we advise you to do this only on condition that you take (are able to take) the maxi-mum precautions!! No one should know where and by whom it was published.
All rough copies should be burned!! The copies printed should be kept only by some influential Swiss citizen, deputy and so forth.
If this is impossible, don’t print it.
If it cannot be printed, do it on a mimeograph (also with the greatest precautions).
Reply: I have received the development of capitalism (in so many) copies= I shall reprint it in so many copies.
If it cannot be published, either in print or mimeographed, write immediately.
We shall think of something else.
Reply in as much detail as possible.

KARPINSKY Dear Friend, I spoke here today at Plekhanov’s lecture, against his chauvinism.
1 8 1 I intend to deliver a lecture here on Tues-day.
I should like to lecture at Geneva (the European war and European socialism) on Wednesday.
182 Arrange it, after proper discussion—as conspiratively as possible, i.
e.
, so that no permission will be required (of course, it is also desirable that there should be a maximum audience).
You are the best judge of how to do this.
It should combine the maximum audience with the minimum of police public-ity and police interference (or police threats).
At Berne I lectured to members of the groups and guests whom they recommended (about 120-130 persons), without notices, etc.
Would not this method be best? Reply immediately to Mr.
Ryvline.

For me.
On Tuesday I am lecturing here at Lausanne, and your reply should be here by Tues-day afternoon.
When we meet, we can have a more detailed talk about our affairs.
And so, if permission is required at Geneva, then think it over ten times, whether a closed meet-ing would not be best.
In general, of course, you decide.
If it is all right for Wednesday (to arrange the lecture for Wednesday evening), I will arrive on Wednesday morning.

KARPINSKY Dear K.
, Just while I was staying in Geneva joyful news arrived from Russia.
There also arrived the text of the reply of the Russian Social-Democrats to Vandervelde.
183 We there-fore decided to publish, instead of a separate manifesto, the next issue of the Central Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat.
1 8 4 Today this decision will be finally shaped, so to speak.
And so, please take all the necessary steps as soon as possible to find a Frenchman, i.
e.
, a Swiss citizen, as a responsible editor, and to determine the costs.
We think of two pages as the size, with a format something like that of the Paris Golos.
1 8 5 The dates of publication will be in-definite—hardly more often than two or three times a month at first.
The printing will be small, because with our orientation we cannot reckon on the man in the street (500 copies?).
The price is to be about 10 centimes.
All this is still assumption, but you need to know it for the discussion with the compositor.
And so, the price? How long is needed for the publication (setting, etc.
) of an issue of that size? Then the type? Is there only one large size, or is there also a small size, brevier? How many thousand letters and spaces will go into two pages of Golos format of (1) large type and (2) small type, brevier? You should not distribute the type of the manifesto which has already been set: we shall fit it into the paper.
By Monday we shall send you some small amendmentsto the manifesto, and a different signature (because after contact with Russia we are now acting more officially).
A thousand greetings! Yours, Lenin P.

SHLYAPNIKOV 186 October 17, 1914 Dear Friend, I arrived home last night after my lecture tour and found your letters.
Heartiest greetings to you, and, through you, to all Russian friends.
The reply to Vandervelde was given to a translator yesterday, and I have not yet seen the text.
I will write about it as soon as I see it.
In my view the most important thing now is a consistent and organised struggle against the chauvinism which has seized upon the whole bourgeoisie and the majority of the opportunist socialists (and those making their peace with opportunism—like Mr.
Kautsky!).
And to perform the tasks imposed by this struggle it is first of all necessary to com-bat the chauvinism of one’s own country—specifically, in Russia the gentry à la Maslov and Smirnov (see Russkiye Vedomosti and Russkoye Slovo) whose “works” I have read,187 or Messrs.
Sokolov, Meshkovsky, Nikitin and others whom you have seen or heard.
Plekhanov, as I think you have already been told, has become a French chauvinist.
Among the liquidators there is evidently confusion.
* Alexinsky, they say, is a Francophil.
Kosovsky (the Bundist, a Right-winger, I heard his lecture) is a Germanophil.
** It seems * Our intellectuals in Paris (outvoted in the section by the work-ers) have gone as volunteers (Nik.
Vas.
, Antonov and others) and have issued a stupid non-Party appeal 1 8 8 jointly with the S.
R.
s.
It has been sent to you.
** Martov is behaving most decently of all in Golos.
But will Martov hold out? I don ’ t believe it.
as though the middle course of the whole “Brussels bloc” 189 of the liquidator gentry with Alexinsky and Plekhanov will be adapting themselves to Kautsky, who now is more harm-ful than anyone else.
How dangerous and scoundrelly his sophistry is, covering up the dirty tricks of the opportunists with the most smooth and facile phrases (in Neue Zeit 1 9 0 ).
The opportunists are an obvious evil.
The German “Centre” headed by Kautsky is a concealed evil, diplomatically coloured over, contaminating the eyes, the mind and the conscience of the workers, and more dangerous than any-thing else.
Our task now is the unconditional and open strug-gle against international opportunism and those who screen it (Kautsky).
And this is what we shall do in the Central Organ, which we shall shortly issue (probably two little pages).
We must with all our strength now support the legit-imate hatred of the class-conscious workers for the rotten be-haviour of the Germans, and draw from this hatred a polit-ical conclusion against opportunism and any concession to it.
This is an international task.
It devolves on us, there is no one else.
We must not retreat from it.
It is wrong to put forward the watchword of the “simple” restoration of the International (for the danger of a rotten conciliatory reso-lution on the Kautsky-Vandervelde line is very, very great!).
The watchword of “peace” is wrong: the watchword should be transformation of the national war into a civil war.
(This transformation may be a long job, it may require and will require a number of preliminary conditions, but all the work should be carried on in the direction of precisely such a transformation, in that spirit and on that line.
) Not sabotage of the war, not separate, individual actions in that spirit, but mass propaganda (not only among “civilians”) leading to the transformation of the war into a civil war.
In Russia chauvinism hides behind phrases about “la belle France” and unfortunate Belgium (and what about the Ukraine, etc.
?) or behind “popular” hatred of the Ger-mans (and of “Kaiserism”).
Therefore our unquestionable duty is to combat these sophistries.
And in order that the struggle should proceed along precise and clear lines we need a watchword which generalises it.
That watchword is: for us Russians, from the point of view of the interests of the working masses and the working class of Russia, there cannot be the smallest doubt, absolutely any doubt, that the lesser evil would be now, at once the defeat of tsarism in this war.
For tsarism is a hundred times worse than Kaiserism.
Not sabotage of the war, but the struggle against chauvinism and the concentration of all propaganda and agitation on the international rallying (rapprochement, solidarity, agreement, selon les circonstances * ) of the pro-letariat for the purpose of civil war.
It would be a mistake both to call for individual acts of shooting officers, etc.
, and to tolerate arguments like the one that “we don’t want to help Kaiserism”.
The first is a deviation towards anarch-ism, the second towards opportunism.
We, on the con-trary, must prepare mass (or at the very least collective) action among the troops—not only of one nation—and carry on all propaganda and agitation work in that direc-tion.
The direction of our work (stubborn, systematic, maybe protracted) in the spirit of turning the national war into a civil war—there is the crux of the matter.
The time for this transformation is a different question, at present still unclear.
We must allow this moment to mature, and systematically “make it mature”.
This is all for the time being.
I will write frequently.
You write more often too.
Set forth in greater detail the leaflet of the Petersburg Committee.
More details about the views and reactions of the workers.
The balance of forces among the “groups” in St.
Peters-burg? That is, have the liquidators grown stronger as regards ourselves? To what extent? Is Dan at liberty? His position? And that of Chirkin, Bulkin and Co.
? More details.
To whom precisely, and in whose name, did you send a hundred rubles? All the very best, Yours, Lenin * According to circumstances.
—Ed.
The watchword of peace, in my opinion, is incorrect at the present moment.
It is a philistine, parson’s watchword.
The proletarian watchword must be civil war.
Objectively, from the radical change in the situation in Europe, such a watchword follows for the epoch of a mass war.
The same watchword follows from the Basle resolution.
191 We can neither “promise” civil war nor “decree” it, but to go on working—if necessary for a very long time—in that direction, we are in duty bound.
You will see the details in the Central Organ article.
* Meanwhile I am only indicating the main points of our position, so that we can reach a really good understanding.

SHLYAPNIKOV October 17, 1914 Dear Friend, I have read the reply to Vandervelde, and attach my ideas on the subject of that reply.
It would be extremely desirable that in the event of the Duma being convened (is it true that it is being summoned in a month’s time?) 1 9 2 our group should make a statement independent of the bloc, and should set forth a consistent point of view.
Reply at once (1) whether there will be a session of the Duma, (2) whether you have good contacts with the Duma group, 1 9 3 and how many days this will require.
October 21, 1914 I continue my interrupted letter.
My criticism of the reply, of course, is a private affair, intended only for friends with the object of reaching complete mutual understanding.
The Central Organ will appear in a day or two, and we shall send it to you.
About the International, don’t be an optimist, and beware of the intrigues of the liquidators and opportunists.
Al-though Martov is going left today, this is because he is alone.
But what will happen tomorrow? Tomorrow he will descend to their common plan: to stop the mouths (and the mind and the conscience) of the workers with an indiarubber reso-lution in the spirit of Kautsky, who justifies all and sundry.
Kautsky is the most hypocritical, most revolting and most harmful of all! It is internationalism, if you please, forthe workers of every country to shoot at the workers of another country under the guise of “defence of the father-land”!!! Let them intrigue—it is after all no more than a petty intrigue today, at such a moment in world history, to think of playing diplomacy with opportunism and setting up a “German” International Socialist Bureau! 194 We must today maintain our principles.
The workers of Petersburg are imbued with the best feelings of enmity to the traitors among the German Social-Democrats.
With all our strength we must support and consolidate that feeling and conscious-ness into firm resolution to fight international opportunism.
Up till now German Social-Democracy was the main author-ity—today it is a model of what not to do! You are needed in Stockholm.
Organise the correspon-dence with Russia as well as you can.
Send my letters (is that possible?) to the one who gave you a note in pencil: we must reach an understanding with him in as much detail as possible.
1 9 5 This is extremely important.
We are begin-ning publication of the Central Organ.

SHLYAPNIKOV October 27, 1914 Dear Friend, I have just received your second letter, and sit down to have a talk with you.
Many thanks for the letter about events in St.
Peters-burg.
1 9 6 It will make an excellent report for the Central Organ.
An issue of the Central Organ will be published in a few days, and we shall send it to you.
Wait for it.
Wait also for the next issue.
You must stay for the time being in Stockholm until transport through Stockholm (1) of let-ters, (2) of people and (3) of literature has been completely organised.
For this you should systematically train and test a good transmitting agent in Stockholm.
Is Comrade Skovno suitable for this? What’s good about her is that she is a Bolshevik.
She won’t go over to the other side.
But is she business-like, is she alert, does she attend to details? I am delighted if Comrade Kollontai 1 9 7 has taken up our position, and I am also glad at the excellent (on the whole) management of Golos by Martov in Paris.
But I am in deadly fear that Martov (and others akin to him) will go over .
.
.
to the position taken up by Kautsky and Troelstra.
I hate and despise Kautsky now more than anyone, with his vile, dirty self-satisfied hypocrisy.
Nothing has happened; so he says, principles have not been abandoned, everyone was entitled to defend his fatherland.
It is inter-nationalism, if you please, for the workers of all countries to shoot one another “in order to defend their fatherland”.
Rosa Luxemburg was right when she wrote, long ago, that Kautsky has the “subservience, of a theoretician ” —servility, in plainer language, servility to the majority of the Party, to opportunism.
Just now there is nothing in the world more harmful and dangerous for the ideological independence of the proletariat than this rotten self-satis-faction and disgusting hypocrisy of Kautsky, who wants to smother and cover up everything, to tranquillise the awak-ened conscience of the workers by sophistries and pseudo-scientific chatter.
If Kautsky succeeds in this, he will become the main representative of bourgeois corruption in the working-class movement.
And Troelstra will be for him —oh, that Troelstra is a more skilful opportunist than the “kind” little old man Kautsky! How that Troelstra mano-euvred in order to drive honest men and Marxists out of the Dutch Party (Gorter, Pannekoek, Wijnkoop)!! I shall never forget how Roland-Hoist, when she once visited me in Paris, said about Troelstra: “ein hundsgemeiner Kerl” (gredin, in French) * .
.
.
.
I am sorry that you cast pearls before him.
.
.
.
1 9 8 Troelstra & the opportunist scoundrels in the Vorstand** of the German Social-Democrats are carrying on a dirty little intrigue in order to cover everything up.
Be on your guard, don’t become the unwilling victim of that intrigue!! Don’t accidentally give any help to these worst enemies of the working-class movement, who in an epoch of crisis are defending chauvinism “theoretically”, and carrying on a petty and revolting diplomacy.
The only one who has told the workers the truth—although not loudly enough, and sometimes not quite skilfully—is Pan-nekoek, whose article we have sent to you (pass on a trans-lation to the Russians).
199 His words, that if now the “lead-ers” of the International that was murdered by the oppor-tunists and Kautsky come together and begin “papering over” the cracks, this “will be of no significance whatever”— these are the only socialist words.
They are the truth.
Bitter, but the truth.
And now the workers need the truth, the whole truth, more than at any other time, not rotten diplomacy, not playing at “papering over”, not smearing over the evil with indiarubber resolutions.
* “A scoundrelly son of a bitch.

** Executive or C.

—Ed.
It is clear to me that Kautsky, Troelstra plus Vander-velde (it may be plus X& Y& Z or minus X, Y, Z—this is not important) are now busy with an intrigue for that purpose.
The transfer of the International Bureau to Holland is a similar intrigue by the same scoundrels.
I shall keep away from them and from it—and will give the same advice to our representative in the International Socialist Bureau (Litvinoff, 76.
High Street.
Hampstead, London, N.
W.
)—and I advise you to do the same.
“Don’t attend the counsels of the impious”, 2 0 0 don’t put any faith in Troelstra, and the like, etc.
, etc.
, just present them with a brief ultimatum: here is the manifesto (a revision of the theses; we shall send it to you in print in a few days) of our C.
C.
on the war: do you want to pub-lish it in your language?? No? Well, then adieu, our roads diverge! If Kollontai is on our side, let her help to “push” this manifesto in the other languages.
Make the acquaintance of Höglund, a young Swedish Social-Democrat, leader of the “opposition”, read him our manifesto (refer to me: we became acquainted at Copenhagen).
Sound out whether he is ideologically close to us (he is only a naïve, sentimental anti-militarist: these are the very people who should be told—either the watchword of civil war, or remain with the opportunists and the chauvinists).
The essence of the whole problem in Russia now is to organise an ideological rebuff to the opportunists of the International and to Kautsky.
This is the key question.
Won’t Martov go over at this point??.

.
I fear so!.

SHLYAPNIKOV Für Alexander Dear Friend, In two or three days you will receive our Central Organ, and then I hope there will be complete “harmony” of our views.
Frankly speaking, I am a little afraid whether some of the steps you have taken may not be interpreted in the sense that you are ignoring our legitimate representative in the International Socialist Bureau—Mr.
Litvinoff, 76.
High Street.
Hampstead.
London, N.
W.
Of course, such an interpretation will be a malicious distortion, but all the same be more careful.
Troelstra has deceived you, or led you into error.
He is an arch-opportunist, and an agent of the intrigues of the most scoundrelly centre of the most scoundrelly opportu-nists—the German Social-Democrats (headed by Kautsky, who basely defends the opportunists), with their most foul Vorstand.
We shall not attend any conferences or join in any steps, taken on the initiative of scoundrels like them.
We will stand aside: let them disgrace themselves! For they, having disgraced themselves once, will disgrace them-selves again.
The French have already rejected their intrigues, and without the French there can be only a dirty comedy acted by dirty blackguards.
Larin, to all appearances, is swindling you without scruple.
If he expresses his “confidence” in the German Vorstand, I can well understand that Troelstra has “taken note of it”.
Of course he would!! Confidence in the rottenest opportunists!! For God’s sake correct what canbe corrected, and don’t express the least confidence, direct or indirect, in any of the opportunists, either German or French.
Pannekoek is right: the Second International is dead for ever.
It was killed by the opportunists (and not by “parliamentarism”, as the slow-witted Pannekoek put it).
“Papering over” the differences is only a petty intrigue, and we must take no part in it, either direct or indirect.
We shall try to send you a couple of leaflets shortly.
Don’t go away, have patience.
Arrange everything I wrote to you about, wait until the Central Organ has reached Russia, wait until we reach a complete understanding with the Russian colleagues too (both with Kamenev and with others), after they have received the Central Organ.
Before all this has been done there can be no thought of your depar-ture.
It would be premature for us as yet to leave.
2 0 1 Find out, by the way, whether Social-Democratic things can he printed in Sweden (as for example, our Central Organ).
Poor Gorky! What a pity that he has disgraced himself by putting his signature under that rotten little paper of the Russian liberal gentry.
2 0 2 Both Meshkovsky and Plekhanov and others (including Maslov and Smirnov) have sunk to the same level.
Make sure of getting and rereading (or get someone to translate to you) Kautsky’s Weg zur Macht * —what he wrote there about the revolution of our times!! And what a scoundrel he has become now, renouncing all this! Our job now is a merciless war on chauvinism, covered up by chatter about defence of the “fatherland”, etc.
, especially on the “socialist chauvinism” of Plekhanov, Gues-de, Kautsky (the worst of the lot, the hypocrite!) and Co.
Defending the revolution (bourgeois in Russia and socialist in the West), we preach it in wartime too.
Our watchword is civil war.
It is all purest sophistry that this watchword is unsuitable, etc.
, and so forth.
We cannot “make” it, but we preach it and we work in that direction.
In every country preference should be given to the struggle against the chauvinism of the particular country, to awakening of hatred of one’s own government, to appeals (repeated, * Path to Power.
—Ed.
insistent, numerous, tireless) to the solidarity of the workers of the warring countries, to their joint civil war against the bourgeoisie.
No one will venture to guarantee when and to what extent this preaching will be “justified” in practice: that is not the point (only base sophists renounce revolutionary agita-tion because they don’t know when the revolution will take place).
The point is to work on those lines.
Only that work is socialist, not chauvinist.
And it alone will bear socialist fruit, revolutionary fruit.
The watchword of peace now is absurd and mistaken (especially after the betrayal by almost all the leaders up to and including Guesde, Plekhanov, Vandervelde, Kaut-sky).
In practice it would mean petty-bourgeois moaning.
But we must remain revolutionaries in war conditions too.
And must preach the class struggle among the troops also.
All the best.
Write more often.
Yours, Lenin Written on October 3 1 , 1 9 1 4 Sent from Berne to Stockholm First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany II Printed from the original80 TO THE SECRETARY, EDITORIAL BOARD OF THE GRANAT PUBLISHING HOUSE Berne, November 17, 1914 Dear Colleague, I have sent you today by registered post the article on Marx and Marxism 203 for the dictionary.
It is not for me to judge how far I have succeeded in solving the difficult problem of squeezing the exposition into a framework of about 75,000 letters and spaces.
I will observe that I had to compress the literature very intensively (15,000 was the ultimatum), and I had to select the essence of various ten-dencies (of course, with the majority for Marx).
It was difficult to make up my mind to renounce many quotations from Marx.
In my view, quotations are very important for a dictionary (especially on the most controversial ques-tions of Marxism, which include philosophy and the agrarian problem first and foremost).
Readers of the dictionary should have available all the most important statements by Marx, otherwise the purpose of the dictionary would not be achieved.
That is how it seemed to me.
I don’t know either whether you will be satisfied from the point of view of censorship: if not, perhaps we could manage to agree on the rewording of some passages, having in mind passing the censor.
For my part, without ultimative demands from the editorial board, I could not make up my mind to “correct” a number of quotations and propositions of Marxism for reasons of censorship.
I hope you will be kind enough to let me know immediate-ly (a postcard will do) that you have received the article.
I would ask you particularly to send the fee due to me as soon as possible to Gospodin Mark Timofeyevich Yeliza-roy, 17 Grechesky Prosp.
, Flat 18, Petrograd (sending it to me here in wartime would involve the expense of an exchange operation and would be most inconvenient for me).

On account of the war, my library has been held up in Galicia, 2 0 4 and I could not find some quotations from Marx’s works in the Russian translations.
If you think it necessary, perhaps you could request someone in Moscow to do it? (In my view, it is not.
) Incidentally, I should be very glad if you found it possible to send me a proof of the article, and to let me know whether partial corrections of the proof are possible or not.
If you cannot send the proof, I hope you will be kind enough to send me an off-print.

SHLYAPNIKOV November 28, 1914 Dear Friend, I have had a telegram from Branting 2 0 5 today that “the newspapers confirm the arrest of five deputies”.
2 0 6 I fear that now we cannot doubt the fact of the arrest.
This is terrible.
The government has evidently decided to have its revenge on the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group, and will stick at nothing.
We must be ready for the very worst: falsification of documents, forgeries, planting of “evidence”, false witness, trial behind closed doors, etc.
, etc.
I think that without such methods the government would not succeed in getting a sentence.
Could you not try to find out the names of the six who have been arrested? Is K.
all right? At all events, the work of our Party has now become 100 times more difficult.
And still we shall carry it on! Pravda has trained up thousands of class-conscious workers out of whom, in spite of all difficulties, a new collective of leaders—the Russian C.
C.
of the Party—will be formed.
It is now particularly important that you should remain in Stockholm (or near Stockholm), and put all your energy into establishing contacts with Petersburg.
(Write whether you have received any money as a loan: in my last letter I put in a little note for you about this.
If you have not had any and cannot get any, we shall probably be able to send you something; write in as much detail a possible.

3 Printed from the original84 TO INESSA ARMAND D ear friend! I very much advise you to write the plan of the pam-phlet in as much detail as possible.
211 Otherwise too much is unclear.
One opinion I must express here and now: I advise you to throw out altogether § 3—the “demand (women’s) for freedom of love”.
That is not really a proletarian but a bourgeois demand.
After all, what do you understand by that phrase? What can be understood by it? 1.
Freedom from material (financial) calculations in affairs of love? 2.
The same, from material worries? 3.
From religious prejudices? 4.
From prohibitions by Papa, etc.
? 5.
From the prejudices of “society”? 6.
From the narrow circumstances of one’s environment (peasant or petty-bourgeois or bourgeois intellectual)? 7.
From the fetters of the law, the courts and the police? 8.
From the serious element in love? 9.
From child-birth? 10.
Freedom of adultery? Etc.
I have enumerated many shades (not all, of course).
You have in mind, of course, not nos.
8-10, but either nos.
1-7 or something similar to nos.
1-7.
But then for nos.
1-7 you must choose a different wording, because freedom of love does not express this idea exactly.
And the public, the readers of the pamphlet, will inevi-tably understand by “freedom of love”, in general, some-thing like nos.
8-10, even without your wishing it.
Just because in modern society the most talkative, noisy and “top-prominent” classes understand by “freedom of love” nos.
8-10, just for that very reason this is not a prole-tarian but a bourgeois demand.
For the proletariat nos.
1-2 are the most important, and then nos.
1-7, and those, in fact, are not “freedom of love”.
The thing is not what you subjectively “mean” by this.
The thing is the objective logic of class relations in affairs of love.

—Ed.
85 TO INESSA ARMAND D ear friend! I apologise for my delay in replying: I wanted to do it yesterday, but was prevented, and I had no time to sit down and write.
As regards your plan for the pamphlet, my opinion was that “the demand for freedom of love” was unclear and— independently of your will and your wish (I emphasised this when I said that what mattered was the objective, class relations, and not your subjective wishes)—would, in present social conditions, turn out to be a bourgeois, not a proletarian demand.
You do not agree.
Very well.
Let us look at the thing again.
In order to make the unclear clear, I enumerated approx-imately ten possible (and, in conditions of class discord, inevitable) different interpretations, and in doing so re-marked that interpretations 1-7, in my opinion, would be typical or characteristic of proletarian women, and 8-10 of bourgeois women.
If you are to refute this, you have to show (1) that these interpretations are wrong (and then replace them by others, or indicate which are wrong), or (2) incomplete (then you should add those which are missing), or (3) are not divided into proletarian and bourgeois in that way.
You don’t do either one, or the other, or the third.
You don’t touch on points 1-7 at all.
Does this mean that you admit them, to be true (on the whole)? (What you write about the prostitution of proletarian women and theirdependence: “impossibility of saying no” fully comes under points 1-7.
No difference at all can he detected between us here.
) Nor do you deny that this is a proletarian interpretation.
There remain points 8-10.
These you “don’t quite understand” and “object” to: “I don’t understand how it is possible” (that is what you have written!) “to identify” (!!??) “freedom of love with” point 10 .
.
.
.
So it appears that I am “identifying”, while you have undertaken to refute and demolish me? How so? Bourgeois women understand by freedom of love points 8-10—that is my thesis.
Do you deny this? Will you say what bourgeois ladies understand by freedom of love? You don’t say that.
Do not literature and life really prove that that is just how bourgeois women understand it? They prove it completely! You tacitly admit this.
And if that is so, the point is their class position, and it is hardly possible and almost naïve to “refute” them.
What you must do is separate from them clearly, contrast with them, the proletarian point of view.
One must take into account the objective fact that otherwise they will snatch the appropriate passages from your pamphlet, in-terpret them in their own way, make your pamphlet into water pouring on their mill, distort your ideas in the work-ers’ eyes, “confuse” the workers (sowing in their minds the fear that you may be bringing them alien ideas).
And in their hands are a host of newspapers, etc.
While you, completely forgetting the objective and class point of view, go over to the “offensive” against me, as though I am “identifying” freedom of love with points 8-10.
.
.
.
Marvellous, really marvellous .
.
.
.
“Even a fleeting passion and intimacy” are “more poetic and cleaner” than “kisses without love” of a (vulgar, and shallow) married couple.
That is what you write.
And that is what you intend to write in your pamphlet.
Very good.
Is the contrast logical? Kisses without love between a vulgar couple are dirty.
I agree.
To them one should con-trast .
.
.
what?.
.
.
One would think: kisses with love? Whileyou contrast them with “fleeting” (why fleeting?) “passion” (why not love?)—so, logically, it turns out that kisses without love (fleeting) are contrasted with kisses without love by married people.
.
.
.
Strange.
For a popular pamphlet, would it not he better to contrast philistine-intellectual-peasant (I think they’re in my point 6 or point 5) vulgar and dirty marriage without love to proletarian civil marriage with love (adding, if you absolutely insist, that fleeting intimacy and passion, too, may be dirty and may be clean).
What you have arrived at is, not the contrast of class types, but something like an “incident”, which of course is possible.
But is it a question of particular incidents? If you take the theme of an incident, an individual case of dirty kisses in marriage and pure ones in a fleeting intimacy, that is a theme to be worked out in a novel (because there the whole essence is in the individual circumstances, the analysis of the characters and psychology of particular types).
But in a pamphlet? You understood my idea very well about the unsuitable quotation from Key, 2 1 2 when you said it is “stupid” to appear in the role of “professors of love”.
Quite so.
Well, and what about the role of professors of fleeting, etc.
? Really, I don’t want to engage in polemics at all.
I would willingly throw aside this letter and postpone matters until we can talk about it.
But I want the pamphlet to be a good one, so that no one could tear out of it phrases which would cause you unpleasantness (sometimes one single phrase is enough to be the spoonful of tar in a barrel of honey), could misinterpret you.
I am sure that here, too, you wrote “without wishing it”, and the only reason why I am send-ing you this letter is that you may examine the plan in greater detail as a result of the letters than you would after a talk—and the plan, you know, is a very important thing.
Have you not some French socialist friend? Translate my points 1-10 to her (as though it were from English), together with your remarks about “fleeting”, etc.
, and watch her, listen to her as attentively as possible: a little experi-ment as to what outside people will say, what their impres-sions will be, what they will expect of the pamphlet.
I shake you by the hand, and wish you fewer headaches and to get better soon.

SHLYAPNIKOV February 11 Dear Friend, I have received your two letters, of February 4 and 5.
Many thanks.
As regards sending Sotsial-Demokrat, we have given your letter to the secretary of the dispatch committee to read.
Tomorrow I shall remind him personally, and I hope that they will do everything.
The Parisians promised to send you Plekhanov’s little pamphlet, and we are very surprised that you have not received it.
We shall order it once more, and get one our-selves to send you.
214 The two Plekhanovites of whom you wrote were here.
We chatted with them.
Take notice of the little fair one (they are going back the same way): apparently Plekhanov re-pelled him even more than the little dark one.
The latter, I think, is a hopeless chatterbox.
But the former keeps very quiet, and you can’t find out what is going on in his head.
From Nashe Slovo (which is appearing in Paris in place of Golos) we have had a letter today with a plan for a com-mon protest against “official social-patriotism” (on the subject of the scheme for a London conference of socialists de la Triple Entente 2 1 5 ).
Whether the conference will take place, we don’t know; we had the other day from Litvinov a letter he transmitted from Huysmans, who is planning something strange, calling together the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau on February 20 at The Hague, and on February 20-25 organising in the sameplace personal negotiations (!!) with the delegates from Britain, France and Russia!! Astonishing!! It looks like preparations of some kind for something Francophil and patriotic (by the way, you are absolutely right that there are now many “phils” and few socialists.
For us both Franco-phils and Germanophils are one and the same= patriots, bourgeois or their lackeys, and not socialists.
The Bundists, for example, are for the most part Germanophils and glad of the defeat of Russia.
But in what way are they any better than Plekhanov? Both are opportunists, social-chauvinists, only of different colours.
And Axelrod too).
We have replied to Nashe Slovo that we are glad of their proposal, and have sent them our draft declaration.
* Hopes of an agreement with them are not great, because Axelrod, it is said, is in Paris—and Axelrod (see Nos.
86 and 87 of Golos and No.
37 of Sotsial-Demokrat) is a social-chau-vinist, who wants to reconcile Francophils and Germano-phils on the basis of social-chauvinism.
Let us see what is dearer to Nashe Slovo—anti-chauvinism or the good will of Axelrod.
I think that both in Russia and throughout the world a new basic grouping is coming into existence within Social-Democracy: the chauvinists (“social-patriots”) and their friends, their defenders—and the anti-chauvinists.
In the main, this division corresponds to the division between the opportunists and the revolutionary Social-Democrats.
But it plus précis represents, so to speak, a higher stage of development, nearer to the socialist revolution.
And among us the old grouping (liquidators and Pravdists) is becoming out of date, and being replaced by a new, more sensible division: social-patriots and anti-patriots.
By the way.
They say that Dan 216 =a German “social-patriot”, i.
e.
, a Germano-phil, i.
e.
, for Kautsky.
Is this true? It looks very much like the truth.
It’s an odd thing that in the Organising Committee 217 the split is along bourgeois lines: Francophils (Plekhanov & Alexinsky & Maslov & Nasha Zarya) and Germanophils (Bund&Axelrod&Dan?? etc.
).
If you don’t get any money from the Swedes, let us know: * See “To the Editors of Nashe Slovo” (present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
125-28).
—Ed.
we shall send you 100 francs.
Think over very thoroughly where it is best (i.
e.
, most useful for the cause and safest for you: this is very important: you must protect your-self!!) to lie low, in London or in Norway, etc.
It is of the greatest importance to organise transport, even little by little.
You ought to have an interview with the Plekhanov-ites who in two or three weeks will be in your place, and come to an arrangement about all this.
All the best; I wish you courage and all good things.
Yours, Lenin Sent from Berne to Stockholm First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany II Printed from the original87 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI Dear Comrade, Many thanks for all your trouble and assistance, about which you write in your last letter.
Your articles in Nashe Slovo and for Kommunist 2 1 8 on Scandinavian affairs have raised the following question in my mind: Can one praise and find correct the position of the Left Scandinavian Social-Democrats who reject the arming of the people? I argued about this with Höglund in 1910 and tried to prove to him that this was not Leftism, nor revolu-tionism, but simply the philistinism of petty-bourgeois provincials.
2 1 9 These Scandinavian petty-bourgeois have tucked themselves away in their little countries, almost at the North Pole, and are proud of the fact that you can’t get to them in a month of Sundays! How can one allow that a revolutionary class on the eve of the social revolution should be against the arming of the people? This is not struggle against militarism, but a cowardly attempt to retire from the great questions of the capitalist world.
How can one “recognise ” the class struggle, without under-standing its inevitable transformation at certain moments into civil war? It seems to me that you ought to collect material on this, and come out resolutely against in Kommunist, and then, for the instruction of the Scandinavians, print it afterwards in Swedish, etc.
I should like to know your opinion about this in more detail.
Bruce Glasier, in my belief, is an unsuitable contributor: although he has a proletarian strain in him, still he is an unbearable opportunist.
You will hardly be able to go along with him: he will start crying after two days, and saying that he was “trapped”, that he doesn’t want and doesn’t recognise anything of the kind.
Have you seen the book by David, and his opinion about our manifesto? 220 Is there not in the Scandinavian countries any material on the struggle of the two currents of opinion concerning the attitude to the war? Could not one gather precise material (reactions, assessments, resolutions) with a precise contrasting of facts regarding the tendencies of the two currents? Do facts confirm (in my opinion, they do) that the opportunists-taken as a current of opinion—are, on the whole, > chauvinists than the revolutionary Social-Demo-crats? What do you think, would it not be possible to gather and work up such material for Kommunist? I shake your hand, and wish you all the best, N.

Who is this Shaw Desmond who has been giving a lecture in the Scandinavian countries? Is the text of his lec-ture available in English? Is he a conscious revolutionary, or à la Hervé? Written later than May 2 2 , 1 9 1 5 Sent from Berne to Christiania (Oslo) First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany II Printed from the original88 TO DAVID WIJNKOOP Dear Comrade, The weathercock (Drehscheibe) Kautsky and Co.
want now, with the help of Left phrases and a purely verbal departure from the policy of August 4”, 2 2 1 to “stifle” the revolu-tionary ferment which is beginning.
We are now for peace, these gentlemen will be saying together with Renaudel and Co.
, striving thereby to satisfy the revolutionary masses.
There is talk of a conference of the Lefts—and it is more than likely that dirty little souls of the Bernstein-Kautsky type will make use of such a conference in order, once again, to deceive the masses with the help of “passive radicalism”.
It is quite possible that sensible statesmen of both bellig-erent groups now have nothing against the incipient revo-lutionary ferment being stifled by an idiotic “peace pro-gramme”.
I don’t know whether the German Lefts are already strong enough to upset the manoeuvre of these passive (and hypo-critical) “radicals”.
But you and we are independent parties.
We must do something: work out a programme of revolution, expose the idiotic and hypocritical watchword of peace, denounce and refute it, talk with utter frankness to the workers—in order to tell the truth (without the base diplomacy of the leaders of the Second Inter-national).
And the truth is this: either one supports the revolutionary ferment which is beginning, and assists it (for this one needs the watchword of revolution, of civil war, of illegal organisation, etc.
), or one stifles it (for this one needs the watchword of peace, the “condemnation” of “annexations”, maybe disarmament, etc.
, etc.
).
History will show that it is we who were right, i.
e.
, the revolutionaries in general, not necessarily A or B.
I should like to know whether you (your Party) are able to send your representative (knowing one of the three main languages).
And do you think it possible that both our parties officially (in writing or verbally, better: and ver-bally) should propose a joint declaration (or resolution)? If there are only money difficulties, let us know exactly how much is needed.
Perhaps we will be able to help.
Best greetings.

2 1 , January 2 1 , 1 9 4 9 Printed from the original89 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI Dear Comrade, The question of a conference of the “Left” is going ahead.
There has already been a first Vorkonferenz, 2 2 2 and a second, decisive one, will be held shortly.
It is extremely important to draw in the Left Swedes (Höglund) and the Norwegians.
Be kind enough to write (1) whether we are in agreement with you (or you with the C.
C.
), if not, wherein we differ, and (2) whether you will undertake to draw in the “Left” Scandinavians.
Ad I.
You know our position from Sotsial-Demokrat.
In Russian affairs we shall not be for unity with the Chkheidze group 2 2 3 (which Trotsky, and the O.
C.
, and Plekhanov, and Co.
want: see The War), because this is a cover-up and defence of Nashe Dyelo.
In international affairs we shall not be for rapprochement with Haase-Bernstein-Kautsky (for in practice they want unity with the Südekums and to shield them, they want to get away with Left phrases and to change nothing in the old rotten party).
We cannot stand for the watchword of peace, because we consider it supremely muddled, pacifist, petty-bourgeois, helping the governments (they now want to be with one hand “for peace”, in order to climb out of their difficulties) and obstructing the revolu-tionary struggle.
In our opinion, the Left should make a common decla-ration of principle (1) unquestionably condemning the social-chauvinists and opportunists, (2) giving a programme of revolutionary action (whether to say civil war or revolu-tionary mass action, is not so important), (3) against the watchword of “defence of the fatherland”, etc.
A declara-tion of principle by the “Left”, in the name of several coun-tries, would have a gigantic significance (of course, not in the spirit of the Zetkin philistinism which she got adopted at the Women’s Conference 224 at Berne; Zetkin evaded the question of condemning social-chauvinism!! out of a desire for “peace” with the Südekums&Kautsky??).
If you are not in agreement with these tactics, drop us a line straightaway.
If you are in agreement, do take on the translation of (1) the manifesto of the Central Committee (No.
33 of Sotsial-Demokrat) * and (2) the Berne resolutions (No.
40 of Sotsial-Demokrat) ** into Swedish and Norwegian, and get in touch with Höglund—do they agree to prepare a common declaration (or resolution) on such a basis (naturally we shall not quarrel over details)? Particular speed with this is necessary.
And so I await your reply.

90 TO DAVID WIJNKOOP Dear Comrade Wijnkoop, The scheme with which we are now occupied, the plan for an international declaration of principle by the Marxist Left, is so important that we have no right to delay, and must carry it through successfully to its conclusion, more-over as quickly as possible.
The fact that we are late with it presents a great danger! The article by A.
P.
in Berner Tagwacht (July 24) on the Congress of the S.
D.
P.
of Holland is extremely impor-tant for our mutual understanding.
2 2 5 I welcome with the greatest joy the position taken up by you, Gorter and Ra-vesteyn on the question of a people’s militia (we have that in our programme too).
An exploited class which did not strive to possess arms, to know how to use them and to master the military art would be a class of lackeys.
The defenders of disarmament as against a people’s militia (there are “Lefts” of this kind in Scandinavia too: I argued about this with Höglund in 1910) are taking up the position of petty bour-geois, pacifists, opportunists in the small states.
But for us it is the point of view of the great states and the revolu-tionary struggle (i.
e.
, also of civil war) which must be decisive.
Anarchists may be against a people’s militia, from the point of view of the social revolution (conceived of without relation to time and space).
But our most im-portant task now is to draw a sharp line of demarcation between the Marxist Left on the one hand and the opportun-ists (and Kautskians) and anarchists on the other.
One passage in the article by A.
P.
really revolted me, namely the one where he says that the declaration of prin-ciple by Mme.
Roland-Hoist “completely corresponds to the point of view of the S.
D.
P.
”!! From that declaration of principle, in the form in which it was printed in Berner Tagwacht and in Internationale Korrespondenz, 226 I see that we cannot in any circumstances accept solidarity with Mme.
Roland-Hoist.
Mme.
Roland-Holst, in my opinion, is a Dutch Kautsky or a Dutch Trots-ky.
These people in principle “firmly disagree” with the opportunists, but in practice, on all important questions, they agree!! Mme.
Roland-Holst rejects the principle of defence of the fatherland, i.
e.
, she rejects social-chauvinism.
That is good.
But she does not reject opportunism!! In a most lengthy declaration there is not one word against opportunism! There is not one clear, unambiguous word about revolution-ary means of struggle (but in return, all the more phrases about “idealism”, self-sacrifice, etc.
, which every scoundrel, including Troelstra and Kautsky, can very willingly ac-cept)! Not one word about a rupture with the opportunists! The watchword of “peace” is quite à la Kautsky! Instead of this (and quite consistently, from the point of view of the unprincipled “declaration of principle” of Mme.
Ro-land-Holst) the advice to co-operate both with the S.
D.
P.
and the S.
D.
L.
P.
!! This means unity with the opportunists.
Quite like our Mr.
Trotsky: “in principle firmly against defence of the fatherland”, in practice for unity with the Chkheidze group in the Russian Duma (i.
e.
, with the oppo-nents of our group which has been exiled to Siberia, with the best friends of the Russian social-chauvinists).
No.
No.
Never and in no circumstances shall we agree in principle with the declaration of Mme.
Roland-Holst.
It is a quite thoughtless, purely platonic and hypocritical internationalism.
Just one long compromise.
It is suited (speaking politically) only to the task of forming a “Left wing” (i.
e.
, a “harmless minority”, a “decorative Marxist signboard”) in the old, rotten and scoundrelly lackey parties (the Liberal Labour parties).
Of course, we do not demand an immediate split in this or that party, for example, in Sweden, Germany or France.
It is very possible that the time for this will be more favour-able (for example, in Germany) somewhat later.
But in principle we must unquestionably demand a complete break with opportunism.
The whole struggle of our Party (and of the working-class movement in Europe generally) must be directed against opportunism.
The latter is not a current of opinion, not a tendency; it (opportunism) has now become the organised tool of the bourgeoisie within the working-class movement.
And furthermore: questions of the revolu-tionary struggle (tactics, means, propaganda in the army, fraternisation in the trenches, etc.
) must undoubtedly be analysed in detail, discussed, thought out, tested, ex-plained to the masses in the illegal press.
Without this any “recognition” of revolution remains only an empty phrase.
We have no common road with phrase-mongering (in Dutch: “passive”) radicals.
I hope, dear Comrade Wijnkoop, that you will not take offence at these remarks of mine.
After all, we must come to a proper agreement, in order to carry on jointly this difficult struggle.
Please show this letter to Comrade Pannekoek and other Dutch friends.
Yours, N.
Lenin P.
S.
I will shortly send you the official resolution of our Party (of 1913) on the question of the right of all nations to self-determination.
2 2 7 We are for this.
Now, in the struggle against the social-chauvinists, we must be more for this than ever before.

2 1 , January 2 1 , 1 9 4 9 Printed from the original91 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI Dear A.
M.
, We are sending you the money tomorrow.
Many thanks for the news from Russia.
In principle we have nothing against an agreement; we hope that you will be extra careful.
As regards armament of the people versus disarmament, it seems to me all the same that we cannot alter the pro-gramme.
228 If the words about the class struggle are not an empty phrase in the liberal sense (as they have become with the opportunists, Kautsky and Plekhanov), how can one object to a fact of history—the transformation of this struggle, under certain conditions, into civil war? How moreover can an oppressed class in general be against the armament of the people? To reject this means to fall into a semi-anarchist attitude to imperialism—in my belief, this can be seen in certain Left-wingers even among ourselves.
Once there is imperial-ism, they say, then we don’t need either self-determination of nations or the armament of the people! That is a crying error.
It is precisely for the socialist revolution against im-perialism that we need both one and the other.
Is it “realisable”? Such a criterion is incorrect.
Without revolution almost the entire minimum programme is un-realisable.
Put in that way, realisability declines into philistinism.
It seems to me that this question (like all questions of Social-Democratic tactics today) can be put only in connec-tion with the evaluation of (and reckoning with) opportunism.
And it is clear that “disarmament”, as a tactical watchword,is opportunism.
Moreover it is a provincial one, it stinks of a little state, detachment from the struggle, poverty of ideas: “it’s no business of mine”.

92 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI Dear A.
M.
, We were very glad about the statement by the Norwegians and your efforts with the Swedes.
229 It would be devilishly important to have a joint international statement by the Left Marxists! (A statement of principle is the main thing, and so far the only thing possible.
) Roland-Hoist, like Rakovsky (have you seen his French pamphlet?), like Trotsky, in my opinion, are all the most harmful “Kautskians”, in the sense that all of them in various forms are for unity with the opportunists, all in various forms embellish opportunism, all of them (in various ways) preach eclecticism instead of revolutionary Marxism.
I think your criticism of the draft declaration does not show (unless I am mistaken) any serious differences between us.
I think it mistaken in theory and harmful in practice not to distinguish types of wars.
We cannot be against wars of national liberation.
You quote the example of Ser-bia.
But if the Serbs were alone against Austria, would we not be for the Serbs? The essence of the thing today is the struggle between the Great Powers for the redivision of the colonies and the subjugation of the smaller powers.
A war of India, Persia, China and so forth with Britain or Russia? Would we not be for India against Britain, etc.
? To call that “a civil war” is inexact, an obvious exaggera-tion.
It is extremely harmful to stretch the conception of civil war beyond measure, because that blurs the essence of the question: a war of hired workers against the capitalists of a particular state.
It is the Scandinavians, apparently, who are falling into a petty-bourgeois (and provincial, kleinstaatisch) pacifism, repudiating “war” in general.
That is not Marxist.
One has to combat this, like their rejection of the militia.
Once again greetings, and congratulations on the Norwegian declaration! Yours, Lenin Written not earlier than August 4 , 1 9 1 5 Sent from Sörenberg (Switzerland) to Christiania (Oslo) First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany II Printed from the original93 TO K.

RADEK Dear Comrade Radek, I return your draft.
230 Not a word about social-chauvin-ism and (= ) opportunism and the struggle against them!! Why such an embellishing of the evil and concealment from the working masses of their main enemy in the Social-Democratic parties? Will you make an ultimatum of insisting that not a word should be said openly about a ruthless struggle against opportunism? I hope to arrive two days earlier (i.
e.
, September 2-3) if you inform me that the Germans will also come earlier (otherwise Zinoviev will come alone).
(Your draft is too “academic”, not a militant appeal, not a fighting manifesto.
) Will you be sending your draft to Wijnkoop? Are you insisting that they (the Dutch) should come? Please send me at once the (German) translation of my draft (about which you wrote to Wijnkoop) and the transla-tion of our resolution of 1913 (the nationalities question).
That makes two things.
We must make every effort to publish our pamphlet (in German) before September 5.
I am writing today to Kaspa-rov that he should help you and find another translator (in Berne—Comrade Kinkel).
Can you (with Kasparov) work at “extra speed” and translate this pamphlet in the course of a week? And what about the printing? Can it beprinted in three or four days? We must make every effort and do this! I beg you to reply immediately.

SHLYAPNIKOV August 23, 1915 Dear Alexander, As regards the plan of your journey, it is very hard for me to give you definite advice from so far off.
231 Our finan-cial affairs are known to you.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna has written to you in detail (in addition to what was sent, 600 francs were promised before October 10&400 francs one month later.
In all, 1,000 francs.
For the time being there is no hope of more).
On the one hand, extreme care is essential.
Have you completely reliable papers? And all the rest? On the other hand, it would be unquestionably useful for the cause just now, if a fully-informed and independent person travelled round two or three centres, made contacts, established relations and immediately returned to Sweden, to pass on all the contacts to us and to discuss the further situation.
This would be most important.
Kommunist No.
1 will appear in 8-10 days; then, after as many more, No.
2 (or Nos.
1-2 together).
No.
44 of the Central Organ will appear in a day or two.
A pamphlet about the war with all documents will come out in a fort-night.
It is already being set.
Events in Russia have completely endorsed our position, which the social-patriot donkeys (from Alexinsky to Chkheid-ze) have christened defeatism.
The facts have proved that we are right!! The military reverses are helping to shake the foundations of tsarism, and facilitating an alliance of the revolutionary workers of Russia and other countries.
Peo-ple say: what will “you” do, if “you”, the revolutionaries, defeat tsarism? I reply: (1) our victory will fan the flames of the “Left” movement in Germany a hundredfold; (2) if “we” defeated tsarism completely, we would propose peace to all the belligerent powers on democratic terms and, if this were rejected, we would conduct a revolutionary war.
It is clear that the advanced section of Pravdist workers, that bulwark of our Party, has survived, in spite of terrible devastations in its ranks.
It would be extremely important for leading groups to come together in two or three centres (most conspiratively), establish contact with us, restore a Bureau of the Central Committee (one exists, I think, in Petersburg already) and the C.
C.
itself in Russia.
They should establish firm ties with us (if necessary, one or two persons should be brought to Sweden for this purpose).
We would send news-sheets, leaflets, etc.
The most important thing is firm and constant relations.
Chkheidze and Co.
are obviously shuffling: they are true friends of Nashe Dyelo, Alexinsky is pleased with them (I hope you have seen The War by Plekhanov&Alexinsky&Co.
There’s a disgrace!!) and yet they “play” at Leftism with the help of Trotsky!! I don’t think they will succeed in de-ceiving the class-conscious Pravdists.
Write what you decide.

SHLYAPNIKOV Für Alexander Dear Friend, Try and see Belenin and tell him, please, that he has been co-opted a member of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
You understand, of course, that the maximum secrecy must be observed in this matter, and that you must “forget” about it after passing on the in-formation to Belenin (I am not writing to him direct for obvious reasons).
His function during the journey is very im-portant: Trotsky and the company of lackeys of opportunism abroad are straining every effort to “gloss over” the differ-ences, and “save” the opportunism of Nasha Zarya, by white-washing and lauding the Chkheidze group (=the most faith-ful friends of Nasha Zarya).
It is necessary to set up groups in Russia (of old, experienced, sensible Pravdist workers who have fully mastered the question of the war) and take the best of them (2-3) into the C.
C.
If there are difficulties, or if doubts arise, then he could limit himself to setting up analogous bodies (for example, “the leading All-Russia Workers’ Group” or “Committee”, etc.
; it’s not the name that counts, of course).
Your connections and your knowledge of old and experi-enced workers will help you to give advice to Belenin, who, of course, will treat this work with exceptional seriousness and caution.
And the most important thing is that he should now be extremely careful, making a short trip and bringing back all the contacts.
Best greetings! Drop me a line directly you receive this letter.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
The pamphlet will appear earlier than I thought.
I have already received part of the proofs.
Probably in a week or ten days we shall have both the pamphlet and No.

SHLYAPNIKOV October 10, 1915 Dear Friend, Tomorrow we are publishing two issues of the Central Organ at the same time—No.
45-46 (devoted to the Zimmer-wald Conference) and No.
47, containing news from Russia and the “theses” on tactics.
* These theses consist partly of replies to the questions which we touched on in our cor-respondence, and you in your talks with N.
I.
, etc.
I shall await your comments.
Have you received the Russian text of the pamphlet Social-ism and War? (In parenthesis: A.
M.
has sent in a criticism of the Ger-man text, and I replied to her in a detailed letter to America.
If you are interested, ask her to send it to you.
About her leaflet I wrote to her at Bergen, asking permission to make corrections.
There is no reply.
I am afraid I shall have to write to America, and that means a big delay.
) News from Russia testifies to the growing revolution-ary mood and movement, though to all appearances this is not yet the beginning of revolution.
The most important thing for us now is to establish con-tacts and make them regular (this is quite possible by cor-respondence; consider whether one copy of the paper and manifestos cannot be sent in a thin binding).
Let us hope that Belenin will succeed in organising this.
Otherwise one cannot dream of any systematic, connected work.
* Reference is to Lenin’s article “Several Theses” (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
401-04).
—Ed.
Pay special attention to the thesis about the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies.
One must be careful with this thing: 200 or 300 leaders might be arrested!! Except in connection with an insurrection, the “strength” of a Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is an illusion.
One should not give way to it.
All the best.
Yours, Lenin Could not one organise the transcribing of such articles in the Central Organ as “Eleven Theses” in chemical ink, for rapid delivery to Petersburg? Think it over well.
Sent from Berne to Stockholm First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany II Printed from the original97 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI November 9, 1915 Dear A.
M.
, Only yesterday did we get your letter of October 18 from Milwaukee.
Letters take a terribly long time! You have not yet received my letter (and Nos.
45-46 and 47 of Sotsial-Demokrat) about Zimmerwald, and containing all the rep-lies to your questions; yet that letter was written more than a month ago.
Try at any rate to calculate where you will be (approximately, in six weeks’ time) and give us addresses (for letters to you), so that they arrive nearer.
As regards the New York Volkszeitung, Grimm assured me today that they are quite Kautskian! Is that the case? I think our German pamphlet * might help you to determine the “strength” of their internationalism.
Have you had it? (500 copies were sent to you.
) In a few days we are publishing here (in German, and then we hope to put it out in French and, if we can manage the money, in Italian) a little pamphlet on behalf of the Zimmer-wald Left.
Under this name we should like to launch into in-ternational circulation, as widely as possible, our Left group at Zimmerwald (the C.
C.
&the Polish Social-Democrats & the Letts & the Swedes & the Norwegians & 1 German & 1 Swiss) with its draft resolution and manifesto (printed in No.
45-46 of Sotsial-Demokrat).
The little pamphlet (20-30-35 thousand letters and spaces) will contain these two docu-ments and a small introduction.
232 We rely on you to pub-lish it in America in English too (for it is hopeless to do this * Reference is to the pamphlet Socialism and War (The Attitude of the R.

L.
P.
towards the War) (see present edition, Vol.

—Ed.
in England: it has to be brought there from America) and, if possible, in other languages.
This is to be the first publica-tion by the nucleus of Left Social-Democrats of all countries, who have a clear, exact and full reply to the question of what is to be done and in which direction to go.
It would be most important if you could succeed in publishing this in America, circulating it as widely as possible and establish-ing firm publishing links (Charles Kerr (N.
B.
) at Chicago;-the Appeal to Reason * at Kansas, etc.
), for it is generally most important for us to come out in various languages (you could do a great deal in this respect).
As regards money, I see with distress from your letter that so far you have not managed to collect anything for the Central Committee.
Perhaps this “Manifesto of the Left” will help.
.
.
.
I never doubted that Hillquit would be for Kautsky and even to the right of him, because I saw him at Stuttgart (1907) and heard how afterwards he defended the prohibition against bringing yellow people into America (an “internationalist”).
.
.
.
The Zimmerwald Manifesto itself is inadequate; Kautsky and Co.
are ready to put up with it, on condition that there is “not a step further”.
We don’t accept this, because it is com-plete hypocrisy.
So that if there are people in America who are afraid even of the Zimmerwald Manifesto, you can brush them aside, and bring in only those who are more Left than the Zimmerwald Manifesto.
I shake you by the hand and wish you every success! Yours, (Ulianow.

QQV 98 TO MAXIM GORKY January 11, 1916 Dear Alexei Maximovich, I am sending you at the Letopis address, not for Letopis but for the publishing house, the manuscript of a pamphlet and request you to publish it.
233 I have tried in as popular a form as possible to set forth new data about America which, I am convinced, are partic-ularly suitable for popularising Marxism and substan-tiating it by means of facts.
I hope I have succeeded in set-ting out these important data clearly and comprehen-sibly for the new sections of the reading public which are multiplying in Russia and need an explanation of the world’s economic evolution.
I should like to continue, and subsequently also to publish, a second part—about Germany.
I am setting to work on a pamphlet about imperialism.
* Owing to war-time conditions I am in extreme need of earnings, and would therefore ask, if it is possible and will not embarrass you too much, to speed up publication of the pamphlet.
Yours with respect, V.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Friend, As regards your letter and its mention of the current reproach that I am “uncompromising”, I should like to discuss the subject with you in greater detail.
As regards James, he never understood politics and was always against the split.
James is a wonderful person, but on these subjects his judgements are profoundly wrong.
In Russia (and now in the new International too) the ques-tion of a split is the basic one.
Any compromise here would be a crime.
I know well how many good people (James, Galyorka, the Petrograd “friends” among the intellectuals) were against the split in the Duma group.
All of them were 1,000 times wrong.
The split was essential.
And the split with Chkheidze and Co.
now, too, is absolutely essential.
All who waver on this subject are enemies of the proletariat, and we must be uncompromising with them.
But who is wavering? Not only Trotsky and Co.
but also Yuri&Eug.
B.
(as late as last summer they were “creating scenes” on account of Chkheidze!!).
Then the Poles (the opposition).
In their Gazeta Robotnicza No.
25, there is their resolution: once again for manoeuvring, as in Brussels on July 3 (16), 1914.
With them an uncompromising attitude is obligatory.
Radek is the best of them; it was useful to work with him (for the Zimmerwald Left as well, by the way), and we did work.
But Radek is also wavering.
And our tactics here are two-sided (this Yuri&Nik.
Iv.
absolutely could not or would not understand): on the one hand, to help Radek to moveleft, to unite all who could be united for the Zimmerwald Left.
On the other hand, not to allow one iota of wavering on the basic issue.
The basic issue is the break with the O.
C.
, with Chkheidze and Co.
The Poles are wavering, and published a most black-guardly resolution after No.
1 of Kommunist.
The conclusion? Either to hang on to the title of Kommunist, and open the door to squabbling and wavering, to letters to the editor (from Radek, Bronski, perhaps Pannekoek and others), complaints, whining, gossip, etc.
Not on any account.
This would be harmful to the cause.
It means helping the scoundrels of the O.
C.
, Chkheidze and Co.
Not on any account.
Kommunist was a temporary bloc to achieve a definite object.
The object has been achieved: the journal was pub-lished, the rapprochement attained (then it was possible, before Zimmerwald).
Now we have to go by another road, to go further.
Kommunist has become harmful.
It has to be stopped, and replaced by a different title: Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata (edited by the editorial board of “Sotsial-Demokrat”).
234 Only in this way will we avoid squabbling, avoid waver-ing.
In Russia, is there also discord? Oh, of course! But it is not our business to increase it.
Let Chkheidze and Co.
, Trots-ky and Co.
busy themselves with increasing the discord (that is their “profession”).
Our job is to pursue our own line.
The fruits of such work are manifest: the Petrograd workers are 100 times better than the Petrograd intellectuals (even the “sympathisers”.
.
.
).
We had to make temporary concessions to the “trio” (Yuri &Eug.
Bosh&Nik.
Iv.
), because at that time it was impossi-ble to bring out the journal otherwise (now it is possible); and the main thing was that we had not yet seen Eug.
Bosh& Yuri at work, and could hope that the work would lead them upwards.
But they went downwards.
And the temporary alliance must be dissolved.
Only in that way will the cause not suffer.
Only in that way will they too learn.
For we are not against discussion.
We are against editorial rights for those who displayed unforgivable vacillation (per-haps owing to their youth? then we shall wait: perhaps in five years’ time they will straighten themselves out).
Nik.
Iv.
is an economist who studies seriously, and in this we have always supported him.
But he is (1) credulous where gossip is concerned and (2) devilishly unstable in politics.
The war pushed him towards semi-anarchist ideas.
At the conference which adopted the Berne resolutions (the spring of 1915) 235 he produced theses (I have them!) which were the height of stupidity, a disgrace, semi-anarchism.
I attacked sharply.
Yuri and Eug.
Bosh listened and remained satisfied that I did not allow any falling away to the left (they declared at the time their complete disagree-ment with N.
Iv.
).
Six months passed.
Nik.
Iv.
studies economics.
He doesn’t occupy himself with politics.
And lo and behold, on the question of self-determination, he serves us up the same nonsense.
Eug.
Bosh&Yuri sign it!! (Take their “theses” from N.
Iv.
, and my reply to him.
2 3 6 ) Yet the question is an important one.
It is an essential question.
It is inextricably bound up with the question of annexations—a most topical question.
They didn’t think it out.
They didn’t read.
They didn’t study.
They listened two or three times to Radek (he has the old “ Polish” disease: he is confused on this)—and signed.
That is a scandal.
It is a disgrace.
These are not editors.
We must refute such people, expose them, give them time to study and think, and be in no hurry to humour them: “Here are editorial rights for you, distribute your nonsense among the workers!!” If that is allowed, they will bring matters to polemics in the press—and then I will be obliged to call them “imperial-ist Economists”, and demonstrate their complete emptiness, the completely unserious and unthought-out character of their ideas.
Polemics in the press will drive them away for years.
But if we stop Kommunist now, they will think it over and drop their nonsense: they will read and become convinced.
Come on, dear friends, write a serious pamphlet, if you proclaim that you have “differences” on policy (which you have never studied or worked on), let’s have it! They will think it over, and not produce it.
And in a few months they will be “cured”.
That’s how it has been in the past.
So t will be in the future.
On the question of annexations (and of self-determin-ation) our position (the resolution of 1913) * has been com-pletely confirmed by the war.
And this question has become a topical one.
While Radek& the Dutchmen (Gorter and Pannekoek) have obviously got muddled on this.
In Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata we shall explain this affair again and again.
We must conduct matters so as to: (1) stop Kommunist; (2) in publishing the miscellany about the Jews, 2 3 7 give Yuri& Eug.
Bosh as much humouring, rights and privileges as possible (it won’t harm the cause in this case).
Detailed conditions in a written agreement; (3) the same as regards their transport group (take their regulations and our amendments to them); (4) publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata under the editor-ship of the editorial board of Sotsial-Demokrat.
We shall invite them to contribute.
We shall say to them: you have differences? Prepare a serious pamphlet! We shall undertake to print it.
(They won’t write it, because they haven’t even begun to think seriously about the question; they haven’t even studied it!!) Now that will be a business-like policy.
Eug.
Bosh has long been intending to go to Russia.
There she could be useful.
Here she has nothing to do, and she will invent something to do.
Do you know that affliction of life abroad: “inventing” things to do for people stranded abroad? A terrible afflic-tion.

ZINOVIEV May 21, 1916 Dear Grigory, I don’t want to turn our correspondence into an alterca-tion.
The question is a serious one and, although I have dis-cussed it more than once, I will repeat my views since it is a necessity.
After more than six mouths’ work with the “publishers” (from Kiev) and several months of thinking over this experience from every point of view, the editorial hoard of the Central Organ sent them in the winter of 1915 a letter which you also signed.
In this letter the editorial board stated that it was giving up participation in Kommunist, on account of a number of considerations which were set forth in exceptional detail, took up a great deal of space in our letter, and amounted to this: that we could not assume Party responsibility for such co-editors, that their attitude to the cause was a non-Party one, and that we must regard the temporary attempt to reach understanding as unsuccess-ful.
We decided to publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
Then you began to have hesitations, which led to our last talk at Kienthal.
I made a concession to you by agreeing to an attempt to restore relations, on the condition that (1) there should be an agreement between the editorial board of the Central Organ and the publishers for each issue; (2) they should give up their group position of an “imperial-ist Economic ” character, their “playing” on the differences with Radek, etc.
These conditions were not written down, and you now dispute them.
But that dispute has become unimpor-tant, since you yourself have set forth in writing, in your draft letter to A.
, your conditions, and the publishers have not accepted even these! (and you had been assuring me that the question was settled, that they would not insist on equal rights!).
The fact is, consequently, that if, even after our meeting at Kienthal, one were to accept your “interpretation”, i.
e.
, that I had laid down more extensive conditions than you, even so, your lesser conditions have also been rejected by the publishers.
It is obvious that your direct and unquestionable duty after this was to attack the publishers with all your strength, to break with them for good, and to use every effort to prove to Alexander that it was impossible to have any dealings with these gentry as editors of a leading journal.
Instead of this you propose to surrender to them, to re-nounce all conditions and to withdraw the letter written by the editorial board of the Central Organ which you your-self signed! And this on the pretext that “they should not be taken seriously”.
In reality, what you are proposing is that your policy should not be taken seriously.
You reduce the letter from the editorial board to devil knows what, abjure your own point of view and give the right to the publishers to draw the conclusion that the editorial board of the Central Organ was merely throwing its weight about! These are no longer hesitations, these are hesitations cubed, which are turning into something much worse.
It remains for me only to repeat for the last time why I don’t enter Kommunist, why I consider it anti-Party and harmful, why I maintain the position of the letter from the editorial board of the Central Organ breaking with the publishers.
We concluded a temporary “federation” with the pub-lishers, and called it a “federation” in so many words, quite definitely making a reservation about its temporary charac-ter, “as an experiment”.
When we concluded this temporary alliance, the publishers were opposing the wobblings of Bu-kharin (at the Conference in Berne in March 1915), and there was not a single fact pointing to any rapprochement of this group of three (the publishers &Bukharin) with special views of their own.
But after the very first number of the journal they did come together in this way, and when, after a long prelim-inary correspondence, I called their trend “imperialist Economism”, you wrote to me that you agreed.
This was in March 1916.
It confirmed once more the most detailed letter from the editorial board of the Central Organ written during the winter.
The Party—and international—situation now is such that the Central Committee must continue to go ahead indepen-dently, not tying its hands either in Russian or in internation-al affairs.
The “publishers”, good for nothing as writers and as politicians (which the editorial board of the Central Organ was obliged to recognise in its winter letter), want to tie us down with an agreement about equal rights, i.
e.
, we must agree to grant equal rights to a lady who hasn’t written a single line and doesn’t understand a single thing, and to a “young man” who is entirely under her influence.
And they will make use of this equality to play on our differences with Radek, with Bukharin and others! It is simply madness to agree to equal rights on such conditions, it means ruining all the work.
It is not true that they want “only a discussion”.
They have every opportunity for a discussion.
They have money.
Nearly a year has gone by.
Why don’t they write, why don’t they publish discussion pamphlets? Because they don’t want to take responsibility themselves! That is clear.
And it is this that constitutes their mockery of Party prin-ciples, because anyone who proclaims that he has differences must think out his case, come forward openly, face his res-ponsibility, and not “play” and not aspire to “equality” when the Party does not even know the position they take up (and when they have no position).
It is a fact that Bukharin stumbles at every step into the views which he set forth in writing in March 1915 (at the Conference), and which you also rejected.
You admitted this fact by agreeing in March 1916 (a year later) with my assess-ment of “imperialist Economism ” .
By granting “equality”, you grant equality in face of the Party to the wobblings of Bukharin! You tie our hands and encourage these wobblings.
That is an insane policy.
You know that Radek, in the first place, was so “offend-ed” (at our insistence on the printing of our theses in Pan-nekoek’s journal 238 ) that—as you yourself wrote to me in March 1916—he carries on “no team work” with you! And the differences with him have not disappeared; on the con-trary, you yourself agreed with me that his estimate of the Irish insurrection was a philistine one.
And you propose to give “equality” to publishers who hide behind Radek, playing (for 2,000 francs!) on our differences with him!! This is an insane policy.
Secondly, Radek is one thing and the editorial board of his paper (Gazeta Robotnicza) is another.
That this paper has also started a game (using the Chkheidze group, Trotsky, etc.
) you yourself have admitted.
Remember that this paper appeared in February 1916, and that the letter of the Committee of Organisations Abroad * against it was worked out with your participation.
Well then, is it serious politics if we now in our leading journal grant “equality” to people who want to make their career by “utilising” our struggle with the Poles, who betrayed us to Vandervelde and Kautsky on July 3 (16), 1914?? Thirdly, you know that at Kienthal Radek wanted to build up a majority against us among the Left, at the meet-ing of the Left, making use of Fröhlich, the Robmann wom-an, etc.
, and that an ultimatum was required to force him to recognise the independence of our Central Committee.
What new “game” will these people make of this when the question arises of the attitude to Junius (the question has already arisen), or of a “mechanical separation” from the Kautskians and others! Do you guarantee that there will be none?? If you do, this would amount on your part to renouncing all our policy.
If you don’t, then it is insane to tie our hands after this in the editorial board of our leading journal.
In no circumstances do I accept this insane policy.
This is my final decision.
I continue to think that only the publi-cation of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata disentangles the affair (which you want to put in a hopeless tangle).
Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata groups around us a number of most useful workers (Varin, Safarov, the Letts, etc.
), detaches Bukharin * See present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
157-60.
—Ed.
from the publishers to us, enables us to lead the Party (and the international Left) and not to march at the tall of Madam Publisher.
Write to me precisely what your decision is.
Formally the matters now stand in this way, that the editorial board of the Central Organ has broken with Kommunist, and its final attempt (even your lesser conditions) has been rejected.
That means that we must announce in print that Kommunist has stopped, and that Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata is going to appear.
I shake your hand and send you salut.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear A.
, Evidently there has been an interruption in our corres-pondence, and quite a number of misunderstandings have been caused by your not receiving our second letter sent to Stock-holm.
Otherwise I cannot understand how you can write that we don’t answer your questions.
We replied to every-thing in the greatest detail; it was you who didn’t reply to us.
N.
K.
is writing very often; we will have to be patient and repeat some things in order to achieve results.
It is essential to maintain regular correspondence.
About Kommunist you write to me that the split with Chkheidze arouses no doubts.
In whom? In Bukharin and Co.
! But what I wrote was that this relates not to Bukharin and Co.
but to Radek and Co.
Kommunist was our temporary bloc with two groups or elements—(1) Bukharin and Co.
, (2) Radek and Co.
While it was possible to march together with them, this was the right thing to do.
Now it is not—and we must temporarily part or, more correctly, move away.
The Poles adopted in the summer of 1915 (after No.
1-2 of Kommunist) and printed only in 1916 a resolation which once again showed their wobblings on the question of Chkheid-ze.
Is it reasonable now to afford them the possibility and right (they are, after all, staff members of Kommunist!!) to muscle in and spoil the journal with their squabbling?? In my belief, it is not reasonable.
It is much more useful for the cause to take another title (Sbornik Sotsial-Demok-rata) and wait a while, until the Poles have learned better (or until they come under Germany) or until the situation changes.
Further.
About Bukharin and Co.
I will certainly send you (though not very soon, because it depends on a journey to Berne) Bukharin’s “theses” of the spring of 1915.
Then you will see what it is all about: 1) In the spring of 1915 Bukharin (at the Conference!) writes theses in which he is visibly rolling down into the swamp.
The Japanese 239 are against him.
(Therefore we temporarily accept the maximum of concessions in Kommun-ist, in order to create a form convenient for clearing up the affair: shall we succeed in overcoming Bukharin’s waver-ings “in comradely fashion”? will E.
B.
, who calls herself a Bolshevik, help in this or not?) 2) In the summer of 1915 (or approaching the autumn) Bukharin& the Japanese, now as a group of three, sign the theses about self-determination.
Utterly wrong, in our opinion, and a repetition of Bukharin’s mistakes.
3) At the beginning of 1916 Bukharin on the question of the “Dutch Programme” (from No.
3 of the Bulletin of the I.
S.
C) again returns to the ideas of his spring theses of 1915!!! The conclusion? A bloc is impossible in this case also.
We must wait until Bukharin’s waverings have ceased.
A journal which would be an organ of Polish-Bukharin waver-ings would be harmful.
It would be harmful in such a situa-tion to cling to the old title, and not to be capable of selecting another (Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata).
The non-Party and dishonest behaviour of the Japanese lies in this, that they want to throw the responsibility for their wobblings on us.
Excuse us, kind friends, we shall not allow you to do this! If you want to be Party people, you will help us partly in money to publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, where we (after all, we are not wobbling) will analyse your mistakes in comradely fashion without naming you, not giving the enemy the chance to rejoice and gloat.
Moreover, if the Japanese took seriously the most serious question of differences (abroad il n’y a qu’un pas * to a separate faction!! You can believe me, I’ve been seeing this happen for about 20 years!!), they would force themselves to study the difference, think it over, work at it (they did * There is but one step.
—Ed.
not think and did not study, but simply blurted out the first thing that came into their heads).
They would have given a full statement of their differences, either in a manu-script for an intimate circle of leading comrades (who could have helped in not giving publicity to the question in the press), or in a pamphlet if they wanted to “go into print” (they’ve got the money).
Then they themselves would be answering for their “ideas”.
That is essential.
If you want to teach the workers new truths —answer for them, and don’t throw responsibility on us, don’t hide behind us (we are nobodies, let Lenin and Co.
answer to the Party for the “discussion”, i.
e.
, for the gloat-ing of our enemies).
No, kind friends!! That won’t wash!! I am not going to answer for your wobblings.
We shall publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata even without your help, Messrs.
Japanese.
We shall grant you a postponement: think it over, clear up your ideas, decide finally whether you want to assume res-ponsibility for a new muddle or not.
If all you want is to “match” us against the Poles and the Dutch in the Russian press, that we won’t allow you to do.
This is the situation, these are my views; and I repeat that I will certainly send you Bukharin’s spring theses, so that you can judge the whole situation according to the docu-ments.
N.
K.
is writing today about self-determination.
We are not for fragmentation.
But what about the question of annexations? Bukharin and Co.
(just like Radek with Rosa Luxemburg and Pannekoek) have not thought over what it means to be “against old and new annexations” (the for-mula in the press drawn up by Radek)?? Why, that is “self-determination of nations”, only expressed in other words! Well, so long until next time.

All the material, the plan and the greater part of the work were already completed on the plan as ordered, 5 sig-natures (200 manuscript pages), so that to cut it down once more to 3 signatures was absolutely impossible.
It will be terribly disappointing if they don’t publish it! Wouldn’t it be possible at least to get it printed in the journal of the same publisher? 241 ” Unfortunately, for some reason my correspondence with him has lapsed.

As regards the name of the author, I would, of course, prefer my usual pseudonym.
If that is inconvenient, I suggest another: N.

Or if you want to, take any other.
As regards the notes, I would earnestly ask you to retain them; you will see from No.
101 that they are exceptionally important for me.
And then in Russia the students, etc.
, are also readers: they need to have the literature indicated to them.
I deliberately selected a most economical system (in the sense of space and paper).
Using small type, 7 manuscript pages mean something like two pages of print.
I particularly ask you to leave in the notes, or to appeal to the publisher to leave them.
As regards the title: if the one given is inconvenient, if it is desir-able to avoid the word imperialism, then put in: “The Basic Peculiarities of Contemporary Capitalism.

subheading, “A Popular Outline”, is unquestionably necessary, because a number of important matters are set forth in that style.
) The first sheet with a list of chapters, some of which have headings that are perhaps not quite convenient from the point of view of the restrictions, I am sending for you.
If you find it more convenient and safer, retain it and don’t send it further.
Altogether it would be very pleas-ant if both could be printed in the journal of the same publish-er.

ZINOVIEV Bukharin’s article is beyond question unsuitable.
242 There is not any shadow of a “theory of the imperialist state”.
There is a summary of data about the growth of state capi-talism, and nothing else.
To fill an illegal journal with this most legal material would be absurd.
It must be rejected (with supreme politeness, promising every assistance in getting it published legally).
* But perhaps we had better wait for Yuri’s article, and not write to Bukharin for the time being.
We should wait, too, with the letter to Bukharin about their “faction”, otherwise he will think that we have rejected it out of “factionalism”.
To pose the question of the “epoch” and the “present war”, as though they were “extremes”, is just what is meant by falling into eclecticism.
Just as though our aim were to strike the “happy mean” between “extremes”!!! The problem is to give a correct definition of the relation-ship of the epoch to the present war.
This has been done both in the resolutions and in my articles: “the present im-perialist war is not an exception, but a typical phenomenon in the imperialist epoch.
” The typical is not the unique.
One cannot understand the present war without under-standing the epoch.
When people say this about the epoch, this is not just a phrase.
It is correct.
And your quotations from my old articles say only that.
They are correct.
* Privately, in my own name, I will advise Bukharin to change the title and retain only the economic part.
For the political part is quite incomplete, not thought out, useless.
But when people draw from this the conclusion, as they have begun to do, that “in the epoch of imperialism there cannot be national wars”, that is nonsense.
It is an obvious error—historical and political and logical (for an epoch is a sum of varied phenomena, in which in addition to the typi-cal there is always something else).
And you repeat this error, when you write in your re-marks: “Small countries cannot in the present epoch defend their fatherland.
” [=the vulgarisers] Untrue!! This is just the error of Junius, Radek, the “disarmers” and the Japanese!! One should say: “Small countries, too, cannot in imperial-ist wars, which are most typical of the current imperialist epoch, defend their fatherland.
” That is quite different.
In this difference lies the whole essence of the case against the vulgarisers.
And it’s just the essence which you haven’t noticed.
Grimm repeats the error of the vulgarisers, and you indulge him by providing a wrong formulation.
On the contrary, it is just now that we must (both in talks and in articles) refute the vulgarisers for Grimm’s benefit.
We are not at all against “defence of the fatherland” in general, not against “defensive wars” in general.
You will never find that nonsense in a single resolution (or in any of N.
B.
my articles).
We are against defence of the fatherland and a defensive position in the imperialist war of 1914-16 and in other imperialist wars, typical of the imperialist epoch.
But in the imperialist epoch there may be also “just”, “defen-sive”, revolutionary wars namely (1) national, (2) civil, (3) socialist and suchlike .

BUKHARIN Dear Com.
, Unfortunately we cannot print the article “On the Theory of the Imperialist State”.
As it turns out, so much space is occupied with material from Russia that all other subjects are restricted, and there is not enough money.
Things are difficult.
But the main thing is not that.
The main thing is some defects in the article.
The title does not correspond to the contents.
The article consists of two parts, the combination of which has been insufficiently thought out: (1) about the state in general, and (2) about state capitalism and its growth (especially in Germany).
The second part is good and useful, but nine-tenths legal.
We would advise you to print it in one of the legal reviews (if not in Letopis), after very little alteration, and would be ready to do everything we can to help such publication.
The first part touches on a subject of tremendous impor-tance in principle, but that’s just it—it only touches on it.
We cannot, when publishing a review once a year, print on such a basic question of theory an article which has been in-sufficiently thought out.
Leaving aside the polemic against Gumplowicz, etc.
(that would also be better worked over and developed into a legal article), we must point out a num-ber of extremely inexact formulations by the author.
Marxism is a “sociological” (???) “theory of the state”; the state=the “general”(?) organisation of the ruling classes; the quotations from Engels are broken off just at thosepoints which are particularly important, if you are discussing this subject.
The distinction between the Marxists and the anarchists on the question of the state (pp.
15-16) has been defined absolutely incorrectly: if you are to deal with this sub-ject, you must speak not in that way; you must not speak in that way.
The conclusion (the author gives it in italics): “Social-Democracy must intensively underline its hostility in principle to the state power” (p.
53)—[compare: the pro-letariat creates “its provisional state organisation of power” (p.
54) (“state organisation of power”!?)]—is also either supremely inexact, or incorrect.
Our advice is to work up into legal articles (α ) the section about state capitalism and ( β ) the polemic with Gumplowicz and Co.
Leave the rest to mature.
That is our conviction.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Friend, Evidently Belenin’s decision about his “trip” has already been taken, judging by the letter which Grigory has sent me today.
And the time is quite short! Yet we have particular reason to exchange letters and come to an understanding with him: this is now incredibly important.
Therefore I most earnestly request you to take all possible steps to see Be-lenin personally, to pass on to him all that follows, and frank-ly and also in detail write to me (without fail!) how matters stand, i.
e.
, whether or not there are differences, divergen-cies, etc.
, between us and Belenin, and what they are (and how to eliminate them, if they exist).
The elimination of James 243 (I earnestly ask you not to say one word about this elimination to a single person abroad: you cannot imagine how dangerous in all respects is chatter abroad on these subjects, and in connection with such events)—the elimination of James makes the position critical and once again raises the question of the general plan of work.
In my convinced opinion, this plan is composed, first, of the theoretical line, secondly, of the most immediate tactical tasks and, thirdly, of direct organisational tasks.
(1) On the first point, the order of the day now is not only the continuation of the line we have endorsed (against tsar-ism, etc.
) in our resolutions and pamphlet * (this line has * The resolutions of the Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.

been remarkably confirmed by events, by the split in Brit-ain, 2 4 4 etc.
), but also cleansing it of the stupidities which have accumulated, and the muddle about rejecting democra-cy (this includes disarmament, repudiation of self-determi-nation, the theoretically wrong rejection “in general” of defence of the fatherland, the wobblings on the question of the role and significance of the state in general, etc.
).
It will be an extreme pity if Belenin does not receive my article in reply to Kievsky (just yesterday it was sent to be transcribed, and will he ready only in a few days).
What are we to do? Don’t neglect the necessity of coming to an understanding on theoretical questions: really and truly, it is essential for work in such difficult times.
Think over whether we could not put into effect the following plan (or something similar); I am beginning to realise that Bele-nin’s wife is not in America, as I thought, but in Spain, through which Belenin will of course travel now.
Could we not organise the copying and passing on of manuscripts to his wife in Spain? In that case perhaps my article, too, even if sent in a week from now, would reach Belenin in time, because he will certainly spend a few days in Spain.
Think it over; apart from this special case, regular corres-pondence with Belenin’s wife, and with Spain in general, is extremely important.
Spain is a supremely important point just now, because it is still more convenient to work there than in Britain and elsewhere.
I cannot dwell more fully on theoretical agreement.
The enemy has already seized on the stupid repudiation of the significance of democracy (Potresov 245 in No.
1 of Dyelo).
Bazarov has made a fool of himself in Letopis.
Bogdanov is talking another kind of balderdash, but also balderdash in Letopis.
An exceptionally suspicious bloc of the Machists and the O.
C.
-ists has come into being there.
A shameful bloc! It’s hardly likely that we can break it up.
.
.
.
Should we perhaps try a bloc with the Machists against the O.
C.
-ists? Hardly likely to succeed!! Gorky is always supremely spineless in politics, a prey to emotion and passing moods.
The legal press in Russia is acquiring exceptional impor-tance, and therefore the question of the correct line, too, becomes still more and more important, because it is easier for the enemy to “bombard” us in this field.
The best thing would be, probably, if Belenin could have a “base” in Spain and receive our letters and manuscripts there: we could continue our discussion, exchange letters, Belenin could return there soon after his short trip further on (for the danger is very great, and it would be much more useful for our cause if Belenin made brief trips round a few cities and then returned to Spain, or to where he is now, or to a neighbouring country to consolidate contacts, etc.
).
On the second point.
The main thing now, I think, is to publish popular leaflets and manifestos against tsarism.
Con-sider whether this could be organised in Spain? If not, we shall prepare them here and send them on.
For this the most efficient transport contacts are essential.
You were quite right: the Japanese have proved absolutely useless.
Best of all would be foreigners, with whom we could corres-pond in English or some other foreign language.
I will not dwell on the question of transport, because you yourself realise and know this.
The trouble is that there is no money, but they should collect some in Petersburg.
The main Party question in Russia has been and remains the question of “unity”.
Trotsky in the 500 or 600 issues of his paper has not managed to speak out, or to think out, fully whether there is to be unity with Chkheidze, Sko-belev and Co.
, or not.
I think there are still some “unifiers” in Petersburg as well, though very weak (was it not they who published Rabochiye Vedomosti in Petersburg?).
246 “Makar”, they say, is in Moscow and also playing the conciliator.
Conciliationism and unificationism is the most harmful thing for the workers’ party in Russia—not just idiocy, but the destruction of the Party.
For in practice “unifica-tion” (or conciliation and the like) with Chkheidze and Sko-belev (they are the key point, because they give themselves out to be “ internationalists”) is “unity” with the O.
C.
, and through it with Potresov and Co.
, i.
e.
, in practice it is play-ing the lackey to the social-chauvinists.
If Trotsky and Co.
have not understood this, so much the worse for them.
Dyelo No.
1 and—especially—the participation of the work-ers in the war industries committees, prove that this is so.
Not only in elections to the Duma the day after peace is signed, but in general on all questions of Party practice, “unity” with Chkheidze and Co.
is the essential questiontoday.
We can rely only on those who have understood just how deceptive the idea of unity is and how necessary it is to break with that fraternity (Chkheidze and Co.
) in Russia.
Belenin ought to rally only such people as leaders.
By the way, a split on the international scale is also due.
I consider it quite timely now that all class-conscious lead-ing workers in Russia should understand this, and should adopt resolutions in favour of an organisational break with the Second International, with the International Bureau of Huysmans, Vandervelde and Co.
, in favour of building a Third International only against the Kautskians of all countries (Chkheidze and Co.
, also Martov and Axelrod= the Russian Kautskians), only in rapprochement with people who take the stand of the Zimmerwald Left.
On the third point.
The most pressing question now is the weakness of contacts between us and leading workers in Russia!! No correspondence!! No one but James, and now he has gone!! We can’t go on like that.
We cannot organise either the publication of leaflets or transport, either agree-ment about manifestos or sending over their drafts, etc.
, etc.
, without regular secret correspondence.
That is the key question! This Belenin did not do on his first visit (probably he couldn’t at the time).
Convince him, for Christ’s sake, that this must be done on the second visit! It must be done!! The immediate success of the visit, really and truly, must be measured by the number of contacts!! (Of course the per-sonal influence of Belenin is still more important, but he will not be able to stop anywhere for long without destroy-ing himself and harming the cause.
) The number of contacts in each city will be the measure of the success of his visit!! Two-thirds of the contacts, as a minimum, in each city, should be with leading workers, i.
e.
, they should write themselves, themselves master secret correspondence (artists are made, not born), should themselves each train up 1-2 “heirs” in case of arrest.
This should not be entrusted to the intelligentsia alone.
Certainly not.
It can and must be done by the leading workers.
Without this it is impossible to establish continuity and purpose in our work—and that is the main thing.
That’s all, I think.
As regards legal literature, I will also add: it is important to ascertain whether they will accept my articles in Letopis (if the O.
C.
-ists cannot be thrown out by means of a bloc with the Machists).
With restrictions? Which? We must find out in greater detail about Volna.
247 As regards myself personally, I will say that I need to earn.
Otherwise we shall simply die of hunger, really and truly!! The cost of living is devilishly high, and there is nothing to live on.
The cash must be dragged by force * out of the publisher of Letopis, to whom my two pamphlets ** have been sent (let him pay at once and as much as possible!).
The same with Bonch.
The same as regards translations.
If this is not organised I really will not be able to hold out, this is absolutely serious, absolutely, absolutely.
I shake you firmly by the hand and send a thousand best wishes to Belenin.
Drop me a line that you have received this immediately, just two words.
Yours, Lenin P.

106 TO FRANZ KORITSCHONER 248 October 25, 1916 Dear Friend, We regret very much that you haven’t written a single line to us so far.
One must hope that the big events in Vienna will stimulate you at long last to write to us in detail.
Berner Tagwacht (and then other papers) printed a report that at a war factory in Speyer (Austria) there was a strike of 24,000 workers, that Czech soldiers opened fire, and that 700 (seven hundred!) workers were killed! How much truth is there in this? Please let us know about it in as much detail as you can.
As regards the act of Friedrich Adler, 2 4 9 I would beg you to let us know the details.
The papers here (Berner Tagwacht and Volksrecht—do you get them both, or neither?) extol this act.
Avanti! (does Avanti! reach you?) states that Friedrich Adler was the author of the famous manifesto of the Austrian interna-tionalists.
Is that true? And is it now convenient to speak about this openly? (1) Did Friedrich Adler tell anyone about his plan? (2) Did he give any friend any documents, letters, statements to be published later? (3) Is it true, as the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung writes, that everywhere (both in the railway club and in other places) he was in a minority (and how big was that minority?), (4)——that his position in the organisa-tion had become “unbearable” (?)—(5)—that at the last party conference he received only seven votes?—(6) that at the last two meetings of trusted agents he attacked theparty extremely sharply and demanded “demonstrations”? (What kind precisely?) Please write us in as much detail as possible about all these questions, and in general give us more information and details about Friedrich Adler.
Unless you give us special instructions to the contrary, we shall print in our papers everything that we get from you (and will also pub-lish them—as material from our editorial office—in the local German-language press).
As regards the political assessment of the act, we main-tain, of course, our old conviction, confirmed by decades of experience, that individual terrorist acts are inexpe-dient methods of political struggle.
“Killing is no murder,” * wrote our old Iskra about ter-rorist acts; we are not at all opposed to political killing (in this sense the servile writings of the opportunists in Vorwärts and the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung are simply revolt-ing), but as revolutionary tactics individual attacks are inex-pedient and harmful.
Only the mass movement can be con-sidered genuine political struggle.
Only in direct, immediate connection with the mass movement can and must individ-ual terrorist acts be of value.
In Russia the terrorists (against whom we always struggled) carried out a number of individual attacks; but in December 1905, when matters at last reached the stage of a mass movement, insurrection— when it was necessary to help the masses to use violence— then just at that moment the “terrorists” were missing.
That is where the terrorists make their mistake.
Adler would have been of much greater help to the revo-lutionary movement if, without being afraid of a split, he had systematically gone over to illegal propaganda and agitation.
It would be very good if some Left group were found to publish a leaflet in Vienna which would inform the workers of its view; if it branded in the sharpest possible way the servile behaviour of the Vienna Arbeiter Zeitung and Vorwärts, morally justified Adler’s act (“kill-ing is no murder”), but as a lesson for the workers declared: not terrorism but systematic, prolonged, self-sacrificing activity in revolutionary propaganda and agitation, demon-* These words were written by Lenin in English.

strations, etc.
, etc.
, against the lackey-like opportunist party, against the imperialists, against one’s own govern-ments, against the war—that is what is needed.
Tell us also, please, how right it would be to regard Adler’s act as a gesture of despair? I think that politically it is so.
He had lost his faith in the party, he could not bear the fact that it was impossible to work with this party, that it was impossible to work with Victor Adler, he could not accept the idea of a split and take upon himself the burdensome task of a struggle against the party.
And as a result of his despair came this attempt.
An act of despair of a Kautskian (Volksrecht writes that Adler was not a supporter of the Zimmerwald Left, but rather a Kautskian).
But we revolutionaries cannot fall into despair.
We are not afraid of a split.
On the contrary, we recognise the necessity of a split, we explain to the masses why a split is inevitable and necessary, we call for work against the old party and for revolutionary mass struggle.
What trends (resp.
what individual shades of opinion) exist in Vienna and in Austria in assessing Adler’s act? I am afraid that the Vienna Government will declare Friedrich Adler insane, and not let matters come to a trial.
But if they do, it will certainly be essential to organise the distribution of leaflets.
Write more and in greater detail, and observe exactly all technical precautions.
Best greetings! Yours, N.

KIKNADZE 250 Dear Comrade, Thank you very much for your story of the Geneva argu-ments.
2 5 1 It is very important for us to have reactions from our readers.
It’s a pity that we rarely get to know them.
Lunacharsky, Bezrabotny and Co.
are people without heads.
I advise you to put the question to them squarely: let them produce written theses (and afterwards in the press), brief and clear (like our resolutions)—(1) about self-deter-mination (§ 9 of our Party Programme).
Do they agree or not with the resolution of 1913? If they don’t, why have they kept silent? Why haven’t they produced their own? (2) Why do they reject defence of the fatherland in the present war? (3) How do they pose the question of “defence of the fatherland”? (4) What is their attitude to national wars, and (5)—to national insurrections? Let them reply! They will muddle themselves up like children, I’ll take a bet.
They haven’t understood anything whatever on the question of the historical character of the “nation” and of “ defence of the fatherland”.
Since you want to argue with them, I send you my article from No.
3 (or 4) of Sbornik on this subject.
2 5 2 This is private, i.
e.
, only for you: after reading it, return it to meor give it to the Karpinskys, to return to me with their next packet.
I cannot as yet show it to everyone.
I thought that you had left, and therefore sent my letter about Swiss affairs only to Noah.
But the letter is intend-ed for you too.
Read it.
Noah does not send a word in reply.

KIKNADZE Dear Comrade, You question my remark as to the possibility of trans-forming the present imperialist war, too, into a national war.
Your argument? “We shall have to defend an imperialist fatherland”.
.
.
.
Is that logical? If the fatherland remains “imperialist”, how can the war then be national?? The talk about “possibilities”, in my opinion, has been theoretically wrongly introduced by Radek, and by § 5 of the theses of the Internationale.
253 Marxism takes its stand on the facts, and not on possi-bilities.
A Marxist must, as the foundation of his policy, put only precisely and unquestionably demonstrated facts.
That is what our (Party) resolution does.
* When instead of it we are presented with “impossibil-ity”, I reply: untrue, un-Marxist, a cliché.
All kinds of transformation are possible.
And I quote a historical fact (the wars of 1792-1815).
I take this example to illustrate the possibility of some-thing like that nowadays (if there is a development back-wards).
In my opinion, you are confusing the possible (about which it was not I who began talking!!) with the real, when you think that the recognition of a possibility allows us to alter our tactics.
That is the height of illogicality.
* See present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
158-64.
—Ed.
I recognise the possibility that a Social-Democrat way be transformed into a bourgeois, and the reverse.
An indubitable truth.
Does it follow from this that I will now recognise a particular bourgeois, Plekhanov, as a Social-Democrat? No, it does not follow.
But what about the possibility? Let’s wait for it to be transformed into reality.
That’s all.
It is precisely in “methodology” (about which you write) that one must distinguish the possible from the real.
All kinds of transformation are possible, even of a fool into a wise man, but such a transformation rarely becomes actual.
And merely because of the “possibility ” of such a transformation I shall not cease to consider the fool to be a fool.
Your perplexities about “dualistic” training are not clear to me.
For I concretely gave the example (Norway) both in Prosveshcheniye * and in my article against Kievsky.
** You don’t reply to that!! You choose the quite unclear example of Poland.
This is not “dualistic” training, but reducing different things to a common denominator, bringing Nizhni and Smolensk to a common Moscow.
A Swedish Social-Democrat who does not stand for the freedom of secession for Norway is a scoundrel.
This you do not challenge.
A Norwegian Social-Democrat may be either for secession or against it.
Is unity on such a question obligatory for all Social-Democrats of all countries? No.
That would be a cliché, a ridiculous cliché, a ridiculous pretension.
We never blamed the Polish Social-Democrats (I wrote this in Prosveshcheniye) because they were against the independence of Poland.
Instead of a simple, clear, theoretically unchallengeable argument: we cannot now be for the kind of democratic * See “The Right of Nations to Self-Determination” (present edition, Vol.
20, pp.

demand (for an independent Poland) that in practice subor-dinates us completely to one of the imperialist powers or coalitions (this is unquestionable, this is enough; it is essential and sufficient) —instead of this they talked themselves into an absurd-ity: “It is unrealisable.
” We laughed this out of court in 1903 and in April 1916.
The good Polish Social-Democrats almost, almost proved the unrealisability of a new Polish state, only .

.
only the imperialist Hindenburg interfered: he went and realised it.
254 To what ridiculous pedantry people descend when they desire (from the Cracow point of view 2 5 5 ) to make more profound (or more foolish?) the “economic” aspect!! The P.
S.
D.
have got themselves into the position of repudiating “Staatenbau” * !! But is not all democracy Staatenbau? And the independence for the Dutch Indies which Gorter demands, is not that the Staatenbau? We are for freedom of secession for the Dutch Indies.
But is a Social-Democrat of the Dutch Indies bound to be for secession? There is another example for you of what you call “dualistic” training!! War is the continuation of politics.
Belgium is a colonial-ist country, you argue.
Nevertheless, shall we really be unable to determine which politics the present war continues, the politics of Belgian slave-owning or of Belgian libera-tion?? I think we shall be able to.
And if anyone loses his way, that will be a question of fact.
One cannot, after all, “prohibit” national wars (as Radek wants) out of fear that brainless people or swindlers again pretend that the imperialist war is a national one!! That is ridiculous, yet that is the conclusion from what Radek is saying.
* “Building of a state.
”—Ed.
We are not against a national insurrection, we are for it.
That is clear.
And we cannot go further than that: we shall consider each case concretely, and I don’t think we shall take the rebellion of the South in the United States in 1863 as a “national insurrection”.

Let’s continue our correspondence.
How I laughed over your postcard, I really had to hold my sides, as they say.
“In France there is no such measure as the ha, but there is the acre, and you don’t know how big an acre is.
.
.
.
” That really is funny! It was France—imaginez-vous?—that introduced the metric system.
According to the metric system, adopted in most countries of the world, a ha = hectare = 100 ares.
An acre is not a French measure but an English one, about 4/10 of a hectare.
You mustn’t be offended over my laughing.
I didn’t mean any harm.
After all, is it so surprising that you do not often come across the words hectare, ha, etc.
? They are dull, technical words.
Many thanks for translating the theses.

with Grimm, and their forces are too small.
Well, we’ll see.
As regards women, I agree with your addendum.
You are being captious about the thesis that Social-Democrats (1) in Switzerland (2) now should not vote in any circumstances for war credits.
After all, the beginning goes on all the time about the present, imperialist war.
Nothing else but that.
“The working men have no country”—this means that (α ) his economic position (le salariat * ) is not national but international, ( β ) his class enemy is international, (γ ) the conditions of his emancipation also, (δ ) the international unity of the workers is more important than the national.
Does this mean, does it follow from this, that we should not fight when it is a question of throwing off a foreign yoke?? Yes or no? A war of colonies for emancipation? —of Ireland against England? And an insurrection (national), is not that defence of the fatherland? I will send you my article against Kievsky about this.

110 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, As regards rewording for the French, I would not under-take it.
* Perhaps you will try? They were written for the Swiss: the “military part” here is a special one (for a small state), the inner-party situation is different, etc.
, etc.
Besides, I would not be able to find concrete material about France.
I should be heartily glad to do something for the French Left, but somehow contacts don’t get established.
Grisha writes long but exceptionally meaningless letters, full of water, chews old stuff, nothing business-like, tells us noth-ing precise about the French Left, and establishes no, absolutely no contact with them.
As regards the fatherland, you evidently want to estab-lish a contradiction between my writings previously (when? 1913? where precisely? what precisely?) and now.
I don’t think there are any contradictions.
Find the exact texts, then we shall look at it again.
Of course, there were always differences between the orthodox and the opportunists as to the conception of fatherland (cf.
Plekhanov 1907 or 1910, Kautsky 1905 and 1907, and Jaurès: L’armée nouvelle).
I entirely agree with this: here the divergence was a radical one.
I don’t think I have ever said anything against that.
* Lenin refers to his theses “Tasks of the Left Zimmerwaldists in the Swiss Social-Democratic Party” (see present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
137-48).
—Ed.
That the defence of the fatherland is admissible (when it is admissible) only as the defence of democracy (in the appropriate epoch), is my opinion too.
Of course, proletarians should never “merge” with the general democratic movement.
Marx and Engels did not “merge” with the bourgeois-democratic movement in Ger-many in 1848.
We Bolsheviks did not “merge” with the bourgeois-democratic movement in 1905.
We Social-Democrats always stand for democracy, not “in the name of capitalism”, but in the name of clearing the path for our movement, which clearing is impossible without the development of capitalism.
Best greetings.

1 Printed from the original111 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, As regards “defence of the fatherland” I don’t know whether we differ or not.
You find a contradiction between my article in the collection of articles To the Memory of Marx * and my present statements, without quoting either precisely.
I cannot reply to this.
I haven’t got the collec-tion To the Memory of Marx.
Of course, I cannot remember word for word what I wrote in it.
Without precise quota-tions, then and now, I am not able to reply to such an argument on your part.
But generally speaking, it seems to me that you argue somehow in a somewhat one-sided and formalist manner.
You have taken one quotation from the Communist Mani-festo (the working men have no country) and you seem to want to apply it without any reservations, up to and includ-ing the repudiation of national wars.
The whole spirit of Marxism, its whole system, demands that each proposition should be considered (α ) only histor-ically, (β ) only in connection with others, (γ ) only in connection with the concrete experience of history.
The fatherland is an historical concept.
The fatherland in an epoch or, more precisely, at the moment of struggle for the overthrow of national oppression, is one thing.
At the moment when national movements have been left far behind, it is another thing.

be a proposition about the fatherland, and its defence, iden-tically applicable in all conditions.
In the Communist Manifesto it is said that the working men have no country.
Correct.
But not only this is stated there.
It is stated there also that when national states are being formed the role of the proletariat is somewhat special.
To take the first proposition (the working men have no country) and forget its connection with the second (the workers are constituted as a class nationally, though not in the same sense as the bourgeoisie) will be exceptionally incorrect.
Where, then, does the connection lie? In my opinion, precisely in the fact that in the democratic movement (at such a moment, in such concrete circumstances) the proletariat cannot refuse to support it (and, consequently, support defence of the fatherland in a national war).
Marx and Engels said in the Communist Manifesto that the working men have no country.
But the same Marx called for a national war more than once: Marx in 1848, Engels in 1859 (the end of his pamphlet Po and Rhine, where the national feeling of the Germans is directly in-flamed, where they are directly called upon to wage a national war).
Engels in 1891, in view of the then threatening and advancing war of France (Boulanger)&Alexander III against Germany, directly recognised “defence of the fatherland”.
258 Were Marx and Engels muddlers who said one thing today and another thing tomorrow? No.
In my view, admission of “defence of the fatherland” in a national war fully answers the requirements of Marxism.
In 1891 the German Social-Democrats really should have defended their fatherland in a war against Boulanger & Alexander III.
This would have been a peculiar variety of national war.
Incidentally, in saying this, I am repeating what I said in my article against Yuri.
* For some reason you don’t mention it.
It seems to me that on the question raised here there are precisely in that article a number of propositions which make clear completely (or nearly so) my understand-ing of Marxism.

As to Radek—my “quarrel” (???!!!) with Radek.
I had an argument last spring with Grigory, who had no under-standing at all of the political situation at that time, and reproached me for breaking with the Zimmerwald Left.
That is nonsense.
The connection with the Zimmerwald Left is also a conditional thing.
First of all, Radek is not= the Zimmer-wald Left.
Secondly, there was no “break” with Radek in general, but only in a particular sphere.
Thirdly, it is stupid to conceive of the connection with Radek in such a way that our hands should be tied in the necessary theoretical and practical struggle.
Ad 1 (to point 1).
I never, anywhere, took a single step, not a suspicion of it, not merely towards a break, but even towards weakening the ties with the “Zimmerwald Left”.
Nobody has ever pointed one out to me, or will be able to point it out.
Neither with Borchardt, nor with the Swedes, nor with Knief, etc.
, etc.
(Radek very meanly threw us out of the editorial board of Vorbote.
Radek behaves in politics like a Tyszka huck-ster, impudent, insolent, stupid.
Grigory wrote to me in the spring of 1916, when I was already in Zurich, that he had no “team work” with Radek.
Radek has moved away— that is the fact.
He moved away on account of Vorbote, both from me and from Grigory.
On account of the impudence and huckster-like meanness of one person, the Zimmer-wald Left does not cease to be Left, and there is no purpose in dragging it into the affair: it’s not sensible, not correct, Gazeta Robotnicza, in the number for February 1916, is a pattern of such a Tyszka-like rotten servile “game” (Radek follows in his footsteps).
Anyone who forgives such things in politics I consider a donkey or a scoundrel.
I shall never forgive them.
For such things you punch men’s faces or turn away.
Of course I did the second.
And I don’t repent.
We did not lose a single hair of our ties with the Left Germans.
When the problem arose of marching together with Radek in practice (the Zurich Congress of November 4-5, 1916 259 ), we went ahead together.
All Grigory’s silly phrases about my break with the Zimmerwald Left proved to be a stu-pidity, which they always were.
) Ad 2—the “sphere” of the break with Radek, therefore, were (α ) Russian and Polish affairs.
The resolution of the Committee of Organisations Abroad confirmed this.
(β) The affair with Yuri and Co.
Radek even now is writing (I can send you them if you wish) the most impudent letters to me (and Grigory) on the theme that, “we” (he & Bukharin + Yuri and Co.
) “see things” in such-and-such a way!! Only a donkey and a scoundrel, who wants to invent an “intrigue”, squeezing through the crack of differences between us and Yuri and Co.
, can write in this way.
If Radek did not understand what he was doing, then he is a donkey.
If he did understand, then he is a scoundrel.
The political task of our Party was clear: we could not tie our hands by equality in the editorial board with N.
I.
& Yuri & E.
B.
(Grigory did not understand this, and drove me to a direct ultimatum: I declared that I would resign from Kommunist if we did not break with it.
Kommu-nist was a good thing, so long as there was no separate pro-gramme of the trio who composed 1/2 the editorial board).
To grant equality to a group consisting of Bukharin&Yuri& E.
B.
would be idiocy and the ruin of all the work.
Neither Yuri, quite a little pig, nor E.
B.
has a drop of brains, and if they had allowed themselves to descend to group stupidity with Bukharin, then we had to break with them, more precisely with Kommunist.
And that was done.
The polemics over self-determination are only beginning as yet.
Here they are in complete confusion—as in the whole question about the attitude to democracy.
To grant “equality” to little pigs and fools—never! They didn’t want to learn peaceably and in comradely fashion, so let them blame themselves.
(I pestered them, provoking con-versations about it in Berne: they turned up their noses! I wrote them letters, tens of pages long, to Stockholm—they turned up their noses! Well, if that’s how it is, let them go to the devil.
I did everything possible for a peaceable out-come.
If you don’t want it, I will punch your faces and expose you as idiots before the whole world.
That, and only that, is the way to treat them.
) But where does Radek come in, you may ask.
Because he was the “heavy artillery” of this “group”, artillery hidden in the bushes on one side.
Yuri and Co.
were quite skilful in their calculations (E.
B.
is capable as an intriguer, it turned out that she was not leading Yuri to us, but setting up a group against us).
Their calcula-tion was: we shall start the war, but it’s Radek who will fight for us!! Radek will fight for us, while Lenin will have his hands tied.
But it didn’t come off, my dear little pigs! I will not let my hands be tied in politics.
If you want to fight, come out openly.
But the role of Radek—secretly inciting young pigs, but himself hiding behind the “Zimmerwald Left”— is the height of scoundrelism.
The most lousy .
.
.
of the Tyszka swamp could not have been playing the huckster, the lackey and the intriguer behind one’s back in dirtier fashion.
Ad 3—I have already stated clearly.
The question of the relationship of imperialism to democracy and the minimum programme is arising on an ever wider scale (see the Dutch programme in No.
3 of the Bulletin 2 6 0 ; the American S.
L.
P.
have thrown out the whole minimum programme.
Entwaffnungsfrage * ).
On this Radek has absolute confusion in his head (this is clear from his theses; it was also shown by the question of indirect and direct taxes raised in my theses).
I will never let my hands be tied in explaining this most important and fundamental question.
I cannot.
The question has to be cleared up.
There will be dozens of “falls” over it yet (they will stumble for certain).
Anyone who understands the “connection” with the Zim-merwald Left in such a way that we should let our hands be tied in the theoretical struggle against “imperialist Economism” (that international disease; Dutch-American-Russian, etc.
), understands nothing.
To learn by heart the words “Zim-merwald Left” and to kowtow before the utter theoretical confusion in Radek’s head, that I don’t accept.
The results: after Zimmerwald manoeuvres were more difficult.
It was necessary to take the essential from Radek, E.
B.
and Co.
, without allowing one’s hands to be tied.
I consider that I was successful in this.
After Bukharin’s departure to America and, above all, after Yuri had sent us his article and after he had accepted (he accepted! he had * The question of disarmament.
—Ed.
to accept) my reply, their affairs, as a “group”, were finished.
(Yet Grigory wanted to perpetuate that group, granting it equality: we would give it equality!!) With Radek we parted company on the Russo-Polish arena, and did not invite him into our Sbornik.
2 6 1 It had to be that way.
And now he can do nothing which could spoil the work.
He was obliged at the Zurich Congress (November 5, 1916) to go together with me, as now, against Grimm.
What does this mean? It means that I succeeded in dividing* the questions: not in one iota is the international-ist pressure on the Kautskians (Grimm y compris ** ) weak-ened, and at the same time I am not subjected to “equal-ity” with Radek’s stupidity! Strategically I now consider the cause to have been won.
It is possible that Yuri & Co.
& Radek & Co.
will abuse me.
Allez-y, mes amis! *** Now the odium will fall on you, not on us.
But you will now not injure the cause, and for us the road has been cleared.
We have disentangled our-selves from the dirty (in all senses) muddle with Yuri and Radek, without in one iota weakening the “Zimmerwald Left”, and possessing the requisites for the struggle against stupidity on the question of the attitude to democracy.
Voilà.
I apologise for this long letter and for the abun-dance of sharp words: I can’t write otherwise when I am speaking frankly.
Well, after all, this is all entre nous, and perhaps the unnecessary bad language will pass.
Best greetings.
Yours, Lenin In general, both Radek and Pannekoek are incorrect in the way they approach the question of the struggle against Kautskianism.

*** Go ahead, my friends!—Ed.
Printed from the original112 TO ARTHUR SCHMID 262 Dear Comrade, Will you allow me to suggest an amicable agreement? I must admit that yesterday I paid insufficient attention to one very important point in your arguments.
263 Namely, the idea that the peculiarity of Switzerland lies, among other things, in her greater degree of democracy (the referen-dum), and that this peculiarity should be made use of also for propaganda purposes.
This idea is very important and, in my opinion, completely correct.
Could we not apply this idea in such a way that our differences (which are probably very insignificant) should disappear? For example: If we put the question for the referendum only in this way—for complete elimination or against?—we shall get a mixture of pacifist (bourgeois-pacifist, etc.
) and socialist votes for it, i.
e.
, we shall get not a clarification of a social-ist consciousness but a darkening of it, not the application of the idea and the policy of class struggle to this particu-lar question (namely, the question of militarism) but the renunciation of the point of view of the class struggle on the question of militarism.
But if we put the question for the referendum in this way-for the expropriation of large capitalist enterprises in industry and agriculture, as the only way of completely eliminating militarism, or against expropriation? If we put it like that, we shall be saying in our practical policy the same thing that we all recognise theoretically,namely, that the complete elimination of militarism is thinkable and realisable only in connection with the elimi-nation of capitalism.
Consequently there should be approximately the follow-ing formulation: (1) we demand the immediate expropria-tion of large enterprises, perhaps in the form of a direct Federal property and income tax, with such high, revolu-tionarily-high, rates for large properties that the capi-talists will, in fact, be expropriated.
(2) We declare that such a socialist transformation of Switzerland is economically possible already today, directly, and, in consequence of the unbearably high cost of living, is urgently necessary as well, and that for the political effecting of such a transformation Switzerland needs not a bourgeois but a proletarian government, which would rely not on the bourgeoisie but on the broad masses of hired workers and small people, and that the revolutionary mass struggle which we see beginning, for example, in the mass strikes and street demonstrations in Zurich, and which is recognised by the Aarau decision, 2 6 4 pursues exactly that purpose—to put a real end in that way to the intoler-able position of the masses.
(3) We declare that such a transformation of Switzerland will quite inevitably arouse imitation and the most reso-lute enthusiastic support on the part of the working class and the mass of the exploited in all civilised countries, and that only in connection with such a transformation will the complete elimination of militarism for which we strive, and for which at present particularly wide masses in Europe are instinctively thirsting, become not an empty phrase, not an amiable wish, but a genuine, practically achievable and politically self-explanatory measure.
What do you think of this? Do you not consider that, if the question is put in this way (both in practical agitation and in parliamentary speeches and proposals for a legislative initiative and for a referendum), we shall avoid the danger that bourgeois and “socialist” pacifists will falsely understand and mis-interpret our anti-militarist slogan in the sense that we suppose it possible to completely abolish militarism inbourgeois Switzerland, in her imperialist environment, without a socialist revolution (which, of course, is nonsense that we all unanimously repudiate).

Written in German on December 1 , 1 9 1 6 Sent to Winterthur (Switzerland) First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin Miscellany XVII Printed from a typewritten copy113 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, Another letter has arrived today from St.
Petersburg— they have been attentive in their writing lately.
Apart from the letter from Guchkov, 2 6 5 which is going into No.
57 of the Central Organ (being set), and which probably Grigory showed you in Berne, letters from Lvov and Chelnokov 2 6 6 have been received, all on the same subject, the country’s bitter indignation (against the traitors carrying on negotiations for a separate peace), etc.
The mood, they write, is supremely revolutionary.
My manuscript about imperialism has reached Petersburg, and now they write today that the publisher (and this is Gorky! oh the calf!) is dissatisfied with the sharp passages against .

Kautsky! He wants to get in touch with me about it!!! Both laughable and disap-pointing.
There it is, my fate.
One fighting campaign after another-against political stupidities, philistinism, opportunism and so forth.
It has been going on since 1893.
And so has the hatred of the philistines on account of it.
But still, I would not exchange this fate for “peace” with the philistines.
Now there is Radek as well.
No.

We (Grigory and I) at once recognised Bukharin.
I replied to his exceptional stupidities in No.

There is the same article in it (with cuts, obviously made by the censors), signed by Bukharin.
(We have received one more number of Novy Mir, from New York, containing a criticism—alas, alas! A correct one: that is the tragedy, that a Menshevik is right against Bukharin!!— a criticism evidently of the same article (in a number which we haven’t got) by Bukharin in Novy Mir.
) And Radek—“Tyszka’s methods”, Grigory writes to me today-publishes in No.
25 of Arbeiterpolitik praise of Bukharin (“a young force”) and a little note, in passing, about the “three editors of Kommunist”! He squeezes into the crack of the differences between us: the time-honoured policy of riffraff and scoundrels, incapable of arguing with us straightforwardly and resorting to intrigues, double-dealing, baseness.
There is a picture for you of what is, and of what Radek does (a man is judged not by what he says or thinks about himself, but by what he does—do you remember that Marxist truth?).
Voilà.
This is the kind of “environment” one has to fight with!! And what theoretical disgrace and nonsense in Radek’s “theses”.

I have been reading the Plaidoirie 2 6 7 by Humbert-Droz.

Is he really hopeless after all? I am wondering whether there are not in Switzerland bacilli of petty-bourgeois (and petty-state) thick-wittedness, Tol-stoyism, and pacifism, which destroy the best people? I am sure there must be! I have read the second pamphlet by P.

N.

If they write to you that the publisher owes me “in addition to the 500 rubles another 300 rubles”, I must say that I consider he owes me more, because he accepted (1) my work on the agrarian question, Part 1 * and (2) my wife’s booklet on an educational subject.
2 6 8 And I consider that there is an obligation to pay for what has been accepted, once the manuscript has been delivered.
I wrote about this to Petersburg, but my contacts with Petersburg are exceptionally weak and intolerably slow.
You “thought it possible” to throw out the criticism of Kautsky in my pamphlet 2 6 9 .

Sad! Really, really sad.
Why? Would it not be better to ask the publishers: print outright, gentlemen, that we—the publishers—have eli-minated criticism of Kautsky.
Really, that is how it should have been done.

Of course, I am obliged to submit to the publisher, but let the publisher not be afraid to say what he wants and what he doesn’t want; let the publisher answer for the cuts, not I.

XXIX Printed from the original115 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, About Radek.
You write: “I told him at Kienthal that he had behaved badly.
” Is that all? Only that! What about the political conclu-sion?? Or was his action only an accident?? Only his personal affair?? Nothing of the kind! There is the source of your political mistake.
You do not assess what is going on poli-tically.
Yet really this is a question of politics, however strange it might seem at first sight.
As regards defence of the fatherland.
It would be most unpleasant for me if we differed on this.
Let us try once more to come to agreement.
Here is some “material for reflection”: War is the continuation of politics.
Everything depends on the system of political relations before the war and during the war.
The main types of these systems are (a) the relation of the oppressed nation to the oppressing, (b) the relation between two oppressing nations on account of the loot, its division, etc.
, (c) the relation of a national state which does not oppress others to one which oppresses, to a partic-ularly reactionary state.
Think over this.
Caesarism in France & tsarism in Russia against non-imperialist Germany in 1891—that was the historical situation in 1891.
Think over that! And I was writing of 1891 in No.

And the article by bb about this speech in Volksrecht is rotten too.
Oh, how I would like to write about this, or to have a talk with the Italian!! How stupid that Levi is attacking parliamentarism!! Stupid!! And a “Left”, too!! God, how much muddle there is in people’s heads.
Yours, Lenin Written later than December 2 3 , 1 9 1 6 Sent from Zurich to Clarens First published in 1 9 4 9 in Bolshevik No.
1 Printed from the original116 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, About Radek you, following Grigory, seem to have got confused between personal impressions and sadness over the “dark” political picture in general and politics.
You are sorry, you regret, you sigh-and nothing more.
No other policy than that which was followed could have been pursued.
We could not renounce correct views and surrender to “Tyszka’s methods”.
The picture is “dark” not because of this, and the Lefts are weak not because of this, and Vorbote is not appearing not because of this—but because the revo-lutionary movement grows extremely slowly and with diffi-culty.
This has to be put up with; rotten blocs with a certain person (or with E.
B.
& Kii) would only interfere with performing the difficult task of standing fast in difficult times.
As regards “imperialist Economism”, it somehow turns out that we are “talking past each other”.
You evade the definition I gave, pass it by and put the question again.
The “Economists” did not “renounce” political struggle (as you write)—that is inaccurate.
They defined it wrongly.
The “imperialist Economists” do the same.
You write: “Would even the complete rejection of demo-cratic demands mean rejecting the political struggle? Is not the direct struggle for the conquest of power political struggle?” The whole point is that with Bukharin (and partly with Radek as well) this is just the kind of thing you get, and it is wrong.
“The direct struggle forthe conquest of power” while “completely rejecting demo-cratic demands ” is something unclear, unthought-out, confused.
This is just what Bukharin is confused about.
More precisely, you approach the question from rather a different point of view, when you see a contradiction between §§ 2 and 8.
In §2 there is a general statement: the socialist revolution is impossible without the struggle for democracy.
This is unquestionable, and this is just the weakness of Radek & Bukharin that they, while disagreeing (like you), don’t venture to challenge it!! But further, in a certain sense for a certain period, all democratic aims (not only self-determination! Note that! You have forgotten that!) are capable of hindering the socialist revolution.
In what sense? At what moment? When? How? For example, if the movement has already developed, the revolution has already begun, we have to seize the banks, and we are being appealed to: wait, first consolidate, legitimise the republic, etc.
! An example: in August 1905, the boycott of the Duma was correct, and was not rejection of political struggle.
((§ 2= in general, refusal to participate in representative institutions is an absurdity; § 8= there are cases when we have to refuse; there is a visual comparison for you which makes clear that there is no contradiction between §2 and § 8.
)) Against Junius.
The situation is the imperialist war.
The remedy for it? Only a socialist revolution in Germany.
Junius did not draw this conclusion, and took democracy without the socialist revolution.
One should know how to combine the struggle for demo-cracy and the struggle for the socialist revolution, sub-ordinating the first, to the second.
In this lies the whole difficulty; in this is the whole essence.
The Tolstoyans and the anarchists throw out the first.
Bukharin and Radek have become confused, failing to com-bine the first with the second.
But I say: don’t lose sight of the main thing (the socialist revolution); put it first (Junius has not done this); put all the democratic demands, but subordinating them to it, co-ordinating them with it (Radek & Bukharin unwiselyeliminate one of them), and bear in mind that the struggle for the main thing may blaze up even though it has begun with the struggle for something partial.
In my opinion, only this conception of the matter is the right one.
A war of France & Russia against Germany in 1891.
You take “my criterion”, and apply it only to France and Russia!!!! For pity’s sake, where is the logic here? That’s just what I say, that on the part of France and Russia it would have been a reactionary war (a war in order to turn back the development of Germany, to return her from national unity to dismemberment).
But on the part of Germany? You are silent.
Yet that is the chief thing.
For Germany in 1891, the war did not, and could not, have an imperialist character.
You have forgotten the main thing—that in 1891 no imperialism existed at all (I have tried to show in my pamphlet that it was born in 1898-1900, not earlier), and there was no imperialist war, there could not be, on the part of Germany.
(By the way, there was no revolutionary Russia then either; that is very important.
) Furthermore, you write: “The ‘possibility’ of the dis-memberment of Germany is not excluded in the 1914-17 war either”, simply sliding away from the assessment of what exists to what is possible.
That is not historical.
It is not political.
What exists today is an imperialist war on both sides.
This we have said 1,000 times.
This is the essence.
And the “possible”!!?? All kinds of things are “possible”! It is ridiculous to deny the “possibility ” of transforming the imperialist war into a national war (though Usiyovich was horrified at the idea!).
What is not “possible” on this earth! But so far it has not been transformed.
Marxism buttresses its policy on the actual, not on the “possible”.
It is possible that one phenomenon will change into an-other-and our tactics are not fossilised.
Parlez-moi de la réalité et non pas des possibilités! * Engels was right.
In my day I have seen an awful lot of hasty charges that Engels was an opportunist, and my attitude to them is supremely distrustful.
Try, I say, * Talk to me of reality and not of possibilities!—Ed.
and prove first that Engels was wrong!! You won’t prove it! Engels’s foreword to The Class Struggles in France 270 ? Don’t you know that it was distorted in Berlin against his will? Is that serious criticism? His statement about the Belgian strike 271 ? When? Where? What? I don’t know it.
No.
No.
Engels was not infallible.
Marx was not infalli-ble.
But if you want to point out their “fallibility” you have to set about it differently, really, quite differently.
Otherwise you are 1,000 times wrong.

1 Printed from the originalQQW 117 TO INESSA ARMAND A meeting of the C.
C.
of the Swiss party was held here on Sunday (January 7).
The scoundrel Grimm at the head of all the Rights got carried (against Nobs, Platten, Münzenberg and Naine) a decision to postpone, for an indefinite period, the party congress which had been fixed for February 11, 1917 specially on the question of the war.
The reasons were false.
In reality it was his desire for a bloc with the Rights, with the social-patriots, who threatened to resign if defence of the fatherland were rejected!! They don’t want to allow the Swiss workers to decide the question of defence of the fatherland!!! Naine, they say, told Grimm excellently that he was cutting his own throat as international secretary.
Chairman of Zimmerwald, etc.
—yet such a scoundrel in politics! I have a mind to write an open letter to Charles Naine, * a member of the International Socialist Commission, to publish it, to call Grimm a blackguard in it, and to say that I don’t want to be in the Zimmerwald organisation with such a type, and am sending a reasoned statement on this to my Central Committee.
It’s important to “catch” Grimm immediately, en flagrant délit ** —to expose him (since “they” will not let anything get into the press), to tear off his mask.

If you have run across the issue of Neue Zeit with Kautsky’s story (and Engels’s letters) about how they distorted Engels’s preface to Klassenkämpfe, it would be a good thing if you copied it out in full detail in a special notebook.
If you can’t, then send me the exact number of Neue Zeit, the year, volume and page.
272 Your attacks on Engels, I am convinced, are totally groundless.
Excuse my frankness.
One must prepare much more seriously before writing like that! Otherwise it’s easy to disgrace oneself—I warn you entre nous, as a friend, between ourselves, in case you begin talking in this way some day in the press or at a meeting.
The Belgian strike? First of all it is possible that on this question of fact, an individual question, Engels was mista-ken.
Of course, that is possible.
One must collect every-thing he wrote on this question.
Secondly, events in recent times in general, 1905 definitely, have provided something new about general strikes, which Engels did not know.
Engels had been accustomed for decades to hear about the “general strike” only the empty phrases of the anar-chists, whom he legitimately hated and despised.
But later events have demonstrated a new type of “mass strike”, a political one, i.
e.
, a particularly non-anarchist one.
This new feature Engels did not know yet, and could not know.
This must not be forgotten.
Was not the Belgian strike a transition from the old to the new? Could Engels at that time (1891-92?? He was already 71-72; dying) see that this was not the old Belgianbelch (the Belgians for a long time were Proudhonists), but the transition to something new? This must be thought over.
As regards “defence of the fatherland”, in my opinion, you are falling into abstraction and unhistoricalness.
I repeat what I said in the article against Yuri*: defence of the fatherland= justification for taking part in the war.
Nothing more.
To generalise this, to make it a “general principle”, is ridiculous, supremely unscientific.
(I will send you the American programme of the S.
L.
P.
, with this ridiculous generalisation.
) Wars are a supremely varied, diverse, complex thing.
One cannot approach them with a general pattern.
(I) Three main types: the relation of an oppressed nation to the oppressor (every war is the continuation of politics; politics is the relationship between nations, classes, etc.
).
As a general rule, war is legitimate on the part of the oppressed (irrespective of whether it is defensive or offensive in the military sense).
(II) The relation between two oppressor nations.
The struggle for colonies, for markets, etc.
(Rome and Carthage; Britain and Germany 1914-17).
As a general rule, a war of that kind is robbery on both sides; and the attitude of democracy (and socialism) to it comes under the rule: “Two thieves are fighting, may they both perish”.
.
.
.
(III) The third type.
A system of nations with equal rights.
This question is much more complex!!!! Especially if side by side with civilised, comparatively democratic nations there stands tsarism.
That’s how it was (approxi-mately) in Europe from 1815 to 1905.
1891.
The colonial policy of France and Germany was insignificant.
Italy, Japan, the United States had no col-onies at all (now they have).
In Western Europe a system had come into being (N.
B.
this!! Think over this!! Don’t forget this!! We live not only in separate states, but also in a certain system of states; it is permissible for the anarch-ists to ignore this; we are not anarchists), a system of states, on the whole constitutional and national.
Side by side with them was powerful, unshaken, pre-revolutionary tsarism, which had plundered and oppressed everyone for hundreds of years which crushed the revolutions of 1849 and 1863.
* See present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
28-76.
—Ed.
Germany (in 1891) was the country of advanced socialism.
And this country was menaced by tsarism in alliance with Boulangism! The situation was quite, quite different from what it is in 1914-17, when tsarism has been undermined by 1905, while Germany is waging a war to dominate the world.
A different pair of shoes!! To identify, even to compare the international situations of 1891 and 1914, is the height of unhistoricalness.
Stupid Radek wrote recently in the Polish manifesto (“Befreiang Polens”) that “Staatenbau” is not the aim of the Social-Democratic struggle.
This is arch-stupidity! It is half-anarchism, half-idiocy! No, no, we are not at all indifferent to the Staatenbau, to the system of states, to their mutual relations.
Engels was the father of “passive radicalism”?? Untrue! Nothing of the kind.
You will never be able to prove this.
(Bogdanov and Co.
tried, but only disgraced themselves.
) In the imperialist war of 1914-17, between two imperialist coalitions, we must be against “defence of the fatherland”, since (1) imperialism is the eve of socialism, (2) imperialist war is a war of thieves over their booty, (3) in both coali-tions there is an advanced proletariat, (4) in both a socialist revolution is ripe.
Only for these reasons are we against “defence of the fatherland”, only for these reasons!! Best greetings and wishes.
Yours, Lenin I have sent for the addresses of the youth organisations.
They have been promised me.
And so, as regards the plan of publication: push ahead with the affair.
And your lecture on pacifism? 273 P.
S.
I got both your last two letters at once, but it must have been my own fault.
Written on January 1 9 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Clarens First published in 1 9 4 9 in Bolshevik No.
1 Printed from the original119 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, Your lecture was yesterday, and I am impatiently waiting for news of how it went off.
When I got your express letter on Thursday, I hurried to Radek at the other end of the town and collected some cuttings from him.
I wanted very much to write you a long letter on pacifism (an extremely important subject in general, a basic one from the point of view of the whole international situation today, about which I wrote in the article * —I have received it, merci!— and lastly a particularly important subject for Switzerland).
But I did not manage it: both on Thursday and on Friday we had meetings of the Lefts.
Things have gone badly for the Lefts here, because Nobs and Platten have become frightened of a war against Grimm, who furiously attacked the referendum274 and frightened, our young friends!! Sad!! In Berne, judging from Grigory’s letters, things are better.
Radek, at my insistence, has written a little pamphlet against the “Centre” here and Grimm, but yesterday the “Lefts” defeated (!!) the plan that it should be published by the Lefts: they have been frightened by the fright of Nobs and Platten.
What warriors! What Lefts! I think you should consider your lecture last night a rehearsal, and make ready to repeat it in Geneva and La Chaux-de-Fonds.
It is worth working up this subject, * Reference is apparently to the article “Bourgeois Pacifism and Socialist Pacifism ” (see present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
175-94).
—Ed.
and lecturing on it more than once.
It will do the Swiss a tremendous lot of good.
Write in as much detail as possible how you put the question, what arguments you advanced, what objections you met, etc.
Have the draft resolutions for the Swiss Congress on defence of the fatherland and the question of the war been translated into French? I mean translation in the press: Grütlianer, Sentinelle, etc.
Or not? It would be well to arrange for their translation, if it has not been done, and to think about agitation and propaganda.
Probably this question will go ahead in connection with your visit to Chaux-de-Fonds.
I shall await news from you.
Abramovich is working wonderfully, and he should be supported in every possible way.
All possible greetings.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
Trotsky has sent in a silly letter.
We shall neither print it nor reply to him.
Has any campaign begun in the press of French Swit-zerland about (1) the referendum and (2) the resolutions on the war question for the Congress? Or is there no campaign? Do you see, and regularly, Volksrecht and Berner Tagwacht? This is essential now; we have to help the Swiss Lefts.
Did I write to you that Guilbeaux refused to sign the resolution against Grimm? (Or maybe you have heard this already from Grigory?) He’s not up to much, our Guil-beaux; he’s afraid of a war with Grimm, he’s afraid of Sokolnikov, who is afraid of a split; he’s afraid of Merrheim, who is afraid of “Monsieur” Jouhaux!! Well, what warri-ors!! I want to write about this to Olga.
Written on January 2 2 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Clarens Published for the first time in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original120 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I send you the cuttings I have taken from Radek (only up to Saturday: return them (to me) immediately after the lecture).
Note the paragraph in the resolution of the Internationale which declares against pacifism (against “persuasion”).
The conference at The Hague and similar pacifist declarations and measures undertaken by the governments and the bourgeoisie are produced (1) by hypocrisy (2) by deception of the people (3) by the trend of bourgeois pacifism, possessing “big” names and dreaming of peace without a social revolution.
This trend has a vast literature (aristocratic, not for the people) (4) by calculation: it is convenient sometimes for one, sometimes for another power to “show itself” peaceful, to gain time, etc.
This is in general.
Concretely, one must study each partic-ular case, and each power.
I haven’t got the figures you ask for.
(The addresses have been sent: Abramovich and his friends are the best people to give a recommendation, if required.
) The key to the question of pacifism (a question most important for Switzerland): the idea that war is not con-nected with capitalism, is not the continuation of the politics of peacetime.
In this lies the theoretical falsity; the practical one is evasion of the social revolution.
In great haste.
Greetings.
Yours, Lenin Written between January 2 2 and 3 0 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Clarens First published in 1 9 4 9 in Bolshevik No.
1 Printed from the original121 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I have received the cuttings.
Merci! We were recently visited by two escaped prisoners of war.
It was interesting to see “live” people, not corroded by emigrant life.
As types: one is a Jew from Bessarabia, who has seen life, a Social-Democrat or nearly a Social-Democrat, has a brother who is a Bundist, etc.
He has knocked about, but is uninteresting as an individual because commonplace.
The second is a Voronezh peasant, a man of the soil, from an Old Believers’ family.
A breath from the Black Earth.
It was extremely interesting to watch him and listen.
He spent a year in a German prison camp (a mass of horrors) with 27,000 Ukrainians.
The Germans build up camps according to nations, and do their utmost to break them away from Russia; for the Ukrainians they sent in skilful lecturers from Galicia.
The results? Only 2,000, according to him, were for “self-rule” (independence in the sense more of autonomy than of separation) after months of effort by the agitators!! The remainder, he says, were furious at the thought of separation from Russia and going over to the Germans or Austrians.
A notable fact! One cannot but believe him.
27,000 is a big number.
A year is ample time.
The conditions for the Galician propaganda were exceptionally favourable.
And yet closeness to the Great Russians got the upper hand! This does not imply, of course, that “freedom of separation” is in any way wrong.
On the contrary.
But it follows fromthis that, maybe, fate will free Russia from the “Austrian type” of development.
As regards defence of the fatherland our Voronezh man is like Troyanovsky and Plekhanov.
He sympathises with socialism, but “if the Germans are pushing on, why shouldn’t we defend ourselves? “He doesn’t understand.
He is deeply hurt (both he and the Jew!!) that the Germans are so mercilessly beating “our people”.
As regards the tsar and God, all the 27,000, he says, have finished with them com-pletely, as regards the big landowners too.
They will return to Russia embittered and enlightened.
All the yearning of the Voronezh man is to get back home, to the land, to his farm.
He traipsed around the German villages working, kept his eyes open and learned a lot.
They praise the French (in the prison camps) as good comrades.
“The Germans also curse their Kaiser.
” They hate the English: “Swelled heads; won’t give you a piece of bread if you won’t wash the floor for them” (that’s the kind of swine you got, perverted by imperialism!).
To change the subject, what a splendid row has arisen over the referendum, especially its preamble! Delightful! You should have seen the articles by Grimm and Co.
in Berner Tagwacht and the “provincial” Social-Democratic press! One continuous howl and groan! We’ve hit the scoundrels just where it hurt.
I did my utmost to incite Radek he is still here, and we are maintaining—you didn’t expect it?— the utmost friendship, as always against the “Centre”, when there is no ground for Radekite twisting, diplomacy about “rights”, etc.
) to write a little pamphlet: we walked about Zurich for hours with me “nagging” him.
He sat down and wrote it.
Our “Lefts”, frightened by Nobs and Platten (those heroes were frightened by Grimm, who him-self was frightened by Greulich and Co.
!!), heard it read and turned it down (!!): it must not be printed, or they would be expelled from the Party (!!).
We shall print it separately.
The situation is such that interest has been heightened, and that all who are internationalists not merely in words must help the Swiss workers and the Left.
And we shall help them!And yet another subject.
I have been rereading Engels’s Zur Wohnungsfrage275 with his preface of 1887.
Do you know it? Wonderful! I am still “in love” with Marx and Engels, and cannot calmly stand any abuse of them.
No, these were real people! We must learn from them.
We must not leave that basis.
.
It was from that basis that both the social-chauvinists and the Kautskians departed.
(By the way, have you seen the Loriot-Rappoport, Saumoneau resolution? 2 7 6 Also w Kautskian.
I want to write something for the French, to demolish it and pacifism as a whole.
I will ask Grisha whether he will publish it.
He did not reply about my answer to Souvarine! * ).
Well, each and every good wish, I’ve chattered three bags full.
All the best.

122 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I was very glad to have your letter.
I like the plan of your lecture * very much.
I advise you to be sure to repeat it, to challenge H.
Droz to battle, to supplement the lec-ture with a section on the revolution (only perhaps the size of the lecture will not permit it?), i.
e.
, how can the revolution take place, what is the dictatorship of the proletariat, why is it necessary, why is it impossible with-out arming the proletariat, why is it fully compatible with complete, all-round democracy (in spite of the vulgar opinion)? Droz and the other Swiss social-pacifists do not under-stand it; they have not thought it out; and the Swiss con-ditions d’un petit État et de la petite bourgeoisie d’un petit État** generate in every possible way precisely pbs (=petty-bourgeois) pacifism.
If you receive Volksrecht and Berner Tagwacht (it is essential to read these two papers), that is, in my opinion, enough for judging the position of the Centre, which is exactly the position of Grimm (the scoundrel! How fraud-ulently he “fights” the social-patriot Huber-Rohrschach!!), and to which both Nobs and Platten have ( w ) descended.
You are terribly mistaken if you are not joking, when you write of my “influence” on Platten.
This is how matters * A lecture on pacifism.

stand: he and Nobs “put themselves down” as Lefts at Zimmerwald and Kienthal.
I made dozens of attempts to draw them into discussions, a study circle, talks.
All in vain!! They are afraid of Grimm and of a struggle against him.
They are w in the “Centre”.
They are almost hopeless.
Perhaps a strong movement of the Left will straighten them out, but even that is hardly likely! Today we have not yet received the corrected resolution.
We hope for it tomorrow.
Münzenberg told me yesterday that on Tuesday they are having a conference of the Young from German-and French-speaking Switzerland.
By that time we must have our reso-lution on the question of the war.
(Radek undertook to draft one, but so far has not produced it.
) My opinion is that you should set to work as hard as you can, so as before Tuesday to be able (I) to write to Geneva and Ch.
-de-F.
* that for the time being they should take my theses (the paragraphs on the question of the war, section I) as a basis; (2) to discover who will he a the meeting of the Young from French Switzerland; (3) to “work them over”, “in-struct” them, so that they understand what really distin-guishes us from (α ) social-pacifism and (β ) the “Centre” ( = Grimm and Co.
).
(Platten has understood absolutely nothing, and doesn’t want to learn.
) Our position, in gen-eral,= Karl Liebknecht, the struggle against social-patriot-ism and the Centre of one’s own country; the inseparable connection between the struggle against the war and the struggle against opportunism, and all-round and immediate revolutionary work for the socialist revolution.
The preamble to the referendum, by the way,= the first step to a platform of the Left in Switzerland.
N.
B.
this.
On Tuesday the Young from French Switzerland will definitely put forward a draft Left resolution and fight for it.
I have not yet seen the corrections, but I am sure that he is injuring the cause (reconciling and muddling the differences between the Left and the Swiss social-patriots, not opening them up.
In this lies the whole essence and the whole foulness of Grimm’s articles in Berner Tag-wacht and Neues Leben about the majority and the minority).
* La Chaux-de-Fonds.
—Ed.
Try to make friends with the French internees, start corresponding with them, make contacts, found (a secret and informal) group of Lefts among them.
Most important! The slogan of “a mass movement” is not bad, but it is not completely correct.
Because it forgets the revolution, the conquest of power, the dictatorship of the proletariat.
N.
B.
this!! Or more correctly: the support and development (at once) of every kind of revolutionary mass actions, with the object of bringing nearer the revolution, etc.
Platten=a muddlehead.
With Scheidemann or with Lieb-knecht? he asks, not understanding that the very thing Grimm is doing is “reconciling”, uniting, confusing the Swiss social-patriots (Greulich and Co.
) and the Swiss “Left”, who are quite politically unconscious!!! You are right: revolutionary struggle against the high cost of living, strikes, demonstrations, etc.
, at once.
At once “go to the people”, i.
e.
, to the masses, to the majority of the oppressed, preaching the socialist revolution (i.
e.
, taking over the banks and all large-scale enterprises).
Very best wishes.
Yours, Lenin Written on February 3 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Clarens Published for the first time in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original123 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI February 17, 1917 Dear A.
M.
, We had your letter today, and were very glad to get it.
For a long time we did not know that you were in Ame-rica, and had no letters from you except one, telling us that you were leaving America.
I wrote to you on January 7-8 (the day the letter was forwarded from Stockholm—all the letters direct from here to America are intercepted by the French!), but evidently this letter (with an article for Novy Mir) did not reach you while you were still in New York.
Pleasant as it was to learn from you of the victory of N.
Iv.
and Pavlov in Novy Mir (I get this newspaper dev-ilishly irregularly; it must be the fault of the post and not the dispatch department of the paper itself), it was just as sad to read about the bloc between Trotsky and the Right for the struggle against N.
Iv.
What a swine this Trotsky is—Left phrases, and a bloc with the Right against the Zimmerwald Left!! He ought to be exposed (by you) if only in a brief letter to Sotsial-Demokrat! I have already received No.
1 of The Internationalist, and am very glad of it.
I have inadequate information about the conference of the S.
L.
P.
and the S.
P.
on January 6-7, 1917.
It appears that the S.
L.
P.
is throwing out all its minimum programme (there is a temptation and a danger for Bukharin, who has been stumbling “at that there spot” since 1915!!).
It is a great pity that I cannot collect all thedocuments about the S.
L.
P.
(I asked Bukharin about it, but letters clearly get lost).
Have you any material? I could return it after reading.
I am preparing (have almost got the material ready) an article on the question of the attitude of Marxism to the state.
2 7 7 I have come to conclusions which are even sharper against Kautsky than against Bukharin (have you seen his “ Nota Bene” in No.
6 of Jugend-Internationale? and Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata No.
2 * ?).
The question is exceptionally important.
Bukharin is far better than Kautsky, but Bukharin’s mistakes may destroy this “just cause” in the struggle with Kautskianism.
I will send you my article about self-determination against P.
Kievsky.
** What a pity we have no money! We would publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata No.
3 (all the material is ready and waiting) and No.
4 (Bukharin’s article about the state, which we rejected at first, and my article on the state)! The Zimmerwald Right, in my opinion, has ideologically buried Zimmerwald: Bourderon & Merrheim in Paris voted for pacifism, Kautsky also on January 7, 1917 in Berlin, Turati (December 17, 1916!!) and the whole Italian party also.
This is the death of Zimmerwald!! In words they condemned “social-pacifism” (see the Kienthal resolution), while in practice they have turned towards it!! Grimm has basely turned towards the social-patriots within the Swiss party (our friend in Stockholm will send you material about it), entering into a bloc with them on January 7, 1917 (Parteivorstandssitzung*** ) against the Left for postponement of the Congress!! And now he has even more basely attacked the Left for the Begründung des Referen-dums**** (we shall send it to you) and drawn up a “mid-way”, “Centrist” resolution.
Have you got the Zurich Volksrecht, or can you get it?? If not, we shall, send you something, or try to.

They write that the mood of the masses is a good one, that chauvinism is clearly declining and that probably our day will come.
The organisation, they say, is suffering from the fact that the adults are at the front, while in the factories there are young people and women.
But the fighting spirit, they say, is not any the less.
They send us the copy of a leaflet (a good one) issued by the Mos-cow Bureau of the Central Committee.

Iv.
Bukharin (who, how-ever, is not right all the same, though nearer to the truth than Kautsky).
I would terribly much like to write about this: perhaps publish No.

Nadya is ill: she has caught bronchitis and has a tem-perature.
It looks as though she will be in bed for some time.
I called in the doctor today.
Well, and what about your visit to La Chaux-de-Fonds? Have you given up this idea altogether, and all your plans about work in French Switzerland? You should not let that drop.
Things here, as I wrote, are not very good, yet today we have finished leaflet No.
1 281 (“the Swiss group of Zimmerwald Lefts”).
We shall see what happens! If not now, then in general (i.
e.
, a little later) we shall succeed (I am sure)—if not we, then our successors—in building up a Left trend in Switzerland.
The ground for this exists! Have you read the propositions of the Left at the Con-gress of the Zurich cantonal party at Töss, 282 February 11, 1917? in Volksrecht? Not bad all the same, eh? All the very best greetings and handshakes.
Excuse the scribble on the last page: I am being hurried.
Yours, Lenin Written between February 1 9 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Clarens First published in 1 9 4 9 in Bolshevik No.
1 Printed from the original125 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI March 5, 1917 Dear A.
M.
, Newspaper reports speak of a congress of the Young being called in Sweden on May 12 to found a new party “on Zimmerwald principles”.
I must admit that this news particularly disturbs and angers me.
For “Zimmerwald” is clearly bankrupt, and a good word is once again serving to cover up decay! The Zimmerwald majority—Turati and Co.
, Kautsky and Ledebour, Merrheim—have all gone over to the position of social-pacifism, condemned so solemnly (and so fruit-lessly!) at Kienthal.
The manifesto of Kautsky and Co.
of January 7, 1917, a number of resolutions of the Italian Socialist Party, the resolutions of Merrheim-Jouhaux and Longuet-Bourderon (& Raffin-Dugens in unity with Re-naudel), is not this the bankruptcy of Zimmerwald? And the Zimmerwald “Centre”—R.
Grimm, who on January 7, 1917 entered into an alliance with the social-patriots of Switzerland to fight the Left!! Grimm, who abuses the social-patriots of all countries except the Swiss, whom he covers up! C’est dégoûtant! * I am beside myself with fury at these scoundrels; it is revolting to listen to them and to hear about them; it is even more revolting to think of working with them.
Buffoonery! We intend to collect material for you about this bank-ruptcy of R.
Grimm.
Write whether you can get the Zurich Volksrecht.
You will find the principal material there in * It is disgusting!—Ed.
the preamble to the referendum, in the resolution of the Left at Töss (February 11, 1917), etc.
, etc.
But the majority of the Swedish Left, I am sure, are sincere.
This is clear.
And it is necessary at all costs to help them before May 12 to understand beforehand the utter banality of social-pacifism and Kautskianism, all the vileness of the Zimmerwald majority, to help them work out a good programme and tactics for themselves, for the new party.
Really, we must (all of its, the Left in Sweden and those who can get into touch with them) unite, bend every effort, help—for the moment in the life of the Swedish party, the Swedish and Scandinavian labour movement, is a decisive one.
Since you read Swedish (and speak it too), a considerable share of responsibility falls on you, if we understand “internationalism” not in the sense of “it’s no concern of mine”.
I am sure you are doing a great deal.
One would like to rally and unite the Lefts to help the Swedes at such a dif-ficult moment in their life.
Could not one organise in Chris-tiania, Copenhagen and Stockholm for this purpose a group of Russian Bolsheviks and Lefts who know Swedish and can help? The work could be divided: to collect the main documents and articles (I was sent the polemic between Norman and Mauritz Västberg in Politiken of November 28, 1916 on the theme, “first a programme, then a new party”— but I could not understand it); to work out one’s own theses to help them; to print a number of articles to aid them.
Swedes able to write in German, French or English could also enter such a group.
* What is your opinion, is this possible or not? Is it worth while worrying with it? My opinion is that it is worth while, but of course I am not in a position to judge from far away, outside.
I only see and know in the firmest way possible that the question of the programme and tactics of a new socialism, genuinely revolutionary Marxism and not rotten Kautskianism, is * What sort of a figure is Lindhagen? “S.
R.
”? “Narodnik”? “Radical-socialist”? Hervé?on the agenda everywhere.
This is clear both from the S.
L.
P.
and The Internationalist in America, and from the data about Germany (the resolutions of the Lefts, January 7, 1917) and about France (the pamphlet of the Lefts in Paris, Les socialistes de Zimmerwald et la guerre * ), and so on.
In Denmark Trier and others would, I am sure, join in the cause of setting up a new, Marxist, party in Scandi-navia; part of the Norwegian Lefts also.
The struggle with Branting and Co.
is a serious business: necessity must force them to take a more serious attitude to questions of the theory and tactics of revolutionary Marxism.
In my opinion, the work of preparing for May 12 should be pushed intensively, and from three sides simultaneously: (1) the assistance group mentioned earlier; (2) groups of the Scandinavian Lefts: write an article (in the Swedish papers) about the necessity of founding at once such groups to prepare a programme and tactics for May 12.
(3)—the third interests me particularly, not because it is the most important (initiative from within is more important), but because we can help here.
If, for example, you were immediately, after looking through the main literature of the Left and Right in Sweden, to rough out on the basis of it theses on these lines: theoretical (programme) and practical (tactical) differ-ences defence of the fatherland; conception of imperialism; character of the war; disarmament; social-pacifism; P the nationalities question; & N revolution; dicta-torship N “mass actions”; M civil war; of the N prole-N attitude to trade unions; tariat Q opportunism and struggle against it, etc.
Every thesis should include (a) what has been said about it (“the essence”) by the Left in Sweden; (b) by the Right there.
* The Socialists of Zimmerwald and the War.
—Ed.
On this basis, taking account of the position of the Left in Russia, Germany and America (the main countries in this respect), we could work out our own theses and, by publishing them in Swedish, help the Swedes to make pre-parations for May 12.
Some of the main points from the most important reso-lutions and articles of the Right and the Left wing in Swe-den ought for this purpose to be translated into Russian or German or French or English.
In essence, morally and politically, we are all respon-sible for the Swedish Young and must help them.
You are in an exceptionally favourable position to give such aid.
Write at once what you think about it.
It would be useful, probably, to send this letter on to Lyudmila also, together with your views.
All the very best.
I wish you every success.
Yours, Lenin Sent from Zurich to Christiania (Oslo) First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany II Printed from the original126 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I enclose the leaflet and my best congratulations on it.
Don’t give it to anyone as yet: it would be a good thing if no one knew that it comes partly from the Russians.
May not Usiyevich or someone near him have blabbed? Let the distribution be made by the Swiss groups.
We here in Zurich are in a state of agitation today: there is a telegram in Zürcher Post and in Neue Zürcher Zeitung of March 15 that in Russia the revolution was victorious in Petrograd on March 14 after three days of struggle, that 12 members of the Duma are in power and the ministers have all been arrested.
If the Germans are not lying, then it’s true.
That Russia has for the last few days been on the eve of revolution is beyond doubt.
I am beside myself that I cannot go to Scandinavia!! I will not forgive myself for not risking the journey in 1915! Best greetings.
Yours, Lenin Written on March 1 5 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Clarens Published for the first time in the Fourth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original127 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI March 16, 1917 Dear A.
M.
, We have just received the second set of government telegrams about the revolution of March 1 (14) in Petrograd.
A week of bloody battles by the workers—and Milyukov & Guchkov & Kerensky 283 in power!! On the “old” European pattern.
.
.
.
Well, what of it! This “first stage of the first revolution (among those engendered by the war)” will not be the last, nor will it be only Russian.
Of course, we shall continue to be against defence of the fatherland, against the imperialist slaughter controlled by Shingaryov 2 8 4 & Kerensky and Co.
All our watchwords remain the same.
In the last issue of Sotsial-Demokrat we actually spoke of the possibility of a government “of Milyukov and Guchkov, if not of Milyukov and Kerensky”.
* It turned out that it was both .
.
.
and: all three together.
Lovely! We shall see how the party of people’s freedom (after all, it’s in a majority in the new ministry, since Konovalov 285 is even just a little “more Left”, while Kerensky is certainly more Left!) will give the people freedom, bread and peace.
.
.
.
We shall see! The main thing now is the press and the organisation of the workers in a revolutionary Social-Democratic party.
Chkhenkeli 286 must now (he promised!) provide funds for “defence of the fatherland”.
While Mr.
Chkheidze, although he did utter ultra-Left speeches during the revolution or on its eve (when Yefremov, too, spoke in no less * See “A Turn in World Politics” (present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
262-70).
—Ed.
rrrevolutionary fashion), of course, does not deserve one atom of confidence after all his “politics” with Potresov and Co.
, with Chkhenkeli, etc.
It would be the greatest misfortune if the Cadets were now to promise a legal workers’ party, and if our people accepted “unity” with Chkheidze and Co.
!! But this will not happen.
First, the Cadets will not allow’ anyone a legal workers’ party except the Potresovs and Co.
Secondly, if they do allow it, we shall set up as before our own separate party and without fail combine legal work with illegal.
On no account a repetition of something like the Second International! On no account with Kautsky! Definitely a more revolutionary programme and tactics (there are ele-ments of it in K.
Liebknecht, the S.
L.
P.
in America, the Dutch Marxists, etc.
) and definitely the combination of legal and illegal work.
Republican propaganda, the struggle against imperialism, as before revolutionary propaganda, agitation and struggle with the aim of an internation-al proletarian revolution and the conquest of power by the “Soviets of Workers’ Deputies” (and not the Cadet swindlers).
.
.
.
After the “great rebellion” of 1905—the “glorious revolution” * of 1917!.
.
.
Be so kind as to forward this letter to Lyudmila, and drop me a line as to how far we are in agreement, or how far we differ, and also as to the plans of A.
M.

If our deputies 2 8 7 are allowed to return, one must definitely be brought for a couple of weeks to Scandinavia.

128 TO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI March 17, 1917 Dear A.
M.
, I have just had your telegram, worded so that it sounds almost ironical (just imagine thinking about “directives” from here, when news is exceptionally meagre, while in Petersburg there are probably not only effectively leading comrades of our Party, but also formally commissioned representatives of the Central Committee!).
Only just this minute I have read the telegram of the Peters-burg Telegraph Agency of the 17th giving the programme of the new government, and the news about Bonar Law’s statement that the tsar has not yet abdicated and that no one knows where he is.
Yesterday it seemed that the Guchkov-Milyukov govern-ment was already completely victorious and had already come to an agreement with the dynasty.
Today the situa-tion is that the dynasty does not exist and the tsar has fled, clearly preparing for a counter-revolution!.
.
.
We have begun working out theses which we shall per-haps finish this evening and then, naturally, will immediate-ly forward to you.
If possible, wait for these theses, which correct (resp.
cancel) what I am writing now in my own name only, so far.
—Zinoviev and I have just managed to draw up a first draft of the theses, a rough one, very unsatisfactory in the editorial sense (of course, we shall not print it in this form) but giving, I hope, an idea of the main point.
We earnestly ask you to acquaint Yuri and Eug.
B.
with it, and also Lyudmila, and likewise to drop us at least aline or two before you leave * —and also make certain to arrange with someone who is staying in Norway to forward our material to Russia and Russian material to us.
Please do this, and ask this comrade remaining behind (or a Nor-wegian comrade who knows German, French or English) to be exceptionally efficient.
We shall send money for the expenses.
In my opinion, the main thing now is not to let oneself get entangled in stupid “unification” attempts with the social-patriots (or, what is still more dangerous, with the wobblers like the Organising Committee, Trotsky and Co.
) and to continue the work of our Party in a consistently internationalist spirit.
What is now on the agenda is expansion of the work, organisation of the masses, awakening of new sections—the backward, the rural, domestic servants—Party cells in the forces for systematic and detailed Entlarvung** of the new government, and preparation for the conquest of power by the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies.
Only such a power can give bread, peace and liberty.
What is needed today is to finish off the reactionaries, not a shadow of confidence or support for the new government (not a shadow of confidence in Kerensky, Gvozdyov, 2 8 8 Chkhenkeli, Chkheidze 2 8 9 and Co.
) and armed temporising, armed preparation of a wider base for a higher stage.
If there is freedom of the press, republish (as material for the history of the recent past) our writings here, and inform us by cable whether we can help by writing from here through Scandinavia.
We are afraid that it will be some time before we succeed in leaving accursed Switzer-land.
All the best.

I am afraid that there will now be an epidemic in Petersburg “simply” of excitement, without systematic work on a party of a new type.

Al.

* The following is an absolute secret.
Please reply to me immediate-ly and, perhaps, best by express (I think we won’t ruin the Party by a dozen extra express letters), so that I can be sure no one has read the letter.
Take out papers in your own name for travelling to France and England, and I will use them to travel through England (and Holland) to Russia.
I can put on a wig.
The photograph will be taken of me with the wig on, and I shall go to the Consulate in Berne with your papers and wearing the wig.
You must then disappear from Geneva for a minimum of a few weeks (until my telegram arrives from Scandinavia): for this period you must hide yourself well away in the mountains, where, we shall, of course, pay for your board and lodging.
If you agree, begin preparations immediately in the most energetic (and most secret) fashion, and drop me a line at once in any case.
Yours, Lenin Think over all the practical steps involved and write to me in detail.
I am writing to you because I am convinced that between us everything will remain absolutely secret.

KARPINSKY Dear Comrade, I have sent you (through Inessa) copies of two of my articles for Pravda—for information, to co-ordinate our views.
I need them back on Monday: if necessary, send them express and take them to the station.
Be careful about blocs with the Nachalo 2 9 0 people: we are against rapprochement with other parties, are for warn-ing the workers against Chkheidze.
Essential! Chkheidze is clearly wobbling: cf.
how he is being praised in the Temps of March 22 and in many other papers.
We are for the C.

LUNACHARSKY 291 Dear Comrade Anatoly Vasilyevich, As regards a conference, my personal opinion (I am send-ing on your letter to Zinoviev) is that it is expedient now only between people who are ready to warn the proletariat not only against the Gvozdyov supporters, 292 but also against the waverings of Chkheidze.
In this, I believe, is the essence of our inner-Party and, if one may use the term, near-Party situation.
It is just for this reason that I am not wasting time on a single conference with Martov and Co.
Independence and separateness of our Party, no rapproche-ment with other parties, are indispensable conditions for me.
Without this one cannot help the proletariat to move through the democratic revolution to the commune, and I would not serve any other ends.
I personally would be for a conference with people and groups who agree on this basic point.
I should be very glad to have a talk with you, without any formal conferences, and should consider it valuable for myself personally (and for the cause).
With all my heart I congratulate you, too, and shake your hand, and send greetings as well from N.
K.
to you both.

KARPINSKY Dear Comrade, I have sent you through Inessa copies of my two letters to Pravda.
I hope you have done what I asked, and today (Sunday) or tomorrow have sent them back to me by express.
After Tuesday (I am lecturing here oil Tuesday evening) I will send you a copy of letter No.

* Then I think, it will be easy for us to come to an agreement about tactics.
Lunacharsky has written to me proposing a “conference”.
I have replied: I am agreeable to having a talk with you (Lunacharsky) personally.
** (He will be coming to Zurich.
) I am agreeable to a conference, however, only on condition that the workers are warned against the waverings of Chkhe-idze.
He (Lunacharsky) has said nothing.
So it means that we shall confine ourselves to a personal talk.
Chkheidze is obviously wobbling: cf.
Le Temps of March 22 praises Chkheidze, while on March 24 it abuses him.
The picture is clear!! Therefore I am a little afraid that you have been in too much of a hurry to draw up a general resolution 293 (I have sent it to Pravda today, together with my article, addressed to Herrn Fürstenberg, Boulevard Hotel, Kristiania.
You can send articles there, with a note that the articles are for Pravda, and that I supplied the address; as to articles on questions of principle, it would he useful for us to reacts preliminary agreement).

Pravda, probably, needs articles.
At any rate I am writ-ing, and I am advising all friends to write.
I fear that you are too much in a hurry also to unite with the Vperyod group.
In your resolution the ending is good (I had time only to look through it rapidly: it had to go off), but the beginning (about democracy in general) seemed to me very bad.
As regards unity with Vperyod.
I sent a telegram to Scan-dinavia to the members of our Party who are leaving: “Notre tactique: méfiance absolue, aucun soutien nouveau gouvernement, Kerensky surtout soupçonnons, armement prolétariat seule garantie, élection immédiate douma de Petrograd aucun rapprochement autres partis.
” * The last is conditio sine qua non.
We don’t trust Chkheidze.
Our deputies and Kamenev are already in Petersburg, or will be there in a few days.
There is a Central Committee in Petersburg (Frankfurter Zeitung printed extracts from its manifesto, lovely!), Pravda exists.
We are for preser-vation of this party absolutely, against all fusions with the Organising Committee.
(Probably there is no O.
C.
in Petersburg, since Frank-furter Zeitung and Vossische Zeitung gave a detailed ac-count of the manifesto of Chkheidze and Co.
of March 16, 294 and there is not a word about the O.
C.
there.
) It is precisely for the elections to the Constituent As-sembly (or for the overthrow of the government of Guchkov and Milyukov) that we must have a separate party, ours, which has in my opinion completely justified itself during the years 1914-17.
That means? Do the Vperyodists want honestly to join this party? Bon! They don’t want to? I won’t agree to “concessions” and “bargaining”.
* “Our tactics: absolute distrust, no support for the new govern-ment, suspect Kerensky above all, arming of the proletariat the only guarantee, immediate elections to the Petrograd Duma, no rapproche-ment with other parties.
”—Ed.
Have a talk with them, as man to man and more than once, and drop me a line, so that I have your reply by Tues-day (or at latest Wednesday morning).
Will you undertake to type in two copies (or in one copy) my manuscript * of 500 pages (written on octavo), for pay-ment not less than last time? I would then publish it, at once in Petersburg.

133 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, You must be in an excessively nervous state.
This is my explanation for a number of theoretical “oddities” in your letters.
We should not distinguish the first and the second revo-lution, or the first and the second stage?? That’s just what we have to do.
Marxism requires that we should distinguish the classes which are in action.
In Russia it is not the same class as before that is in power.
Consequently, the revolution which lies ahead is quite, quite different.
My phrase about support of the workers by the Milyukovs has (it seemed to me) a clear sense; if the Milyukovs really wanted to finish off the monarchy, they should have sup-ported the workers.
Only that! One must not make a “fetish” out of revolution.
Kerensky is a revolutionary, but a chatterbox, a petty liar, a deceiver of the workers.
It is almost certain that even in the Petrograd “Soviet of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies’ the majority has been fooled by him (with the help of the wobbling and muddling Chkheidze).
And what will happen to the countryside? It is quite possible that for a time the majority both of the workers and of the peasants will really be for the imperialist war (which the Guchkovs&Milyukovs are representing as “defence of the Republic”).
It would be a good thing if someone with free time (bet-ter still a group, but if one doesn’t exist, then at least anindividual) undertook to collect all the telegrams (and articles if possible) in all the foreign newspapers about the Russian revolution.
There are mountains of material.
It is impossible to follow it all.
Probably we won’t manage to get to Russia!! Britain will not let us through.
It can’t be done through Germany.

HANECKI 295 March 30, 1917 Dear Comrade, I thank you with all my heart for the trouble you are taking and for your help.
I cannot, of course, make use of the services of people who are connected with the publish-er of Die Glocke.
2 9 6 I cabled you today that the only hope of breaking out of here is by an exchange of emigrants in Switzerland for German internees.
Britain will on no ac-count let me through, or any internationalists at all, nei-ther Martov and his friends nor Natanson and his friends.
The British sent Chernov back to France, although he had all his papers for transit!! It is clear that the Russian pro-letarian revolution has no more malignant enemy than the British imperialists.
It is clear that Milyukov (and Co.
), agents of Anglo-French imperialist capital, and Russian imperialists themselves, are capable of everything—decep-tion, treachery, and everything else—in order to prevent the internationalists returning to Russia.
The least confidence in this respect either in Milyukov or in Kerensky (an empty chatterer, an agent of the Russian imperialist bourgeoisie in his objective role) would be simply ruinous for the work-ing-class movement and for our Party, and would border on betrayal of internationalism.
The only—without exag-geration, the only—hope for us to get to Russia is to send as soon as possible a reliable person to Russia, to secure from the government, by pressure from the “Soviet of Workers’ Deputies”, an exchange of all the emigrants in Switzerland for interned Germans.
It is necessary to act with the maxi-mum energy, making a record of every step, not sparing expense on telegrams, and collecting documents against Milyukov and Co.
, who are capable of dragging matters out, feeding us with promises, swindling, etc.
You can imagine what torture it is for all of us to be sitting here at such a time.
Furthermore, the dispatch of a reliable person to Russia is still more necessary for reasons of principle.
The latest information in the foreign press gives clearer and clearer indications that the government, with the direct help of Kerensky and thanks to the (putting it mildly) unforgivable wobblings of Chkheidze, is swindling—and swindling not without success—the working class, representing the imperial-ist war as a “defensive” one.
Judging from the telegram of the St.
Petersburg Telegraph Agency of March 30, 1917.
Chkheidze has allowed himself to be completely deceived by this slogan, adopted also by the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies —if this source, generally unreliable of course, is to be believed.
At all events, even if the report is untrue, the danger of such a deception is all the same undoubtedly vast.
All the efforts of our Party must be concentrated on fighting it.
Our Party would disgrace itself for ever, commit political suicide, if it tolerated such a deception.
To judge from one report, Muranov returned from Kronstadt together with Skobelev.
If Muranov went there on behalf of the Provisional Government of the Guchkovs and Milyukovs, I very much ask you to pass on (through someone reliable), and to print, that I absolutely condemn this, that any rapprochement with those who are wobbling in the direction of social-patriotism and have taken up the profoundly mistaken, profoundly harmful social-pacifist, Kautskian, position of Chkheidze and Co.
is, I am deeply convinced, harmful for the working class, dangerous, inadmissible.
I hope you have received my “Letters from Afar” Nos.
1-4, * in which I developed the theoretical and political foun-dation for these views.
If these letters have been lost, or did not reach Petrograd, please cable me, and I will send you copies.
* See present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
295-342.
—Ed.
There is no doubt that in the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies there are numerous, even, it seems, a majority of, (1) supporters of Kerensky, a most dangerous agent of the imperialist bourgeoisie, pursuing imperial-ism, i.
e.
, the defence and justification of a plundering war of conquest on Russia’s part, under cover of an ocean of sounding phrases and empty promises, (2) supporters of Chkheidze, who is wobbling hopelessly in the direction of social-patriotism and sharing all the philistinism and stupid-ity of Kautskianism.
Our Party is obliged to carry on the most stubborn, the most highly principled, the most press-ing and most merciless struggle against both currents.
And I personally will not hesitate for a second to declare, and to declare in print, that I shall prefer even an immediate split with anyone in our Party, whoever it may be, to making con-cessions to the social-patriotism of Kerensky and Co.
or the social-pacifism and Kautskianism of Chkheidze and Co.
I must at all costs demand the republication in Petrograd —if only tinder the title: From the History of the Last Years of Tsarism—of the Sotsial-Demokrat published here, of the pamphlet by Lenin and Zinoviev on the war and socialism, 297 of Kommunist and Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
But most of all, and first of all, the theses in No.
47 of Sotsial-Demokrat (of October 13, 1915).
* These theses are now exceptionally important.
These theses say directly, clearly, precisely how we should act in a revolution in Russia, and they do it 1 2, years before the revolution.
These theses have been remarkably, literally confirmed by the revolution.
The war has not ceased, and cannot cease, to be imperial-ist on the part of Russia, so long as (1) the landowners and capitalists, representatives of the bourgeois class, are in power; (2) so long as such direct agents and servants of that bourgeoisie as Kerensky and the other social-patriots are in power; (3) so long as the treaties between tsarism and the Anglo-French imperialists remain in force (the Guchkov-Milyukov government has openly declared abroad—I don’t * Reference is to Lenin’s article “Several Theses” (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
401-04).
—Ed.
know whether it has done so in Russia—that it is loyal to these treaties).
They are robber treaties, for the seizure of Galicia, Armenia, Constantinople, etc.
, etc.
; (4) so long as these treaties have not been published and not annulled; (5) so long as the whole alliance between Russia and the Anglo-French bourgeois, imperialist governments has not been broken off altogether; (6) so long as state power in Russia has not passed from the imperialist bourgeoisie (mere promises and “pacifist” declarations, however much the stupid Kaut-sky, Chkheidze and Co.
believe in them, do not transform the bourgeoisie into a non-bourgeoisie) into the hands of the pro-letariat, which alone is capable, on condition that it is sup-ported by the poorer section of the peasantry, of breaking not merely in words but in deeds with the interests of capital, with imperialist policy, with the plundering of other coun-tries, of emancipating the peoples oppressed by the Great Russians completely, withdrawing the troops from Armenia and Galicia at once, etc.
; (7) only the proletariat is capable, if it rids itself of the influence of its national bourgeoisie, of winning the genuine confidence of the proletarians of all the belligerent countries, and entering into peace negotia-tions with them; (8) these proletarian peace terms are set forth precisely and clearly both in No.
47 of Sotsial-Demo-krat and in my letter No.
4.
Hence it is clear that the watchword: “We are now defend-ing the Republic in Russia, we are now carrying on a ‘defen-sive war’, we shall fight Wilhelm, we are fighting for the overthrow of Wilhelm” is the greatest deception, the greatest swindling of the workers!! For Guchkov-Lvov-Milyukov and Co.
are landowners and capitalists, representatives of the class of landowners and capitalists, imperialists who are fighting for the same robber ends, on the basis of the same robber treaties concluded by tsarism, in alliance with the same imperialist robber bourgeoisie of Britain, France and Italy.
The appeal to the Germans by the bourgeois and imperial-ist republic in Russia—“Overthrow Wilhelm”—is a re-petition of the lying slogan of the French social-chauvin-ists, traitors to socialism, Jules Guesde, Sembat and Co.
In a very popular way, very clearly, without learned words, it must he explained to the workers and soldiers that it isnot only Wilhelm who has to he overthrown, but also the kings of Great Britain and Italy.
That is first of all.
And secondly, and most important, the bourgeois governments must be overthrown, beginning with Russia—for otherwise peace cannot be won.
It may be that we cannot immediately “overthrow” the government of Guchkov-Milyukov.
That may be so.
But that is not an argument for telling an un-truth!! The workers must be told the truth.
We have to say that the government of Guchkov-Milyukov and Co.
is an imperialist government, that the workers and peasants must first of all (now or after elections to the Constituent Assembly, if it is not used to deceive the people, if the elections are not postponed until after the war—the question of choice of moment cannot be decided from here), first of all must transfer all state power into the hands of the working class, the enemy of capital, the enemy of imperialist war, and only then will they have the right to appeal for the overthrow of all kings and all bourgeois governments.
For God’s sake try and deliver all this to Petrograd and to Pravda, to Muranov and Kamenev and the others.
For God’s sake make every effort to send this with a most relia-ble person.
It would be best of all if a reliable sensible chap like Kuba went (he would perform a great service to the whole world working-class movement) and helped our friends in Petrograd!! I hope you will do this!! Do everything in your power.
Conditions in Petrograd are exceptionally difficult.
The republican patriots are straining every effort.
They are try-ing to drown our Party in slander and dirt (the Chernoma-zov “affair”: I am sending a document about it * ), etc.
, etc.
There cannot be any confidence in Chkheidze and Co.
, or Sukhanov or Steklov and the like No rapprochement with other parties, any of them! Not a shadow of confidence in or support for the government of Guchkov-Milyukov and Co.
!!

KARPINSKY Dear Friends, And so we are leaving through Germany on Wednesday.
Tomorrow this will be finally decided.
We shall send you a mass of packages containing our books, papers and things, requesting you to forward them in turn to Stockholm for transhipment to us in Petrograd.
We shall also send you money and credentials from the Central Committee authorising you to carry on all correspondence and manage affairs.

Inessa will not have time to do the French translation: I hope you will do it and publish it (with Guilbeaux).

KARPINSKY April 12, 1917 Dear Friend, I hope that this letter will all the same reach you, and also the newspapers which are being sent to you.
I say “all the same” because the difficulties of communication with foreign countries are incredibly great.
We were allowed in, and received here with furious attacks, but up till now we have received no books, manuscripts or letters.
Evidently the military censorship is working wonderfully—even with excessive zeal, since you know, of course, that we had not even the slightest mention of the war, and could not have.
Please stop typing the agrarian manuscript, because I have found one copy here, already set.
What is missing in it is the end, the end of the “Conclusion”, 300 beginning with the words: “The whole of the peasantry and the proletariat are op-posed to the private ownership of the land.
The reformative path of creating a Junker-bourgeois Russia necessarily pre-supposes the preservation of the foundations of the old system of landownership and the slow.
.
.
.
” Now, from these words the end of the Conclusion is missing.
You will oblige me very much if from these words, and to the end of the Conclusion, you take 4-5 copies and send them (1) to me personally; (2) to Pravda, 32 Moika; (3) to Stock-holm, to the address given to you.
I ought to receive at least one of these copies.
Drop me a postcard, addressed to Pravda, or better still to M.
T.
Yelizarov (for V.
I.
), 48/9 Shirokaya, Flat 24,Petrograd, whether you have received this letter, and when you sent the copies of the end of the Conclusion.
Our journey was wonderful.
Platten was not admitted by Milyukov.
The atmosphere here is a furious campaign of the bourgeoi-sie against us.
Among the workers and soldiers—sympathy.
Among the Social-Democrats, victory of “revolutionary defencism” (now, they say, there is something to defend—the Republic, against Wilhelm).
Chkheidze and Co.
, Steklov (leaders of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies in Petrograd) have completely descended into revolutionary defencism.
Chkheidze is in a bloc with Potresov.
All are howling and screaming for “unity” of the whole Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
We, of course, are against.
On April 22, 1917 there will be an All-Russia Conference of the Bolsheviks (of our Party) in Petrograd.
301 Write me whether our “Farewell Letter” has been published, in what languages and how sales are going.
Write whether you have received the papers (I am send-ing you a file of Pravda and cuttings from various papers).
Keep Paris and all Switzerland as well informed as possible.
All the best.

9 Printed from the typewritten copy found in police records137 TO THE BUREAU OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE ABROAD August 17 (30), 1917 Dear Friends, With great difficulty, after long weeks of forced interrup-tion, it seems as though we are successfully resuming our correspondence.
Of course, to make this completely success-ful you will have to go to a lot of pains and effort to organise it at your end.
The shameful campaign of slander launched by the bour-geoisie about the alleged espionage, or connection there-with, of Hanecki, Kollontai and many others is, of course, a scoundrelly cover for the crusade against the international-ists on the part of our bold “republicans”, who want to “compare favourably” with tsarism in their slander-monger-ing.
(1) I have read somewhere in the Russian papers that Ha-necki and Radek have been publishing a denial.
302 I don’t know whether this is true.
But it is essential.
The first thing to do is for Radek to write to Paris and get the minutes of the last Paris trial of himself (by various factions of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
).
Lunacharsky, denouncing these base slan-derers, long ago described this trial in Novaya Zhizn.
303 But that is not enough.
Someone should try to get the minutes or at least the full sentence of the court, and, if it cannot be printed, take several typed copies and send them here.
If it is impossible to get the minutes or the sentence, it would he desirable to procure at least a written account of the trial by one of the Parisians who took part in it, and to publishat least a small pamphlet in Russian (there is a Russian print-ing-press in Christiania), in order to give a documentary refutation of these disgusting slanders.
It will be possible to send us at least some copies of the pamphlet, and extracts from it should appear in Arbeiterpolitik, Politiken, Demain, etc.
(2) It is equally essential that Hanecki should give a docu-mentary refutation of the slanderers, by publishing as rapidly as possible the financial accounts of his trading and his “business deals” with Sumenson (who is this lady? It’s the first time I have heard of her!) and with Kozlovsky (it is desirable that the accounts should be audited and signed by a Swedish notary or Swedish socialists, several of them, mem-bers of Parliament).
It is also necessary to publish the text of the telegrams (there has already been something in the Russian papers, in Russkaya Volya, Bez Lishnikh Slov 304 and others, but probably not in full), and to analyse and explain each.
We must fight against this shameful Dreyfus campaign, against this slandering, by publishing the pamphlet, and as quickly as possible, not sparing toil, trouble or money, in order to brand the slanderers and, as far as possible, to help those who have been arrested on this base and slan-derous charge.
(3) How are the financial affairs of the Bureau Abroad, which was appointed by our Central Committee? After the July persecutions it is clear that our C.
C.
cannot help (I think so at any rate).
Write whether you have succeeded in collecting anything through the Swedish Left, and will the Bureau manage to exist? What about the Bulletin? How many issues have been published, and in what languages? 305 Has Guilbeaux had all the issues? Have you a file of Demain? Was the Bulletin sent to America, North and South? Write about all this in as much detail as you can.
(4) By the way.
I don’t remember who informed us, but it seems that after Grimm, and independently of him, Moor appeared in Stockholm.
That the scoundrel Grimm, as a Kautskian “Centrist”, proved capable of a scoundrelly understanding with “his” minister does not surprise me: anyone who does not break resolutely with the social-chau-vinists always risks falling into this scoundrelly situation.
But what kind of man is Moor? Has it been fully and abso-lutely proved that he is an honest man? That he never had, and has not now, any direct or indirect dealings with the German social-imperialists? If it is true that Moor is in Stockholm, and if you know him, I would very, very much ask you, earnestly ask you, insistently ask you to take every step to check this up in the most strict and the most documented fashion.
There is not, or rather, should not be, any room even for a shadow of suspicion, reproach, rumour, etc.
I very much regret that the “Zimmerwald Commission” did not condemn Grimm more severely! 306 It should have been done more severely! (5) I have been, and remain, unquestionably against parti-cipation in the Stockholm Conference.
307 I must observe that I am writing all this letter personally, as from myself, since I have had no chance either to ask the C.
C.
or even communicate with it.
Therefore, in replying to me with particular detail, append to your letter your official, detailed, business-like, documentary report (of the whole Bureau) to the Central Committee, and I will send it on.
So, I am absolutely against participating in the Stockholm Conference.
I consider Kamenev’s statement 308 (have you seen Novaya Zhizn? you ought to subscribe to it) the height of stupidity, if not of baseness, and have already written about this to the Central Committee and for the press.
Luckily Kamenev was speaking only for himself, and was disavowed by another Bolshevik.
I consider participation in the Stockholm Conference, or in any other, with the Ministers (and scoundrels) Chernov, Tsereteli, Skobelev and their parties, to be direct betrayal, and will state this opinion in the press against all and sun-dry.
If in the “Zimmerwald Commission” (judging by the report of the social-chauvinist Rozanov) it proved possible almost to reject Stockholm, or to half-reject it, this is very good.
But “almost” and “half” are of no use at all, and all this “half”-social-chauvinist Zimmerwald Commission, which depends on the Italians and the Ledebourites, who de-sire “unity” with the social-chauvinists, is a most harmful institution.
(6) We are making the very greatest and unforgivable mistake in delaying or postponing the convening of a con-ference of the Left to found a Third International.
It is just now, when Zimmerwald is so shamefully wavering or obliged to be inactive, just now while there still is in Russia a legal (almost legal) internationalist party with more than 200,000 (240,000) members * (which does not exist anywhere else in the world in wartime), it is just now that we are in duty bound to call a conference of the Left, and we shall really be criminals if we are late in doing so (the Bolshevik Party in Russia is being driven more and more underground day by day).
Money for the conference will be found.
It is possible to issue several numbers of its Bulletin.
There is a centre for it in Stockholm.
There is a French “foothold” (Demain) and an English one (the “Socialist Labour Party” of Ameri-ca; its delegate Reinstein ** was recently in Petrograd and will probably be in Stockholm)—though by the way in addition to the S.
L.
P.
(the “Socialist Labour Party” of America) there is also an English foothold, Tom Mann in Britain, the minorities within the British Socialist Party, the Scottish socialists and The International in America.
It would be simply criminal to postpone now the calling of a conference of the Left.
It would be immeasurably stupid to “wait” for a “large” number of participants, and to be “embarrassed” by the fact that at present there are “few”.
For just now such a conference will be a moral force, independently of the number of participants, while later it may be hushed up.
The Bolsheviks, the P.
S.
D.
, the Dutch, Arbeiterpolitik, Demain—there is already a sufficient nucleus.
They will certainly be joined, if energetic action is taken, by part of the Danes (Trier and others, who have left the party of the scoundrel Stauning), part of the Swedish Young (against whom we are sinning, in not leading them, because they must be led), some of the Bulgarians, the Lefts in Austria (“Franz” 309 ), some of the friends of Loriot in France, part of the Lefts in Switzerland (Youth International) and in * Seventeen daily papers; 1,415,000 copies weekly altogether; 320,000 daily.
** I have no idea what sort of a bird this is.
According to the press, he greeted the “Unity Congress” of the Mensheviks!! That means he’s a suspect bird.
Italy, and then the elements in the Anglo-American move-ment which I have already mentioned.
The resolutions of the conference of the Bolsheviks (April 24-29, 1917) and of their congress (July 1917; see the resolutions in Novaya Zhizn), 3 1 0 the draft new programme of the same Party—there is a sufficient ideological basis (adding Vorbote, Tribune, Arbeiterpolitik and others) to be able to present the whole world with clear answers to the questions raised by imperialism, and to accuse the social-chauvinists and the Kautskians.
Such a conference must be called at once, its provisional Bureau must be set up, and its manifesto and draft resolu-tions printed in three languages for passing on to the parties.
I repeat once again: I am profoundly convinced that, if we do not do this now, we shall make this work terribly diffi-cult for ourselves in the future, and will terribly facilitate an “amnesty” for the traitors to socialism.
(7) The ministerialism of the Russian Menshevik-“Zimmer-waldists” must be specially utilised to put an ultima-tum to Zimmerwald in general: either a break with the Bran-tings, Huysmans and Co.
, or we walk out immediately.
By the way: is Arbeiterpolitik making a campaign against Zetkin and against the Braunschweiger Volksfreund for the way these scoundrels, pursuing their intrigues, have been whitewashing and supporting the Russian Mensheviks, Chkheidze and Co.
, who have proved ministerial swine, just like Sembat, Renaudel, Thomas and Co.
? Has Mehring, too, still not understood to this day the utter baseness of Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Skobelev and Co.
? (8) You must get your letters sent on here—I hope to receive immediately just as detailed a letter as mine (other-wise I do not agree to correspond)—and literature as well: files from the middle of June, at the very least, of Arbeiter-politik, Demain, Kampf (Duisburg), Weekly People (S.
L.
P.
), Leipziger Volkszeitung, Neue Zeit, The Call and others.
Spartacus, the publications of Loriot and his friends, Avanti!, etc.
, etc.
As a beginning, you might at least send cuttings.
(9) You should send here, if possible every week, first, articles for the provincial and Petrograd Party press (re-views of the Left-wing movement abroad, facts, facts, facts);secondly, leaflets (4-8-16 small pages) for publication as booklets.
Summaries of facts about the collapse of the International, the disgrace of the social-chauvinists, the disgrace of the Kautskians, the growth of the movement of the Left: at least 4 booklets on each of these subjects, 16-32 small pages each.
Facts and facts.
There is a hope of publishing this.
Reply at once whether you can take it on.
When sending it on by our method (there can be no question now of sending it legally) I think it is all the same which language it is written in.
(10) I hope you have the file of Pravda, and are subscrib-ing to Novaya Zhizn.
If you have not received Rabochy i Sol-dat (closed down), Proletarskoye Dyelo (Kronstadt) and Sotsial-Demokrat (Moscow), write at once, and I will send them as soon as the new method, being tested for the first time by this letter, is organised satisfactorily.

I have still not succeeded in sending off my letter, and probably won’t succeed for some time.
So this is becoming something like a diary instead of a letter! It can’t be helped.

Today I have learned from Izvestia that News of the Stockholm Information Bureau of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies is being published weekly in Stockholm.
Try to send files of all Stockholm publications.
We see nothing.
August 25 (September 7).
It looks as though tomorrow it will be possible to send this letter.
Make every effort to organ-ise delivery from your end.
Reply without fail at once, if only briefly, to the address (within your country) which the comrade delivering this letter (or his friend) communicates to you.
He will also pass on a cipher; as an experiment I am writing a few words in this cipher, and please reply to thorn in the same cipher.

This is im-poss-ible! The terrorists will consider us old women.

The detachments have been sent for responsible service on the railways, for the struggle against actual profiteering.
Chiefs of detachments are instructed to maintain the most stringent discipline in their detachments, for the absence of which, as for all offences by the detachments, the chiefs will be held to strict account before the merciless judgement of the Revolutionary Tribu-nal.
Detachments should be informed that the Council of People’s Commissars is convinced that class-conscious work-ers will not tolerate any breach of the strictest proletarian discipline, and will treat with the greatest severity those who by their behaviour are disgracing Soviet power.
But if obvious hooligans have found their way into the detachments, and refuse to obey the instructions of the central authorities and their chiefs, or disgrace the Soviet Republic by taking bribes from grain speculators, they must be immediately arrested by their chiefs and the local Soviets of Deputies, and delivered under guard to Moscow for committal to most severe judgement by the Revolutionary Tribunal.

2 2 1 , September 2 4 , 1 9 3 3 Printed from the original156 TO CLARA ZETKIN July 26, 1918 Esteemed Comrade Zetkin, Many warm thanks for your letter of June 27, which was brought me by Comrade Hertha Hordon.
I will do all I can to help Comrade Hordon.
We are all extremely glad that you, Comrade Mehring and the other “Spartacus comrades” in Germany are with us, “head and heart”.
325 This gives us confidence that the best elements of the West-European working class—in spite of all difficulties—will nevertheless come to our assistance.
We here are now living through perhaps the most difficult weeks of the whole revolution.
The class struggle and the civil war have penetrated deep among the population: every-where there is a split in the villages—the poor are for us, the kulaks are furiously against us.
The Entente has bought the Czechoslovaks, a counter-revolutionary revolt is raging, the bourgeoisie is making every effort to overthrow us.
Nevertheless, we firmly believe that we shall escape this “usual” (as in 1794 and 1849) course of the revolution, and will conquer the bourgeoisie.
With great gratitude, very best greetings and sincere respect, Yours, Lenin P.

TSYURUPA 328 In view of the critical food situation, we must not scatter our forces.
We must concentrate them in one place, where it is possible to secure a lot of grain.
I suggest that forces be concentrated in Yelets Uyezd where, according to a number of reports and on the evidence of the People’s Commissar for the Interior Pravdin, who inspected this area, the state of affairs, in the sense of the throttling of the kulaks and the organisation of the poor peasants, is a model one.
Send immediately, with the maximum speed, all the food, harvesting and harvest-requisitioning detachments to Yelets Uyezd, with the maximum number of threshers and attachments (if possible) for rapid drying of the grain, etc.
Give them the task of clearing the uyezd of grain surpluses completely.
Probably this will yield several million poods of grain (in my opinion, more than 6 million poods).
First send the maximum forces to those 12 (out of 21) volosts of the uyezd where, according to the local people, the organisation of the poor peasants is best, and parti-cularly to the former landed estates which have been registered.
Don’t be niggardly with bonuses for rapid harvesting and delivery of grain, assign for this purpose up to 30 million rubles immediately (grant bonuses to volosts and villages in the shape of machinery, grants for schools and hospitals and, in general, mainly for such purposes).
The maximumbonuses must be given for delivery of all surpluses of grain, medium bonuses for big deliveries in general, and so forth.
Among the workers of the famine-stricken gubernias (and among the famine-stricken peasants there also) develop mass agitation: crusade for grain to Yelets Uyezd! Written on August 5 , 1 9 1 8 First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin Miscellany XVIII Printed from the original159 TELEGRAM TO N.

FYODOROV August 9, 1918 Comrade Fyodorov, It is obvious that a whiteguard insurrection is being pre-pared in Nizhni.
You must strain every effort, appoint three men with dictatorial powers (yourself, Markin and one other), organise immediately mass terror, shoot and deport the hundreds of prostitutes who are making drunkards of the soldiers, former officers and the like.
Not a minute of delay.

There is no bust of Marx on public display, nothing has been done in the way of propaganda by putting up inscriptions in the streets.

JOFFE September 20, 1918 Dear Comrades, Today’s Pravda has quoted extracts from Kautsky’s article against Bolshevism (from Sozialistische Auslands-politik).
332 Kautsky’s disgraceful rubbish, childish babble and shallowest opportunism impel me to ask: why do we do nothing to fight the theoretical vulgarisation of Marxism by Kautsky? Can we tolerate that even such people as Mehring and Zetkin keep away from Kautsky more “morally” (if one may put it so) than theoretically.
.
.
.
Kautsky has found nothing better to do now than to write against the Bolshe-viks, they say.
Is that an argument? Can one really so weaken one’s own position? Why, that is only putting a weapon into Kautsky’s hands!! And this instead of writing: Kautsky has absolutely failed to understand and has distort-ed in a purely opportunist way the teaching of Marx on the state on the dictatorship of the ” ” ” ” proletariat on bourgeois democracy, ” ” ” ” on parliamentarism ” ” ” ” on the role and signifi-” ” ” ” cance of the Commune, etc.
We ought to take these measures: (1) have a detailed talk with the Left (Spartacists and others), stimulating them to make a statement of principle,of theory, in the press, that on the question of dictatorship Kautsky is producing philistine Bernsteinism, not Marxism; (2) publish as soon as possible in German my The State and Revolution; (3) provide it with at least a publisher’s foreword, as for example: “The publisher considers the appearance of this booklet particularly essential at the present moment, in view of the complete distortion of Marxism, precisely on these questions, in the latest works of Kautsky, who is replacing the viewpoint of the dictatorship of the proletariat by philistine social-liberalism in the spirit of Bernstein and other opportunists.
” (4) If it is impossible to publish the booklet quickly, then get a note similar to the “publisher’s foreword” in the newspapers (of the Left).
I would very much ask you to send (especially addressed to me) Kautsky’s pamphlet (about the Bolsheviks, dicta-torship, etc.
) as soon as it appears— 333 —and then to collect for me all Kautsky’s articles about the Bolsheviks (“Democracy and Dictatorship”, the end of 1917 or the beginning of 1918; then the article from Sozialistische Auslandspolitik, August 1918) and other arti-cles, if there were any.

And so forth.
) A resolution to be adopted.
The international revolution has come so close in one week that it has to be reckoned with as an event of the next few days.
No alliances either with the government of Wilhelm, or with the government of Wilhelm II&Ebert and the other scoundrels.
But for the German worker masses, the German working people in their millions, once they have begun with their spirit of revolt (so far only a spirit), we are beginning to prepare a fraternal alliance, bread, military aid.
We are all ready to die to help the German workers advance the revolution which has begun in GermanyThe conclusion: (1) ten times more effort to secure grain (clean out all stocks both for our-selves and for the German workers).
(2) Ten times more enrolments for the army.
We must have by the spring an army of three millions to help the international workers’ revolution.
This resolution should go out to the whole world by cable on Wednesday night.
Appoint the meeting for 2 p.
m.
on Wednesday.
We shall begin at 4, give me the platform for 1/4 hour of introduction, I shall drive up and leave immediately afterwards.
Send the car for me tomorrow morning (but by telephone say only: agreed).
334 Greetings! Lenin First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXI Printed from the original175 TELEGRAM ON THE OCCASION OF THE CAPTURE OF SAMARA Samara has been captured.
The Volga is free.
It would be criminal not to make use of the few days remaining before navigation closes.
It is essential to strain every effort to deliver the maximum quantity of oil and food cargoes to the upper reaches of the Volga.
This task cannot be performed without the strictest centralisation of all measures, and the precise fulfilment in the localities of orders from the centre.
Taking this into account, the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars resolves, and orders the fulfil-ment without fail: (1) All vessels, rafts, etc.
, commandeered by various or-ganisations shall be returned immediately to the Central Inland Waterways Board and the Central Oil Board res-pectively.
(This does not apply to the vessels and floating transport already included in the Volga Military Flotilla.
) (2) The right of requisitioning vessels, rafts, etc.
, on the Volga, previously granted to various organisations, insti-tutions and individuals, is annulled.
The requisitioning of floating means of transport required for military pur-poses shall henceforth take place on each occasion only by special permission of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic.
(3) All Commanders of Fronts, Extraordinary Commis-sions and Soviets shall immediately take the most stringent measures to ensure the unhindered movement of vessels and the protection of cargoes against any seizures and delays whatsoever.
(4) The control of the entire Volga tanker fleet and all oil cargoes on the Volga is vested exclusively in the Cen-tral Oil Board.
(Telegraphic address: Glavkoneft, Moscow.
) All authorities, including the military and Front Command-ers, are instructed to carry out without question all deci-sions of the Central Oil Board concerning the movement of oil cargoes, and decisions of the Central Inland Waterways Board concerning vessels.
(5) The direct control of oil cargoes along the Whole Volga is vested in Comrade Tarvid, member of the Colle-gium of the Central Oil Board.
All his instructions, and likewise those of his agents, regarding oil are absolutely binding on all authorities.
(6) All decisions as to requisitioning or prohibition of dispatch of oil, etc.
, published up to this day, remain in force only insofar as they do not contradict the instruc-tions of the Central Oil Board.
(7) Most strictly confirming the aforesaid, the Council of People’s Commissars has decided to prosecute before military-revolutionary courts all who infringe the present decision, without regard to their posts or their Party member-ship.
Agents of the Central Oil Board, the Central Inland Waterways Board and the Commissariat of Food in the localities are instructed to report to Moscow urgently all actions by local authorities which interfere with the planned work of these centres.
Extraordinary Commissions will be dispatched immediately to try the guilty and carry out the sentences.
(8) The content of the present decision of the Council of People’s Commissars is to be made known to all local executive bodies and persons in official positions.

Lenin, collated with the newspaper text176 TO THE PRESIDIUM OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET OF WORKERS AND RED ARMY DEPUTIES 335 Dear Comrades, I have received your paper numbered 24962 with an extract from the resolution of the Presidium of October 7.
In all conscience I must say that this resolution is so politically illiterate and so stupid that it makes one sick.
“.
.
.
The Presidium is obliged to disclaim responsibility.
.
.
.
” That is how capricious young ladies behave, not grown-up politi-cians.
You will not free yourselves of responsibility, but increase it threefold.
If the Commissariat of Public Education does not reply to you and does not fulfil its duty towards you, then you are obliged to complain, and with documents.
You are not children, are you, that you can’t understand this? When did you complain? Where is the copy? Where are the documents and the proofs? Both the whole Presidium and Vinogradov, in my opinion, ought to be sent to prison for a week for inactivity.
If the Commissariat of Public Education “does not produce the busts” (when did you demand them? From whom? The copy and the document? When did you com-plain?), you should have fought for your rights.
But “to disclaim responsibility” is the way of capricious young ladies and stupid Russian intellectuals.
Forgive this frank expression of my opinion, and accept communist greetings from one who hopes that you will get your lesson in prison for inaction in authority, and from one who is profoundly indignant at your behaviour.

October 1918177 TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SPARTACUS GROUP 336 October 18, 1918 Dear Comrades, We have had news today that the Spartacus group, together with the Bremen Left Radicals, 337 has taken the most energetic steps to promote the setting up of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Councils throughout Germany.
I take this opportunity to send our best wishes to the German revolu-tionary internationalist Social-Democrats.
The work of the German Spartacus group, which has carried on systematic revolutionary propaganda in the most difficult conditions, has really saved the honour of German socialism and the German proletariat.
Now the decisive hour is at hand: the rapidly maturing German revolution calls on the Spartacus group to play the most important role, and we all firmly hope that before long the German socialist proletarian republic will inflict a decisive blow on world imperialism.
I hope that the book by the renegade Kautsky against the dictatorship of the proletariat will also bring certain benefits.
It will prove the correctness of what the Spartacus group always said against the Kautskians, and the masses will the more quickly be freed from the corrupting influ-ence of Mr.
Kautsky and Co.
With best greetings and firm hopes that in the very near future it will be possible to hail the victory of the proletarian revolution in Germany.
Yours, N.

340 All this causes dislocation of supply and upsets the organisa-tion of the Soviet Republic’s rear.
The present is an instruc-tion immediately to cease attempts to infringe and evade the decree of November 21, to restore the closed and na-tionalised co-operatives, to return their goods, and without fail to include the co-operatives in the distributive system, on an equal footing with state shops.
The co-operative machinery should be made use of in all possible ways in the business of purchasing supplies and distribution, and representatives of the co-operative movement should be drawn into co-operative commissions of the food supply organisations.
Infringement and evasion of the decree will be punished.

TROTSKY Urgent Trotsky, Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic Kursk (or present whereabouts) The operations report of the Chief of Staff of the Cau-casus Front No.
4873 shows that the Krasnov troops have occupied Raigorod, on the banks of the Volga south of Sarepta, threatening in the first place our military freight moving from Vladimirovka to Tsaritsyn, and secondly the safety of the line from Astrakhan to Saratov.
Please take steps.
The same operations report shows that a British fleet of four vessels bombarded Staroterechnaya, south of Astrakhan, set fire to two of our barges and withdrew to sea unscathed, seizing our hospital ship Alesker with medical staff on board.
Where is our fleet and what is it doing? Lenin Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars Written on January 2 or 3 , 1 9 1 9 First published in Pravda No.

SOKOLNIKOV In code Sokolnikov I am extremely worried by the slowing down of opera-tions against the Donets coalfields and Rostov.
There must be a speed-up but, of course, only with substantial forces.
Work out practical directives for this purpose, and we shall get them adopted by the Central Committee for the Ukrai-nians, and equally for our own people.
It is a crying scan-dal that the suppression of the Cossack rising is dragging on.

ANTONOV-OVSEYENKO In code Antonov, Kiev Copies to Podvoisky and Rakovsky Sokolnikov cables me that Denikin has magnificently taken advantage of the interlude in the Donets coalfields, fortified himself and gathered fresher forces than ours.
The peril is a tremendous one.
The Ukraine is bound to recog-nise the Donets Basin Front as unquestionably the most important Ukrainian front, and at all costs to begin immediately carrying out the directive of the Commander-in-Chief to provide solid reinforcements for the sector Donets-Mariupol.
From Podvoisky’s information I see that there is a mass of war materiel in the Ukraine, even without counting Odessa.
It should not be hoarded, and both Donets workers and new units should be formed to take Taganrog and Rostov.
Have you mobilised all the officers in the Ukraine? At all costs the forces against Denikin must be rapidly and considerably increased.
Cable in as much detail as possible, and make your cipher clerks do their ciphering more carefully, so that everything can be understood.

The most serious attention must be given to this.
Political workers and all others, whoever they may be, should be absolutely forbidden to leave the army before the Urals have been occupied, and before they have been replaced by double the number of Urals workers; and then at all costs you should secure mobilisation en masse in the front-line area and replace the tired units by fresh forces, if only for a temporary rest, because the offensive against the Urals must not be weakened, it must definitely be intensified, speeded up, strengthened with reinforcements.

7 5 , March 2 9 , 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original218 TO MAXIM GORKY July 31, 1919 Dear Alexei Maximych, The more I read over your letter, and the more I think of the connection between its conclusions and what it sets forth (and what you described at our meetings), the more I arrive at the conviction that the letter, and your conclu-sions, and all your impressions, are quite sick.
Petrograd has been one of the sickest places in recent times.
This is quite understandable, since its population has suffered most of all, the workers have given up more of their best forces than anyone else, the food shortage is grave, and the military danger too.
Obviously your nerves can’t stand it.
That is not surprising.
Yet you won’t listen when you are told that you ought to change your abode, because to let oneself flog the nerves to a state of sickness is very unwise, unwise even from the plain common-sense point of view, not to speak of other points of view.
Just as in your conversations, there is in your letter a sum of sick impressions, leading you to sick conclusions.
You begin with dysentery and cholera, and immediately a kind of sick resentment comes over you: “fraternity, equality”.
Unconscious, but the result is something like communism being responsible for the privations, poverty and diseases of a besieged city!! Then follow some bitter witticisms, which I don’t under-stand, against “hoarding” literature (which? why connected with Kalinin?).
And the conclusion that a “wretchedremainder of the intelligent workers” say that they have been “betrayed” into “captivity to the muzhik”.
That, now, has no sense in it at all.
Is it Kalinin who is being accused of betraying the workers to the muzhik? That is what it amounts to.
This might be invented by workers who are either quite green, stupid, with a “Left” phrase instead of a brain, or else by those who are overwrought, exhausted, hungry, sick, or else by the “remainder of the aristocracy” who have a splendid ability to distort everything, a splendid gift for picking on every trifle to vent their frenzied hatred of Soviet power.
You yourself mention this remainder at the same point in your letter.
Their state of mind is having an unhealthy influence on you.
You write that you see “people of the most varied sec-tions of society”.
It’s one thing to see them, another thing to feel daily contact with them, in all aspects of one’s life.
What you mainly experience is from the “remainder”—if only by virtue of your profession, which obliges you to “receive” dozens of embittered bourgeois intellectuals, and also by virtue of your general circumstances.
As though the “remainder” cherish “something bordering on sympathy for Soviet power”, while “the majority of the workers” produce thieves, “Communists” who have jumped on the band-waggon, etc.
! And you talk yourself into the “conclusion” that a revolution cannot he made with the help of thieves, cannot be made without the intelligentsia.
This is a completely sick psychology, acutely aggravated in the environment of embittered bourgeois intellectuals.
Everything is being done to draw the intelligentsia (the non-whiteguard intelligentsia) into the struggle against the thieves.
And month by month the Soviet Republic acquires a growing percentage of bourgeois intellectuals who are sincerely helping the workers and peasants, not merely grumbling and spitting fury.
This cannot be “seen” in Petrograd, because Petrograd is a city with an exception-ally large number of bourgeois people (and “intelli-gentsia”) who have lost their place in life (and their heads), but for all Russia this is an unquestionable fact.
In Petrograd, or from Petrograd, one can only become convinced of this if one is exceptionally well informedpolitically and has a specially wide political experience.
This you haven’t got.
And you are engaged, not in politics and not in observing the work of political construction, but in a particular profession, which surrounds you with embittered bourgeois intellectuals, who have understood nothing, forgotten nothing, learned nothing and at best—a very rare best—have lost their bearings, are in despair, moaning, repeating old prejudices, have been frightened to death or are frightening themselves to death.
If you want to observe, you must observe from below, where it is possible to survey the work of building a new life, in a workers’ settlement in the provinces or in the coun-tryside.
There one does not have to make a political sum-ming-up of extremely complex data, there one need only observe.
Instead of this, you have put yourself in the posi-tion of a professional editor of translations, etc.
, a posi-tion in which it is impossible to observe the new building of a new life, a position in which all your strength is frit-tered away on the sick grumbling of a sick intelligentsia, on observing the “former” capital * in conditions of des-perate military peril and fierce privations.
You have put yourself in a position in which you cannot directly observe the new features in the life of the workers and peasants, i.

, nine-tenths of the population of Russia; in which you are compelled to observe the fragments of life of a former capital, from where the flower of the workers has gone to the fronts and to the countryside, and where there remain a disproportionately large number of intellec-tuals without a place in life and without jobs, who specially “besiege” you.
Counsels to go away you stubbornly reject.
Quite understandably, you have reduced yourself to a condition of sickness: you write that you find life not only hard, but also “extremely revolting”!!! I should say so! At such a time to chain oneself to the sickest of places as an editor of translated literature (the most suitable occu-pation for observing people, for an artist!).
As an artist, you cannot see and study anything there that is new—in the army, in the countryside, in the factory.
You have * Petrograd.
In March 1918 the capital was transferred to Mos-cow.
—Ed.
deprived yourself of any opportunity of doing what would satisfy the artist: in Petrograd a politician can work, but you are not a politician.
Today it’s windows being broken for no reason at all, tomorrow it’s shots and screams from prison, then snatches of oratory by the most weary of the non-workers who have remained in Petrograd, then millions of impressions from the intelligentsia, the intelligentsia of a capital which is no longer a capital, then hundreds of complaints from those who have been wronged, inability to see any building of the new life in the time you have left after editing (the building goes on in a particular way, and least of all in Petrograd)—how could you fail to reduce yourself to a point when it is extremely revolting to go on living? The country is living in a feverish struggle against the bourgeoisie of the whole world, which is taking a frenzied revenge for its overthrow.
Naturally.
For the first Soviet Republic, the first blows from everywhere.
Naturally.
Here one must live either as an active politician or (if one’s heart does not draw one to politics), as an artist, observe how people are building life anew somewhere that is not, as the capital is, the centre of furious attack, of a furious struggle against conspiracies, of the furious anger of the capital’s intelligentsia—somewhere in the countryside, or in a provincial factory (or at the front).
There it is easy, merely by observing, to distinguish the decomposition of the old from the first shoots of the new.
Life has become revolting, the “divergence” from com-munism “is deepening”.
Where the divergence lies, it is impossible to tell.
Not a shadow of an indication of a divergence in politics or in ideas.
There is a divergence of mood—between people who are engaged in politics or are absorbed in a struggle of the most furious kind, and the mood of a man who has artificially driven himself into a situation where he can’t observe the new life, while his impressions of the decay of a vast bourgeois capital are getting the better of him.
I have expressed my thoughts to you frankly on the sub-ject of your letter.
From my conversations (with you) I have long been approaching the same ideas, but your letter gave shape and conclusion, it rounded off the sumtotal of the impressions I have gained from these conversa-tions.
I don’t want to thrust my advice on you, but I cannot help saying: change your circumstances radically, your en-vironment, your abode, your occupation—otherwise life may disgust you for good.
All the best.

SKLYANSKY Comrade Sklyansky, I am not well, I have had to go to bed.
Therefore reply by messenger.
The delaying of the offensive in the Voronezh direction (from August 1 to 10!!!) is monstrous.
The successes of Denikin are enormous.
What’s wrong? Sokolnikov said that there (on the approaches to Voronezh) our forces were four to one.
So what is wrong? How could we miss the boat in this way? Tell the Commander-in-Chief that this won’t do.
Serious attention is required.
Should I not send the following telegram to the Revo-lutionary Military Council of the Southern Front (copy to Smilga): In code To be late with the offensive is quite intolerable, because this delay will yield the whole Ukraine to Denikin and will ruin us.
You answer for every day and even hour that the offensive is held up unnecessarily.
Inform us at once of your explanations, and the date when at last you will begin a resolute offensive.

SKLYANSKY Secret.
Take copies, and send one to Comrade Sklyan-sky with this note: Comrade Sklyansky, It is clear from this that they are trying to shift respon-sibility.
Probably there isn’t a single battle-worthy unit against Mamontov: this is an absolute disgrace, and com-plete negligence on the part of the Revolutionary Military Council, or complete failure to use an opportunity.
As energetic measures as possible must be taken! Lenin To Sklyansky.
See to it yourself that all this is kept secret.
Addition: The railway people say that our units that have been sent against Mamontov are afraid to leave their trucks.
By sending such units, the Revolutionary Military Coun-cil of the Republic disgraces itself.
Written at the end of August 1 9 1 9 First published in 1 9 4 2 in Lenin Miscellany XXXIV Printed from the original223 TELEGRAM TO THE BASHKIR REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE Bashkir Revolutionary Committee Ufa Copy to Comrade Validov Now that the decisive victories of the Red Army in the East have assured the free development of the Bashkir people, the decision of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic to transfer some Bashkir units to Petrograd acquires exceptional political importance.
The predatory imperialists will see that the awakened peoples of the East have risen to defend the centres of the proletarian revo-lution.
At the same time close contact between the armed Bashkirs and the workers of Petrograd will ensure close ties and mutual respect in the spirit of communism.
I express my profound conviction that the Revolutionary Committee of the Bashkir Republic, and all advanced Bashkir comrades, will make every effort to ensure that the transfer of the Bashkir units takes place in the shortest possible time and with the least possible burdening of the railways.
Please transmit fraternal greetings to the Bashkir Red Army men.

GUSEV 356 Comrade Gusev, Thinking over the letter from Sklyansky (about the situa-tion on September 15) and the sum total of the operations reports, I am becoming convinced that our Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic is working badly.
To keep on with reassuring reports is bad tactics.
It becomes “ a game of reassurance ” .
But in reality, we have stagnation, almost collapse.
At the Siberian Front they have put some blackguard Olderogge and the old woman Pozern in charge, and “reas-sured themselves”.
An absolute disgrace! And now we are beginning to get beaten! We shall make the R.

responsible for this, if energetic steps are not taken! To let victory slip out of our hands is a disgrace.
Inaction against Mamontov.
Evidently, there has been one delay after another.
The troops marching on Voronezh from the North were late.
We were late in transferring the 21st Division to the South.
We were late with the armoured cars.
Late with communications.
Whether it was the Com-mander-in-Chief alone who visited Orel, or whether he went with you, is all one: the job was not done.
Communications with Selivachov were not established, supervision of him was not established, in spite of the long-standing and direct demand of the Central Committee.
As a result, inaction against Mamontov and inaction with Selivachov (instead of the “victories” promised from day to day in childish little drawings—do you remember how you showed me these little drawings, and how I said: they’ve forgotten the enemy?!).
If Selivachov deserts, or his divisional commanders betray us, the guilty party will be the R.

MEZHLAUK October 20, 1919 Comrades Kaminsky, Oskin and Mezhlauk Tula Comrades, Tula is just now of exceptional importance—and generally speaking, even independently of the enemy being close at hand, Tula is of vast importance to the Republic.
Therefore you must exert all your energy to achieve co-ordinated work, concentrating everything on military affairs and military supplies.
I regret very much the friction between yourselves and Zelikman on one side and Peters (he is an important and extremely dedicated person) on the other, and I think that this is Zelikman’s fault because, if some unevenness was noticeable, it should have been immediately put right (and this was not difficult to do), without letting matters reach a conflict.
The slightest unevenness must in future be settled, reporting to the centre in time, not allowing it to develop into a conflict.
Every effort must be made to improve the work in Tula; it must be placed entirely on a war footing.
A decree reduc-ing the civil administration will be published in a few days.
Not only must it be observed; it must be applied with supreme conscientiousness and zeal.
358 In Tula the masses are far from being on our side.
Hence the necessityfor particularly intensive work among the troops, among the reservists, among the working men and women.
If you are short of personnel, write: we shall send you help from Moscow.
Check up on the defence work unremittingly.
Are strong points being put up? Is the work weakening? Are there enough materials, and workers? Are the Red Army men being trained? Are supplies for them in order? All these and similar questions must be assigned for special super-vision to practical people and comrades devoted to the Party.
You bear full responsibility for the success of this work and for any negligence (if you do not complain in time and do not appeal to the centre).
The formation of army units is of exceptional importance.
If we take Orel, 359 the effort should not be reduced, but, multiplied tenfold, since without this we shall not conquer, and an interruption in the offensive means death for us.
Read this letter to all responsible workers and Party members and regularly, very briefly, keep me informed of what in fact is being done.

The pamphlet is a horrible piece of work.
A slovenly mess.
No table of contents.
Some idiot or sloven, evidently an illiterate, has lumped together, as though he were drunk, all the “material”, little articles, speeches, and printed them out of sequence.
No preface, no minutes, no exact text of the decisions, no separation of decisions from speeches, articles, notes, nothing at all! An unheard-of disgrace! A great historic event has been disgraced by such a pam-phlet.
I demand: (1) Correction by pasting in.
(The guilty persons to be sent to prison and obliged to paste in the additions in every copy.
) That I should be informed: (2a) How many copies were printed? (2b) How many have been sold?(3) Reprinting in a decent form.

(4) Establishment of a rule that one definite person should be responsible for each publication (a register of responsible persons to be started).

ZINOVIEV Comrade Zinoviev, (1) It is said that the combustible slate near Veimarn is not deep down.
If two or three sazhens of earth are removed, an excavator can be used to break up the slate and extract it.
We must make an effort; mobilise the bourgeoisie for this (they can live in dug-outs for the time being); work three shifts of eight hours; rouse the Petrograd workers for this job; mobilise the peasants (four hours a day for two weeks, as a beginning and so on).
(2) It is said that Zhuk (the one who was killed) was making sugar out of sawdust? Is that true? If it is true, you absolutely must find his assistants, in order to continue the job.
The importance is tremendous.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY Gleb Maximilianych, I was very interested in your report on peat.
Wouldn’t you write an article about it in Ekonomiches-kaya Zhizn (and then republish as a pamphlet, or in some journal)? 361 The question must be discussed in the press.
Here, you should say, are reserves of peat—milliards.
Its heat efficiency.
Its location—near Moscow; Moscow Region.
Near Petrograd—as exactly as possible.
Easy to secure (in comparison with coal, combustible slate, etc.
).
Use of the labour of the local workers and peasants (even if only four hours a day for a start).
Here, you say, is the basis for electrification, increasing output so many times by using existing power stations.
Here is the most rapid and most certain basis for the resto-ration of industry— —organisation of labour in socialist fashion (agricul-ture& industry); —a way out of the fuel crisis (we shall release so many millions of cubic metres of timber for transport).
Put in the conclusions of your report; add a peat map; brief and general calculations.
The possibility of building peat machines quickly, etc.
, etc.
Briefly, the essence of the economic programme.
The question must be brought up immediately in the press.

364 It’s a magnificent thing, but then it’s a dictionary of regional terms, and out of date.
Is it not time to produce a dictionary of the real Russian language, a dictionary, say, of words used nowadays and by the classics, from Pushkin to Gorky? What if 30 scholars were set to work at this, and provided with Red Army rations? What would be your attitude to this idea? A dictionary of the classical Russian language? Without making a noise about it, have a talk with people who know the subject, if it’s not too much trouble, and let me know your opinion.

365 Magnificent.
We need several such articles.
Then we shall publish them as a pamphlet.
3 6 6 What we lack is specialists with a wide horizon and “an eye for the future”.
It is necessary (1) for the time being to cut out the foot-notes or reduce them.
There are too many of them for a newspaper (I will have a talk with the editor tomorrow).
(2) Would it not be possible to add a plan, not a technical one (this, of course, is a job for many people, and not to be done in a hurry), but a political or state plan, i.
e.
, a task for the proletariat? Approximately as follows: in 10 (5?) years let us build 0-30 (30-50?) power stations, in order to cover the whole country with a network of centres of 400 (or 200, if we can’t manage more) versts radius; using peat, water, combusti-ble slate, coal, oil (for example, make a survey of the whole of Russia, giving rough approximations).
Let’s begin at once buying the necessary machines and models, you say.
In 10 (20?) years we’ll make Russia “electrical”.
I think you could produce such a “plan”—I repeat, not a technical one but a state one—a draft plan.
It must be provided right away, in a visual, popular form, for the masses, so as to carry them forward with a clear and vivid perspective (entirely scientific at its founda-tions): let’s set to work, and in 10-20 years we shall make all Russia, both industrial and agricultural, electrical.
Weshall set ourselves the target of having so many (thousands or millions of horse-power or kilowatts?? devil knows what) mechanical slaves and so on.
Could there also be a tentative map of Russia with centres and their areas? Or is that not yet possible? I repeat, we must carry away the mass of workers and politically-conscious peasants with a great programme for the next 10-20 years.
Let’s have a talk on the telephone.

Krasin says that electrification of the railways is impossible for us.
I that true? And if it is, perhaps it will be possible in 5-10 years? Maybe it is possible in the Urals?

Ring me up on the telephone, please, when you get this letter, and we shall have a talk.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY March 14 Gleb Maximilianovich, After looking through the statement by the GOELRO 369 and thinking over yesterday’s talk, I have come to the conclusion that it is dry.
It is not enough.
Can’t you write, or commission an article from Krug (or someone else) of such a kind as to prove or, at any rate, illustrate a) the tremendous advantage, b) the necessity of electrification.
For example: I.
Transport.
To restore in the old way— we need α millions (at pre-war price) or α fuel & β working days.
But to restore it on the basis of electrification α minus x million rubles α minus y fuel & (β minus z) working days.
α Or also , but with an effect so many times greater α&β than the previous one.
II.
Steam power.
If industry is restored in the old way, we must spend more than for restoring it on the basis of electrification.
III.
Agriculture.
To restore, say, & 5 million ploughs and teams of horses.
The cost of doing this in the old way, and with electrifi-cation? This is a rough idea.
I think an intelligent specialist will do this work in a couple of days (if he wants to do it conscientiously), taking either the figures of pre-war sta-tistics (a few, really a few, summary figures), or a rough and approximate calculation (“as a first approximation ” 370 towards a first approximation).
Commission this.
Perhaps you will commission somebody to collect the material for you and write the article yourself or give an interview.
I will send an interviewer.
Then we shall have the warp for propaganda.
And that is important.
After reading this, ring me up on the telephone.

POKROVSKY 376 May 5, 1920 Comrade Pokrovsky, Some time ago it happened that I talked with Comrade Lunacharsky about the necessity of publishing a good dictionary of the Russian language.
* Not like Dahl, but a dictionary for use (and study) by all, a dictionary, so to speak, of the classical, contemporary Russian language (for example, from Pushkin to Gorky, perhaps).
Provide about 30 scholars, or as many as are needed, with rations, taking, of course, those who are not suitable for any other work—and let them do the job.
Lunacharsky said that he had been thinking about this already, and that it was either being done or would be done.
Be so kind as to find out whether it is being done, and drop me a line.

I very much regret that I have not been able to fulfil my desire to see you more often and to become better acquainted.
But your books, and what my sister has often told me, have aroused a profound affection for you in me, and I very much want to say to you how necessary your work is for the workers and for all of us, and how essential it is now for you to be firm, in order to overcome your grief and force yourself to return to work.

KURSKY 378 Have measures been taken for the immediate (1) setting up of Soviet power in the liberated areas; (2) holding of congresses of Soviets; (3) expulsion of the landowners, distribution of part of their lands among the poor peasants and the remainder among Soviets of agricultural labourers? Written early in July 1 9 2 0 First published in 1 9 4 5 in Lenin Miscellany XXXV Printed from the original248 TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL Theses should also be written for the Second Congress of the Third International on the international economic and political situation.
Could not Radek, or Lapinsky, who has more time, or someone else, whom they would advise, be given the job of making a preliminary draft of these theses, approximately on the following lines 379: (1) The division of the whole world (both in the sense of the spheres of influence of banking and finance capital, and in the sense of international syndicates and cartels, and equally in the sense of the seizure of colonies and semi-colonies) is the basic fact of imperialism, of the econ-omy of the twentieth century.
(2) Hence imperialist wars are inevitable in general, and particularly the first imperialist war of 1914-18.
(3) Results of this war: (a) reduction in the number of states that are world powers, increase in the number of weak, depend-ent states which are being plundered and divided; (b) the tremendous sharpening of all capitalist contradictions, both within all the capitalist coun-tries and among the countries themselves; (c) in particular, the sharpening, on a world scale, of both poles of capitalism: increase of luxury among a tiny number of capital-ist magnates; increase of need, poverty, ruin, famine, unemploy-ment, extreme insecurity of existence;(d) intensification of militarism, more intense and accelerated preparation for new imperialist wars, economically inevitable; a growth in the number of wars throughout the world, particularly of revo-lutionary wars; (e) complete bankruptcy of the League of Nations, exposure of its falseness; the collapse of “Wilsonism”.
The bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy.
(4) Explanation, in the briefest way, by characteris-ing (cf.
the report by P.
Levi, April 14, 1920 380): Britain and America France Japan the other, neutral countries of Europe and America the defeated countries (principally Russia and Ger-many) the colonies the semi-colonies (Persia, Turkey, China).
(5) Raw material—its exhaustion industry—its weakening (fuel, etc.
) currencies—their collapse.
Debts.
Devaluation.
“Dislocation”, break-up of the whole system of world economy.
(6) The result = a world revolutionary crisis.
The com-munist movement and Soviet power.

2) Gukovsky to be answered.
3) Curzon to be replied to in two days (not earlier; why spoil them), after asking Kamenev and the Consul once again: why haven’t we received the original in English? The reply to be extra polite on the following lines if Britain (& France & ? & ?) wants a general, i.
e.
, a real peace, we have long been for it.
In that case remove Wrangel, since he is your man, kept by you, and then we begin negotiations at once.
If Poland wants peace, we are for; we’ve said it clearly and we repeat it, let her make an offer.
If you interrupt trade negotiations, we are very sorry, but you expose yourselves as departing from the truth, because you began these negotiations during Poland’s war and promised an armistice.
Calmly and precisely expose their contradictions.
The draft reply to be approved by telephone through the members of the Political Bureau on Friday or Saturday, July 23 or 24.

My talk with Comrade Ilyin about the energetic work being done in the Siberian mines and his report of the gradual growth of conscious discipline among the workers (who are now working not for the capitalists but for themselves) gave me tremendous pleasure.
Particularly precious in your greetings, comrades, was the feeling of the deepest conviction in the final and com-plete victory of Soviet power over the landowners, capital-ists and all kinds of exploiters, and also your unswerving firmness and determination to overcome all obstacles and difficulties.
It is from this firmness of the working class and toiling masses that, like every other Communist, I draw my confidence in the inevitable world victory of the workers and the workers’ cause.

385 Then they will be informed, and will be in a position to give me their version: and then I will not be informed one-sidedly.
On the substance of the matter, this briefly is my view.
Until we have completely beaten Wrangel, until we have captured the entire Crimea, military tasks come first.
That is absolutely unquestionable.
Furthermore, for Tula, in view of its armaments and ammunition works, it may very well be that for a certain time even after victory over Wrangel it will still be a task of first priority to go through with producing rifles and am-munition, because the Army must be made ready by the spring.
Excuse my brevity, and please inform me whether you have shown the “opposition” this letter of mine and your letter to me.

KLASSON 387 November 2, 1920 Comrade Klasson, I fear that you—excuse my frankness—will not be up to making use of the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars on Hydropeat.
388 I fear this because you, evidently, have spent too much time on “senseless dreams” about the restoration of capitalism, and have not been sufficiently attentive to the extremely specific features of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism.
But I say this not in order to reproach you, and not only because I remembered the theoretical arguments I had with you in 1894-95, but with a narrowly practical object.
In order to make proper use of the decision of the C.
P.
C.
you must 1) complain with ruthless strictness and in good time of any breaches of this decision, checking up very closely on its fulfilment and, of course, selecting for complaint only those cases which come under the rule, “few but to the point”; 2) from time to time—again following the same rule— write to me (N.

M.
, This is a very important thing.
Our Commission 389 (to which surely you have been invited? by the previous decision?) will meet tomorrow (or November 8 in the morn-ing).
The (attached) draft of the subcommission must be attentively discussed beforehand.
GOELRO * has not been included at all! In my opinion this is not right: what is any “plan” worth (or any “planning commission” or “planning pro-gramme”) without a plan of electrification? It is worth nothing.
Strictly speaking, it is GOELRO which should be the single planning organ of the Council of People’s Commissars; but so simply and brutally this will not be accepted, and it would be wrong.
We must think over (urgently, before tomorrow) how the question should be put.
Perhaps (1) the chairman of GOELRO should be given a consultative vote in the economic department of the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars 390 ? (2) GOELRO should be made a standing commission of the C.

* See Note 369.

(3) All planning commissions of all People’s Commissar-iats should he linked and co-ordinated with GOELRO.
But how? By setting up yet one more commission attached to GOELRO, composed of the chairmen of all the separate planning commissions? Or how otherwise? Ring me up when you have read this.
And return me the minutes (of the subcommission of November 5) today, not later than 10 p.

, The following idea has come into my head.
There must he propaganda for electricity.
How? Not only in words but by example.
What does this mean? The most important thing is to make it popular.
For this we have, here and now, to work out a plan for lighting up every house in the R.

by electricity.
This is a long-term affair, because neither 20,000,000 (-40,000,000?) bulbs, nor wire, etc.
, shall we have for a long time.
But all the same a plan is needed now, if only to cover a number of years.
That comes first.
And secondly, we must work out right away a shorter plan, and then thirdly—and this is most important—we must be able to arouse both competition and initiative among the masses, so that they set about the job straightaway.
Would it not be possible for this purpose immediately to work out such a plan (for example): (1) All volosts (10-15 thousand) to be supplied with electric lighting in one year.
(2) All settlements ( 2 -1 million, probably not more than w million) in two years.
(3) Priority for the reading-room and the Soviet (two light bulbs).
(4) Get the poles ready at once in such-and-such a way.
(5) Prepare the insulators at once yourselves (ceramicsworks, I believe, are local and small affairs?).
Make them in such-and-such a way.
(6) Copper for the wires? Collect it yourselves in your uyezd and volosts (a gentle hint at church bells, etc.
).
(7) Organise training in electricity in such-and-such a way.
Could not something of this kind be considered, worked out and decreed? Yours, Lenin Written in December 1 9 2 0 First published in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn No.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY Comrade Krzhizhanovsky Would it not be possible to develop (not at once, but straightaway after the Congress,392 for the Council of Labour and Defence) a practical plan for an electrification campaign: Etwas*: (1) in each uyezd urgently to set up at least one power station; (2) make it obligatory for this centre to become a train-ing, lecture, demonstration, etc.
, centre, and take the entire population through these courses (beginning with the young people, or by volosts, etc.
); (3) immediately assign tasks among the population as to what they can now make a start on (we need 2 2 million poods of copper—so let us at once assign tasks for bring-ing in 5 million poods, let people voluntarily begin to collect church bells, door handles, etc.
; then poles, etc.
); (4) begin preparatory navvying work at once, assigning tasks among the uyezds; (5) mobilise all engineers, electricians, all who have done courses at physico-mathematical faculties, etc.
, without exception.
Their obligation will be to deliver not less than two (four?) lectures a week, to teach not less than (10-50?) people about electricity.
If they fulfil this-a bonus.
If they don’t—gaol.
(6) Write urgently a few popular pamphlets (some to * Something like this.

And then a number of detailed measures on the follow-ing two groups: aa) propaganda and training bb) first steps towards putting this into practice at once, and from all angles.

You ask me to take steps from here in Moscow to put an end to these counter-revolutionary actions.
But to fight on the spot, with all your strength against counter-revolu-tion is one of the most important tasks of local Party organ-isations, including yours.
Your bounden duty is, by getting into touch with the Uyezd Party Committee, and—if that does not help—with the Gubernia Party Committee, to secure the arrest and prosecution before the Revolutionary Tribunal of counter-revolutionaries and scoundrels like those about whom you are reporting.
What have you done in this direction? In the second part of his letter, Comrade Turunen sets out your view that Soviet power, in order to overcome economic break-down, must for some time lean on thepeasantry as it would on a crutch.
This is quite true.
This has been said in our Party Programme, and in the resolu-tions of Party Congresses.
At the last, Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, the question of reviving agriculture was considered in detail and very carefully, and the Con-gress adopted important practical decisions, which you will have to apply on the spot, as directed by the Gubernia authorities.
These decisions have been published in the newspapers.
In addition, Comrade Turunen will bring you some supple-mentary material which he will have received at the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture, where he was sent on my recommendation.

Our military command has failed disgracefully by allow-ing Makhno to get away (in spite of an immense superior-ity of forces and strict orders to catch him), and is now failing still more disgracefully by proving unable to crush a handful of bandits.
Order a brief report for me from the Commander-in-Chief (with a brief sketch showing the disposition of bands and troops) about what is being done.
How is the wholly reliable cavalry being used? — the armoured trains? (Are they rationally distribut-ed? Are they not moving wastefully, requisitioning grain?) — armoured cars? — aeroplanes? How, and how many are in use? Both grain and wood fuel, everything is being lost because of the bands, while we have a million-strong army.
You must do all you can to brace up the Commander-in-Chief.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY February 25 Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, On the question of the General Planning Commission.
395 (1) On its composition in general we shall come to an agreement after your arrival.
This will not be difficult.
(2) The Central Committee has decided to leave in Larin for the time being.
The danger from him is a very great one, because it is in his character to disorganise any work, seize power, overthrow all chairmen, drive specialists away, speak (without a shadow of right to do so) in the name “of the Party”, etc.
On you falls the heavy task of subordinating, disciplin-ing, moderating Larin.
Remember: directly he “begins” to go beyond limits, rush to me (or send me a letter).
Otherwise Larin will upset the whole General Planning Commission.
(3) You have to set up within the General Planning Commission a super-firm presidium (it must be without Larin), so that organisers and strong people (capable of giving a complete rebuff to Larin, and steadily going ahead with this difficult work) should help you and relieve you of administrative work (it was pointed out at the Central Committee that you are, strictly speaking, not an adminis-trator).
The Presidium, perhaps, could consist of two of your assistants, one secretary, and so forth.
You must be the “leading spirit” of the work and the ideological guide (in particular, kick out, get rid of tactless Communistswho may drive out the specialists).
.
.
.
Your task is to catch, select, put on the job capable organisers, administrators (like Osadchy, etc.
)—to provide the Central Committee of N.

the R.

P.
with the opportunity, the data, the material, for |||| evaluating them.
(4) The “GOELRO” as a GOELRO, you must restore as a subcommission of the General Planning Commission.
You will be chairman of this subcommission too.
(5) You will have to set up quite a number of subcom-missions: we must have a talk about this, when you have a plan for them.
(6) What will be exceptionally important is the sub-commission on study, checking and “tying up”, co-ordination, making proposals for altering current economic plans (for 1921 at the present moment).
Larin must without fail be made a member of this sub-commission but (1) not as chairman and not as vice-chair-man and not as secretary; (2) counterbalancing him, say, with Sereda, as a model of balanced mind, non-fantasy, non-harrassment.
(7) I suggest that you think over the following plan (I consider it most important): to oblige a few persons, mem-bers of the General Planning Commission, systematically to present either to the Commission or to the subcommission under § 6 reports and articles on the fulfilment by various departments (and by various gubernias, uyezds, groups of factories, individual factories, etc.
) of current economic plans and on the comparison of this fulfilment with various years and for printing in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn.
(I con-sider it most important that Larin without fail, and also Sereda, Popov, Strumilin, should be formally obliged to follow with the greatest attention the facts and figures of the real fulfilment of our economic plans, and should print regular notes in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn for public criticism and checking.
Two or three specialists could also be set to work on this.
It is essential that each should answer individually for the study and the checking; and that on each part of this work there should be two persons, inde-pendent of one another, for mutual checking and for testing various methods of analysis, summarising, etc.
).
Think about all this and let’s have a talk more than once after your arrival.

Issue the appropriate directive at once to all army institutions, including the Special Department.
Hold to account all who infringe this directive.
Inform us of every case of such infringement, or of even the least friction and misunderstanding with the local population.

396 Its main defect: too much about electrification, too little about current economic plans.
The main emphasis is not laid where it should be.
When I had before me the communist “wiseheads” who had not read the book The Electrification Plan 3 9 7 and had not understood its importance and were chattering and writing nonsense about the plan in general, I had to push their noses into this book, because there is no other serious plan and there cannot be.
* If I had before me the people who wrote that book, I should push their noses not into the book but away from it—into the problems of current economic plans.
Get down to those problems now, Messrs.
Professors! Your electrification is in allen Ehren.
** Honour to it indeed.
You’ve written the first edition.
We’ll make improvements and publish a second.
The specialists in such-and-such a subcommission will write a dozen decrees and resolutions on teaching electricity and the electrifica-tion plan, and so forth.
We shall endorse them.
But the general state planning commission should now busy itself not with this, but immediately, with all its strength, set about the current economic plans.

When will the main plan of work be drawn up? What questions will be included in this plan? Such questions as the writing of textbooks—the library network and its use—model schools—accountability of the teachers— programmes for training courses, lectures, classes in schools—supervision over the degree of effective fulfilment of programmes and the progress of class studies? Or other questions? Which? What questions have been recognised as most important and urgent? Are there decisions on this subject? What measures are being taken for systematic supervision of their fulfilment? I request a brief reply.

We have taken a number of steps, given a little gold to Armenia, confirmed all kinds of instructions to the Commissariat of Food.
But I must warn you that we are in great need here, and will not be able to help.
I urgently require that you should set up a regional economic body for the whole of Transcaucasia, make the utmost effort with concessions, especially in Georgia; try and buy seed, even if it be abroad, and push forward irrigation in Azerbaijan with the help of the resources of Baku, in order to expand agriculture and cattle-breeding, and also try and develop commodity exchange with the North Caucasus.
Have you and the Georgian comrades grasped the significance of our new policy in connection with the tax in kind 399 ? Read this to them and keep me more frequently informed; read my letter to Serebrovsky in Baku.

Specifically it is necessary (1) to instruct the State Pub-lishing House to print by April 15, 100,000 copies of Peat, a pamphlet of 1 2 signatures, delivered by the Central Peat Board on February 8 this year to Comrade Mordvinkin at the Agitation Department, and to accept from the Central Peat Board another three pamphlets and leaflets, for publication by May 1; 15,000 copies of the pamphlets to be issued to the Central Peat Board for distribution.
(2) To instruct the Film Department to make 12 films in the course of May—under the direction of the Central Peat Board—showing how peat is secured (for Russia, the Ukraine, the Urals, Byelorussia and Siberia).
(3) To instruct the Central Board for Vocational Train-ing to draw up by June 1, together with the Central Peat Board, a draft course of compulsory lessons in schools and higher educational establishments on the peat industry.
Please send me copies of your instructions, and the replies of the institutions and persons concerned, with an indica-tion of the dates.

, Yesterday I talked with Smilga.
He should be having a talk with you today.
The question of the main features of the state plan, not as an institution but as a plan, cannot be put off.
You now know the tax in kind and other decrees.
There is the policy for you.
And you make as careful a calculation as possible (taking into account harvests of various sizes) how much this can produce.
Immeasurably still more urgent is fuel.
Timber-float-ing has broken down.
The bad harvest resulting from such a spring will thwart deliveries.
Let Ramzin and Co within two days provide me with brief summaries: three figures (wood fuel, coal, oil) 1918??? by half-years 1919 1920 particularly 191 and the plan for 1922 the fuel plan for 1920 four figures: laid down? secured? how was the quantity laid down to be distrib-uted (only the main headings)? how was the quantity secured distributed?By Thursday morning.
On this will depend my decision regarding foreign trade.
Order it today.
We shall have a talk tomorrow.

, Is the instruction clear? We must presume that we shall have in 1921-22 the same, or even worse, harvest failure fuel shortage (on account of lack of food and fodder for the horses).
From this point of view there should be calculated what purchases are needed abroad in order at all costs to over-come our most dire shortages, i.
e.
, to procure without fail the foodstuffs that are lacking (by direct purchase of provi-sions abroad, and by exchange of goods for grain in the out-lying regions of Russia) and to secure the necessary addition-al minimum of fuel.
Only those requirements can and must be justified which are essential from this point of view.
Not all electrical requirements come under this heading.
It is not enough to demonstrate that electricity economises fuel.
It must be demonstrated in addition that this expenditure is essential for 191-, given maximum shortage of grain and fuel.

SOKOLOV May 16 Comrade M.
Sokolov, Secretary of the Department for Management of Property Evacuated from Poland Dear Comrade, I have received and read your draft report for May 18.
401 You write that I have “slipped up”.
On the one hand, you say, by leasing forests, land, etc.
, we are introducing state capitalism, and on the other hand, he (Lenin) “talks” about “expropriating the landowners”.
This seems to you a contradiction.
You are mistaken.
Expropriation means deprivation of property.
A lessee is not a property-owner.
That means there is no contradiction.
The introduction of capitalism (in moderation and skil-fully, as I say more than once in my pamphlet * ) is possible without restoring the landowners’ property.
A lease is a contract for a period.
Both ownership and control remain with us, the workers’ state.
“What fool of a lessee will spend money on model organ-isation,” you write, “if he is pursued by the thought of possible expropriation.
.
.
.
” Expropriation is a fact, not a possibility.
That makes a big difference.
Before actual expropriation not a single capitalist would have entered our service as a lessee.
Where-as now “they”, the capitalists, have fought three years, * See “The Tax in Kind” (present edition, Vol.
32, pp.
329-65).
— Ed.
and wasted hundreds of millions of rubles in gold of their own (and those of the Anglo-French, the biggest money-bags in the world) on war with us.
Now they are having a bad time abroad.
What choice have they? Why should they not accept an agreement? For 10 years you get not a had income, otherwise .
.
.
you die of hunger abroad.
Many will hesitate.
Even if only five out of 100 try the experi-ment, it won’t be too bad.
You write: “Independent mass activity is possible only when we wipe off the face of the earth that ulcer which is called the bureaucratic chief administrations and central boards.
” Although I have not been out in the provinces, I know this bureaucracy and all the harm it does.
Your mistake is to think that it can be destroyed all at once, like an ulcer, that it can be “wiped off the face of the earth”.
This is a mistake.
You can throw out the tsar, throw out the landowners, throw out the capitalists.
We have done this.
But you cannot “throw out” bureaucracy in a peasant country, you cannot “wipe it off the face of the earth”.
You can only reduce it by slow and stubborn effort.
To “throw off” the “bureaucratic ulcer”, as you put it in another place, is wrong in its very formulation.
It means you don’t understand the question.
To “throw off” an ulcer of this kind is impossible.
It can only be healed.
Surgery in this case is an absurdity, an impossibility; only a slow cure—all the rest is charlatanry or naïveté.
You are naïve, that’s just what it is, excuse my frank-ness.
But you yourself write about your youth.
It’s naïve to wave aside a healing process by referring to the fact that you have 2-3 times tried to fight the bureau-crats and suffered defeat.
First of all, I reply to this, your unsuccessful experiment, you have to try, not 2-3 times, but 20-30 times—repeat your attempts, start over again.
Secondly, where is the evidence that you fought cor-rectly, skilfully? Bureaucrats are smart fellows, many scoun-drels among them are extremely cunning.
You won’t catch them with your bare hands.
Did you fight correctly? Did you encircle the “enemy” according to all the rules of the art of war? I don’t know.
It’s no use your quoting Engels.
402 Was it not some“intellectual” who suggested that quotation to you? A futile quotation, if not something worse.
It smells of the doctrinaire.
It resembles despair.
But for us to despair is either ridiculous or disgraceful.
The struggle against bureaucracy in a peasant and abso-lutely exhausted country is a long job, and this struggle must be carried on persistently, without losing heart at the first reverse.
“Throw off” the “chief administrations”? Nonsense.
What will you set up instead? You don’t know.
You must not throw them off, but cleanse them, heal them, heal and cleanse them ten times and a hundred times.
And not lose heart.
If you give your lecture (I have absolutely no objection to this), read out my letter to you as well, please.
I shake your hand, and beg you not to tolerate the “spirit of dejection” in yourself.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY May 25 Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, You should have been sent the draft “Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence”.
* Think it over yourself (and the Presidium too—and all members of the State Planning Commission should be informed) from two points of view: (a) it includes problems concerning your “department”: electrification and the local bodies of the State Planning Commission.
What is needed in this case is a detailed analysis and study by all of you, in order to verify and supplement (resp.
alter) the list of detailed problems; (b) the remainder does not come under the jurisdiction of the State Planning Commission, but much of it in essence affects the Commission.
The opinion of the latter is desirable (not obligatory).
Lenin P.

Do you not think that it will be necessary to appoint a group of members of the State Planning Commis-sion to study the uyezd reports, and all economic reports in general? Or should all members of the Commission be given several reports each, with the obligation to read and study them? By the way: the study of current economic plans (for 1921) must definitely be individualised.

the State Planning Commission answers for such-and-such a side or part of this work.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY May 26, 1921 Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, I think it is necessary for the State Planning Commission to work out two things: (1) through the statistical subcommission, to draw up a kind of index-number.
A monthly summary of the chief data of our economic life (figures and a curve).
Approximately: Output of fuel ore ” iron.
” The main data about other branches of industry: % of workers engaged in production; % of under-fulfilment of sowing plan; state of agricultural production; % of locomotives out of action; absolute number of pood-versts; timber, wood fuel, etc.
; supplies of foodstuffs, etc.
; electrification likewise (in each case a comparison with the previous year and with pre-war).
Without this we shall not have a survey of economic life.
This is one of the fundamentals for the work of the State Planning Commission.
(2) A subcommission of economic statistics.
The Central Statistical Board should be made into an organisation that does analysis for us, current, not “scien-tific” analysis.
For example: How many superfluous people fed? How many superfluous factories? How should raw materials be redistributed? And labour-power? The economic work of the army? Statisticians must be our practical assistants, not engage in scholastics.
Think over this, and drop me a line about the results.

PAVLOVICH 404 Comrade Pavlovich People’s Commissariat of Nationalities May 31, 1921 Comrade Pavlovich, I have arranged for publication of a school atlas (in Petrograd).
405 It would be extremely important to include maps of imperialism.
Would you not undertake this? For example: (1) colonial possessions 1876-1914-1921, adding or spe-cially shading off semi-colonial countries (Turkey, Persia, China, and so forth).
(2) Brief statistics of colonies and semi-colonies.
(3) Map of financial dependencies.
For example, for each country ± with a figure (millions or milliards of francs) of how much this country owes, and how much it is owed; also comparatively for 1876-1914-1921 (if 1876 be taken as the culminating point of pre-monop-oly capitalism).
(4) Railways of the world, with a note, in each country, showing to whom most of them belong (British, French, North America, etc.
).
Will this prove too much of a mixture? Convenient forms can be found, with what matters, what predominates noted very briefly.
(5) The main sources of those raw materials over which there is a struggle (oil, ores, etc.
)—also with notes (% or millions of francs belong to such-and-such a country).
We must without fail include maps of this kind in the textbooks, of course with a brief explanatory text.
A statistical assistant can be given you for the auxiliary work.
Please reply whether you undertake this, how and when.

(4) You should demand that they be strictly accountable, particularly as regards drawing non-Party people into the work and as regards reports to them, the non-Party people, on the work of the economic councils.
All this should be brought before the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and adopted, so that the local bodies conform to it.

There must be a brief (16-24 pp.

He asks for instructions.
In my opinion, you should draw up measures to intensify the work.
I propose (1) that you should press immediately, in particularly urgent, accelerated, revolutionary fashion for collection of the tax in Moscow Gubernia (the rye has already been harvested).
Moscow workers, in particular, should be mob-ilised for this, to assist the food supply organisations.
(2) In general, mobilise more workers for food supply, plundering the People’s Commissariats, in accordance with yesterday’s decision of the Political Bureau 409 (take a copy of it).
(3) Once more send precise orders to the Ukrainian and Siberian People’s Commissariats of Food.
(4) Delegate an emergency expedition (together with the Cen-tral Union of Consumers’ Co-operative Societies) to Podolsk Gubernia where, they say, there are masses of grain and it costs 6,000 rubles a pood in Soviet currency.
(In general, my impression is that, as regards purchases and barter, the People’s Commissariat of Food is asleep, and lagging behind disgracefully.
No initiative.
No bold work.

KOROSTELEV Comrade Korostelev, The work of your commission 410 is exceptionally impor-tant, responsible and difficult.
You must strain all your energies to see that you have fewer reverses; and not lose heart because of the reverses, but insistently and patiently resume the work, again and again.
In Moscow it is much more difficult to work than in the provinces—there is more bureaucracy, there are more corrupted and spoiled “top” people, etc.
But, in return, the work in Moscow will have tremendous demonstrative and political importance.
In my belief, your commission should try and adapt its work to the “Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence”.
The main thing is not to scatter your forces.
It is better to take a few establishments, not very big tasks, set yourselves, at first, modest aims—but pursue them stub-bornly, not forgetting what you have begun, not dropping the work half-way, but going on with it to the end.
Gradually, but without fail, draw in non-Party people from amongst workers well known for their honesty, and respected in every district.
Time and effort should not be spared in discovering them and getting to know them.
They should little by little, and carefully, be introduced to the work, and you must try to find an occupation entirely suited to each one, and appropriate to his capacities.
The main thing is to get the workers and the population used to the commission, in the sense that they should seehelp coming from it; the main thing is to win the confidence of the masses, the non-Party people, the rank-and-file work-ers, the ordinary men in the street.
For you of all people, as chairman of the commission and as a man from the centre, a member of the collegium of the unpopular Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, this will not be easy.
But this is the whole essence of the thing.
You must in every possible way, and in all possible respects, show that you are able to give, and actually give, help, real help, even if on a small scale.
Only on this basis can you go on further.
Please write to me or, if you don’t like writing, ring me up on the telephone—I can talk to you from my study, where it is quieter, so that we can exchange ideas on the work of your commission.
Show this letter to the other members of the commission, if you think it timely.
With communist greetings, Lenin July 26 P.

The main task of the commission is to improve our economy, improve management, secure real personal responsibility.
For this purpose a few more institutions should be selected: a canteen, baths, a laundry, a hostel, etc.

KHINCHUK July 29 Comrade Khinchuk, They say you are leaving? For how many months? Before your departure it is essential that you should both officially get your “deputy” appointed and, unofficially, should let me know to which of the Communists who are fully experi-enced people (2-3 of them) in the Central Union of Consu-mers’ Co-operative Societies I can address myself.
Then before your departure you must tell me, very briefly, when the machinery of the co-operative movement will begin working at last.
What I mean is this: (1) In how many volosts (of such-and-such gubernias) are there shops (co-operatives) and, consequently, your trading agents, and in how many are there none? How many per volost? (2) How many of the shops (agents) reply promptly to all the questions of the centre, and render reports? Once a week? Once a fortnight? (3) How many volost shops have received goods, and which (even the briefest replies)? Salt? Kerosene? Tex-tiles? etc.
(4) How many replies are there about the amount of surpluses and raw materials held by the peasants (which can be acquired in exchange for this or that)? grain? other foodstuffs? industrial raw materials? etc.
(5) How much have you exchanged during the period under review? Of what, for what? In my opinion, so long as there are no such reports, there is nothing.
Only talk.
I await your reply.

Please, in the first place, take over this wagon as rapidly as possible, without any red tape; secondly, dispatch it to the most needy Moscow workers, notifying them without fail that this is a present from the Stavropol workers and peasants; thirdly, see to it that the delegation is looked after, both in the sense of its being put up properly and of its receiving thanks from the Moscow Soviet, and, finally, that they are supplied with literature and given the opportunity of seeing the institutions in Moscow which interest them.
Please report fulfilment to me, immediately and pre-cisely.

ADORATSKY August 2 Comrade Adoratsky, I have looked through the introduction.
It’s difficult to judge, because it’s unfinished.
It looks as though it should be cut down, and expressed much more clearly, with closer attention to the formulations.
411 The really outstanding quotations from the letters should be combined with other works of Marx and with Capital (for example, on the question of “equality” what matters most is in Capital 412 ).
If you take question x, then on this question there is so-and-so in the letters, so-and-so in other works of Marx, so-and-so in Capital.
I could only glance at the letters.
Of course, you will still have to cut them down considerably, link them up, arrange them properly; think over each one two or three times, and then briefly comment.
Evidently there is more work involved than it seemed at first.
The chronological order (very likely you are right) is probably more convenient.

SAFAROV August 7 Comrade Safarov, Thank you very much for the pamphlet 414 and other material.
We are sending Joffe to make an attempt to combine your line and Tomsky’s.
That must be done.
Unquestionably grain and meat to Moscow, first and foremost.
For this purpose, both the “New Economic Policy” in general and a number of concessions and bonuses to the merchants.
At the same time, systematic and maximum concern for the Moslem poor, for their organisation and education.
Such a policy can and must be worked out and fixed (in a number of the most precise directives).
It must be a model for the whole East.
Best greetings.
Yours, Lenin P.

Gorbunov ! Comrade Dovgalevsky, Please let me have information about the state of wireless telephony in our country.
1) Is the Central Moscow Station working? If so, how many hours a day, and over what distance in versts? If not, what is lacking? 2) Are we manufacturing (and how many?) receivers, installations capable of voice reception from Moscow? 3) How do matters stand with loudspeakers, installa-tions which enable a whole hail (or square) to hear Moscow? Etc.
I am very much afraid that this business has once again “gone to sleep” (in the damnable manner of the Russian Oblomovs, 415 putting everyone and everything to sleep).
It has been “promised” many times, and all time limits have long ago expired! The importance of this affair for us (for propaganda in the East especially) is exceptional.
Delay and negligence here are criminal.
All this already exists abroad; what is lacking can andmust be bought.
In all probability, there is criminal negli-gence somewhere.

(1) (2) (3) (4) the addressee me Avanesov Gorbunov and Smolya-ninov I have sent you through the Office Manager of the Council of People’s Commissars a statement from Professor Graftio with astonishing documents about red tape.
416 This red tape is just what is to be expected, especially in the Moscow and central institutions.
But all the more attention should be given to fighting it.
My impression is that the People’s Commissariat of Justice is purely formal, i.
e.
, radically wrong, in its atti-tude to this question.
What is needed is: (1) to bring this matter before the courts; (2) to secure the disgrace of those guilty, both in the press and by strict punishment; (3) to stiffen up the judges through the Central Com-mittee, so that they punish red tape more severely; (4) to arrange a conference of the Moscow People’s Judges, members of tribunals, etc.
, to work out effective measures for fighting red tape;(5) without fail, this autumn and winter of 1921-22, to bring up for trial in Moscow 4-6 cases of Moscow red tape, selecting the more “vivid” cases, and making each trial a political affair; (6) to find some, if only 2-3, sensible “experts” on questions of red tape, among the more fierce and militant Communists (get hold of Sosnovsky), so as to train people to hound out red tape; (7) to publish a good, intelligent, non-bureaucratic letter (a circular of the People’s Commissariat of Justice) on the struggle against red tape.
I impose this most important task on the People’s Com-missar and his deputy, on their personal responsibility, and request that I be given regular information as to its fulfilment.

YEZHOV September 27, 1921 Comrade Yezhov, Head of Central Stores Board, Supreme Economic Council Comrade Yezhov, I have received and looked through the papers about the store.
Transfer to the Supreme Economic Council has now been decided.
417 I will expect you to let me have brief but precise reports on whether in practice any improvement in the stores busi-ness is being achieved, how the struggle against pilfering is going, as regards this store and other stores.
I am obliged to charge you, too, with red tape: “We’ve been shouting for three years”, “I took the matter through to the end nearly ten times, it seemed”, you write.
But the whole trouble is that not once did you take the matter through to the end, without any “it seemed”.
You know the Constitution of the R.

and the Rules of the R.
C.
P.
“To the end” means up to the session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee (if there is no Congress of Soviets).
In the Party line, it means the plenary meeting of the Central Committee.
You have not once taken the matter through to the end.
(1) A brief, “telegraphic”, but clear and precise state-ment to members of the C.
C.
and members of the Presid-ium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee; (2) an article in the press;(3) an initiative by the local or neighbouring unit of the R.
C.
P.
, its opinion, its question asked at the Moscow Soviet —these are three measures which are obligatory in the struggle against red tape.
This is a difficult struggle, that goes without saying.
But the difficult is not the impossible.
You gave up in despair, you did not fight, you did not exhaust all the means of fighting.
The stores business requires much more insistence in the struggle against red tape-checking “from below” and “by those below”—publicity in the press—checking again and again—etc.
I should like to hope that, having now had a painful and melancholy but useful experience, you will set about this battle with red tape in such a way as to really take the matter through “to the end”.
From time to time one must know the results of this struggle.
With communist greetings, Lenin P.
S.
Will you not send on some occasion, together with brief, quite brief information about the course of the struggle (with red tape), brief data about your staff (the number of people, how many of them are Communists, their quali-fications; responsible, purely executive, office workers, etc.
) and a brief plan of your work? Write briefly, in cablese, separating out special points, if necessary.
I won’t read a long document at all, that’s certain.
If there are practical proposals, put them down on a separate sheet, extremely brief, like a telegram, with a copy to my secretary.

GORBUNOV October 13, 1921 Comrade Gorbunov, Please get a decision, after the necessary agreement with the Chairman of the Narrow Council of People’s Commis-sars (and clearing the matter with the secretaries), that the system for summoning rapporteurs (both to the Full and the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars) should be altered.
At present those who have to report get a general summons to the meeting and wait for hours.
This is outrageous and barbarous.
You must see to it that they are told to come at one partic-ular time.
Provided there is a double check by telephone, whether rapporteurs are needed, and which; provided there is a correct distribution of the agenda of the given meeting (business requiring rapporteurs, business not requiring them), we can and must see to it that rapporteurs do not wait more than 15 minutes.
Please, work out such a system without delay, consider-ing it carefully, and let me have a decision on the subject, adopted by the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars.

1 7 , February 2 1 , 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original301 TO SIDNEY HILLMAN October 13, 1921 Comrade Hillman, I thank you with all my heart for your help.
Thanks to you an agreement was rapidly achieved on organisation of help for Soviet Russia by the American workers.
Partic-ularly important is the fact that the organisation of this aid has now been arranged in respect also of those workers who are not Communists.
Throughout the world, and partic-ularly in the most advanced capitalist countries, mil-lions of workers do not at the present time share the views of the Communists, but nonetheless are ready to help Soviet Russia, to help and feed the starving, if only some of them, and to help the cause of restoring the economy of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic.
Such workers repeat with complete conviction the words—and what is more important not only repeat the words but give them practical expression in life—of the leaders of the Amsterdam Trade Union International (unquestionably hostile to communism), namely, that any victory of the inter-national bourgeoisie over Soviet Russia would mean the greatest possible victory of world reaction over the work-ing class in general.
Soviet Russia is exerting all her strength to overcome starvation, ruin and dislocation.
The financial aid of the workers of the whole world is infinitely important for us in this respect, side by side with moral help and political help.
America, naturally, is at the head of the states wherethe workers can help us, are already helping us and will help—I am profoundly convinced—on a far greater scale.
Devoted to the cause, the energetic advanced workers of America will be taking the lead of all the workers of a number of industrial countries who are bringing Soviet Russia their technical knowledge, and their determination to make sacrifices in order to help the Workers’ and Peas-ants’ Republic to restore its economy.
Among the peaceful means of struggle against the yoke of international finance capital, against international reaction, there is no other means with such rapid and certain promise of victory as aid in the restoration of the economy of Soviet Russia.
With best greetings to all workers who are bringing aid, in one form or another, to Soviet Russia.

SEMASHKO October 24, 1921 Comrade Semashko, After signing today the decision of the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars on the 2,000 millions (I think that is the figure? 418 I don’t remember it exactly) for cleaning up Moscow, and after reading the “Regulations” of the People’s Commissariat of Health for the week of housing sanitation (Izvestia of July 1), I have come to the conclu-sion that my suspicions (about the complete inadequacy of the organisation of the whole business) are increasing.
The thousand millions will be taken, stolen and pilfered but the job won’t be done.
We must secure model (or at least, as a beginning, toler-able) cleanliness in Moscow, for one cannot even imagine a greater scandal than “Soviet” dirt in the “first” Soviet houses.
What then is to he expected in houses which are not first? Please send me the most brief but precise, business-like, factual report on what has been achieved by the week of sanitation, and where? Is there any gubernia where some-thing has been done without muddle? Further.
What is being done (and what has been done?) in Moscow? Who answers for this work? Is it only “officials” with a pompous Soviet title, who don’t understand a thing, who don’t know the business and only sign papers? Or are there business-like people in charge? Who in particular?V.

How many? Where and how have they given examples of their work? What other methods for real checking are there? Is money being spent on buying valuable articles (car-bolic? cleaning equipment? how much has been bought?) or is it being spent on maintaining new “official” loafers? V.

One addition, in my opinion, is essential: about the New Economic Policy.
I think it would be better to insert it (throwing light from different points of view on the place, the significance, the role in the general framework of the New Economic Policy) in the separate chapters.
Almost in every chapter you can (and should, in my belief) add a page or two about the fact that the New Economic Policy does not change the single state economic plan, and does not go beyond its framework, but alters the approach to its realisation.

KURSKY Comrade Kursky People’s Commissariat of Justice I have received two communications from the People’s Commissariat of Justice—of November 14 and December 20—on the “fulfilment” of my instruction to organise a systematic campaign against red tape.
In the first communication you write: “It involves a great deal of labour to single out the processes in which this organisational defect (viz.
, the ponderousness and bureaucratic complexity of our apparatus, inter-departmental relations, friction, etc.
) does not have such a decisive effect, and red tape is the result of the activity of persons, and not an objective consequence of the insufficiently smooth working of our apparatus.
” With such an approach, of course, nothing will come of the struggle against red tape.
It is the responsible persons who are to blame for these “organisational defects ” ; these, and no others, are the ones we must learn to prosecute and punish with exemplary severity.
You will never catch a saboteur engaged in red tape.
The second communication from the People’s Commis-sariat of Justice, signed by Krasikov, and the attached reports of the investigators of “exceptionally important cases”—Vyukov, Roizman and Kedrov, a member of the staff of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection—truly dis-cover America.
These reports, in a pretty illiterate form,set forth standard platitudes about bureaucracy, complexity of apparatus, etc.
, etc.
In a word, it is obvious that the struggle against red tape has not moved ahead one iota.
In essence, I have not received in exhaustive reply to a single one of the five tasks which I laid down.
I suggest that you once again examine the question and organise the struggle against red tape in business-like fashion, according to all the rules of war.
I ask you by the 20th of each month, without any pre-liminary reminders, to send me a report on the course of the campaign.

TSYURUPA 420 1 NEW ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS AND THE COUNCIL OF LABOUR AND DEFENCE January 24, 1922 Comrade Tsyurupa, In connection with our telephone conversation yesterday, and your promise to observe a strict regime, we need to have a detailed talk on the whole system of work, and to think it over thoroughly.
The most radical defect of the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
is the absence of any checking-up on fulfilment.
We are being sucked down by the rotten bureaucratic swamp into writing papers, jawing about decrees, drawing up decrees— and in this sea of paper live work is being drowned.
Clever saboteurs are deliberately luring us into this paper swamp.
Most of the People’s Commissars and other grandees are, quite unconsciously, “sticking their heads into the noose ” .
The strict medical regime laid down for you must be used at all costs to break away from turmoil and commotion, commissions, talking and writing of papers—to break away, to think over the system of work and radically reform it.
The centre of gravity of your activities must be just this refashioning of our disgustingly bureaucratic way of work, the struggle against bureaucracy and red tape, the checking-up on fulfilment.
The checking-up on fulfilment, the checking-up on whathappens in practice—this is your main and principal task.
You should set up for this a little staff (four-six persons) of particularly tried and tested assistants (an office manager, his assistants, a secretary and such like).
For this purpose, in my opinion, it is essential: (1) to relieve the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
of unnecessary burdens, transferring all petty questions to the Narrow Coun-cil of People’s Commissars and the procedural meetings of the C.
L.
D.
This has begun.
But it will “come apart” in two weeks, given our damned Oblomov ways, if it is not followed up, chased up, checked up, flogged along with three knouts.
The office manager must be taught (just as the Secretar-iat of the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
should be) to watch very closely to see that petty questions are not brought before the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
, and that all questions in general first go through a triple filter (an inquiry to the appro-priate People’s Commissariats; their urgent reply; the same from the Codification Department, etc.
, etc.
).
You and Gorbunov * must together work out written regulations for the bringing forward and consideration of questions, and check not less than once a month, you per-sonally, whether the regulations are being observed and whether they are achieving their object, i.
e.
, reduction of paper work, red tape, more forethought, more sense of res-ponsibility on the part of the People’s Commissars, replace-ment of half-baked decrees by careful, prolonged, business-like checking-up on fulfilment and by checking of experience, establishment of personal responsibility (in effect, we have complete irresponsibility at the top, in the People’s Commis-sariats and in their departments, and the saboteurs make magnificent use of this: as a result we have an Oblomov situation which wrecks all business).
I know that this is extraordinarily difficult.
But just because it is difficult, you must devote yourself entirely to this matter.
Hence (2) a minimum of sessions.
The standard should he once a week for the Council of People’s Commissars&once a week for the Council of Labour and Defence, two hours each.
* & a codifier & 1 from the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars.
(3) The Supreme Economic Commission.
Close down all its subcommissions as rapidly as possible, and replace them by demanding of the People’s Commissars that each of them should have responsible people to write drafts, that the People’s Commissar should endorse them, and that he himself should get them co-ordinated in the briefest possible time with all “interested” People’s Commissars and at the C.
L.
D.
or the C.
P.
C.
The Supreme Economic Commission should exist only for co-ordination (codification) and the most rapid checking (stamping) by yourself plus Kamenev.
Only for this.
Not for talk.
Not for discussion.
(4) You are not to become a member of a single commis-sion, not one, except the Supreme Economic Commission.
(5) To fight the outrageous abundance of commissions, replacing them by a formal demand for a written opinion in the shortest possible time.
(6) You must in this way set yourself free from commotion and turmoil, which are killing all of us, and make it possible for you to think calmly about the work as a whole— —and particularly to concentrate on checking-up on ful-filment, on fighting bureaucracy and red tape.
I beg you to think over this whole question, and to write to me.

I will try to formulate its programme in this way: (1) the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
to be made ten times more compact, in the sense that the People’s Commissars should not dare to bring trivial matters before them, but should decide them themselves and answer for them themselves; (2) the staff of the Managing Department of the C.
P.
C.
(at present three-quarters idle) should be made responsible for this, for putting this into effect; (3) the same applies to the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars, plus its especial reduction in size; (4) some of the members of the Narrow Council and its staff, and also the staff of the Managing Department of the C.
P.
C.
, to be taken by you under your personal command in order to check up on effective fulfilment (you instruct so-and-so: take a journey down there, look, read, check up, you will answer for any bungling through gullibility).
(5) You (and Rykov) must devote first and foremost one hour, or if your health permits, two, every day, to person-al checking-up on the work: you summon to your office (or visit) not grandees, but members of Collegiums and lower, practical workers of the People’s Commissariat of X, Y, Z—and check up on their work, get down to rock-bottom, school them, teach them, give them a proper trouncing.
Study people, search for able workers.
This is now the essence;all orders and decisions without this are dirty bits of paper.
Reply to me.
We shall think it over, consult with members of the Central Committee, and as rapidly as possible fix such a (or some other) programme.

My advice is to get brief comments from all People’s Commissars and all members of the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars.
Yours, Lenin A special supplementary decision should lay down: The principal task of the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars must be strict watchfulness that the People’s Commissariats (1) observe the laws, (2) do not evade respon-sibility by needlessly transferring a mass of unnecessary questions to the Narrow Council for decision, but should decide the questions themselves, on their own responsibili-ty or by agreement between two or more People’s Commis-sariats under ordinary procedure; (3) checking the legality, expediency and rapidity of individual instructions and acts of the People’s Commissariats; the struggle against bureauc-racy and red tape by such checking, and by persistent reduction of the number of officials.

As a result, they are floun-dering in bureaucracy instead of fighting it,: The causes of this evil are (1) the weakness of the Manag-ing Department, (2) the inability of the People’s Commissars to climb out of the mire of trivialities and bureaucratic details, (3) the desire of the People’s Commissars (and still more that of their departmental bureaucrats who egg them on) to shift responsibility on to the C.

, I have read Gorev’s work 422 and return it.
I expected more.
A former Bolshevik, who captivated you so, and who in your opinion had once again become a real Bolshevik, should have produced impressive, vivid, powerful, popular propaganda, a defence of communism for France, starting from her electrification.
But Gorev’s work has turned out “professorial”.
I offer the following plan for your consideration: (1) send it to be set at once, in order to publish it soon in any case; (2) suggest to Gorev—if you agree—that he should write in addition a preface or an afterword, in which he should in very clear and popular form and a little more freely (pre-scribe for him to this end three grammes of extract of Larin-ism they say it has appeared on sale in Moscow) attack French capitalism, and say to the French workers and peas-ants: you could become in three-five years three times as rich, and work not more than six hours a day (approximately), if there were a Soviet government in France putting electri-fication into effect; (3) if in your (or Gorev’s) opinion, Gorev will do this badly or unwillingly, then think over whether someone should not be asked to do this work separately (a brief “Ballod” 423 for France);(4) send me Gorev’s article, as soon as you can, once it is set up (to be published as a pamphlet or in some journal, whichever you choose).
Perhaps I will write an introduc-tion.

SOKOLNIKOV Top secret Comrade Sokolnikov Copy to Comrade Tsyurupa and Comrade Krzhizhanovsky You said to me that some of our trusts may, in the imme-diate future, find themselves without any money and ask us in an ultimatum to nationalise them.
I think that trusts and factories have been founded on a self-supporting basis precisely in order that they themselves should be responsi-ble and, moreover, fully responsible, for their enterprises working without a deficit.
If it turns out that they have not achieved this, then in my opinion they must be prosecuted and punished, as regards all the members of their boards of management, by prolonged terms of imprisonment (per-haps applying conditional release after a certain time), confiscation of all their property, etc.
If, after setting up trusts and enterprises on a self-support-ing basis, we do not prove able by business-like, mercantile methods fully to protect our interests, we shall turn out to be complete idiots.
The Supreme Economic Council must watch over this, but still more the People’s Commissariat of Finance through the State Bank and through special inspectors, since it is precisely the People’s Commissariat of Finance which, not being directly interested, is obliged to establish effective and real control and supervision.

SOKOLNIKOV February 15, 1922 Copy to Comrade Tsyurupa and Comrade Kamenev Comrade Sokolnikov, Should not the main attention be directed to the develop-ment of trade, and to supervision of it through the Trade Department of the State Bank? Should we not organise this matter so as to find two or three dozen (or even less, if our damned bureaucratic machine cannot cope with such a “difficult” task) represen-tatives of the Trade Department of the State Bank, and so that these representatives should receive bonuses in propor-tion to the growth of commercial turnover in those enter-prises or territorial regions which have been “entrusted” to them? It would seem to me that this would be more realistic than setting up special commissions or institutions which, given our rotten customs (with pretensions to “true commu-nism”), will inevitably degenerate into bureaucratic stupidity.
Meanwhile the Trade Department of the State Bank must be given a clear practical task—to develop internal trade and take it under its own control.
And for the development of operations let both the representatives and the members of the board (if there are members of the board in the Trade Department of the State Bank) receive their bonuses—but only for the development of operations.
Judging by what Gorbunov has told me about the results of his “troubles” over the Belov and GUM 425 affair, it is clear that the Trade Department of the State Bank is at fault here.
They slept in, they missed the bus, they waited, likereal jack-in-office scoundrels, for an order “from above”.
I think the Trade Department should be punished at once for this, where it hurts most, with the warning: one more such yawn, one more such display of sleepiness—and it means prison.
Another practical means, it would seem to me, is the regis-tration of private commercial deals and a tax on them, by means of a stamp duty or something similar.
How does this question stand? Cannot private trade be placed in such a way (or begin to be placed) under the control of the People’s Commissariat of Finance and the State Bank? I think that the success of the work of the entire People’s Commissariat of Finance should be measured 99 per cent by the development of state trade and of the Trade Department of the State Bank (in the granting of credit to private trade).
Everything else counts only 1 per cent.

SOKOLNIKOV February 22, 1922 Comrade Sokolnikov, The question is not just of GUM alone.
All the work of all our economic bodies suffers most of all from bureaucracy.
Communists have become bureaucrats.
If anything will destroy us, it is this.
And for the State Bank it is most dange-rous of all to be bureaucratic.
We are still thinking in terms of decrees, of institutions.
This is the mistake.
The whole essence now is practical men and practice.
To find people who are men of business (1 out of 100; 1 out of 1,000 Communists, and that only with God’s help); to transform our decrees out of dirty paper (it’s all the same whether they are bad or good decrees) into living practice—that is the essence.
Whether the State Bank itself should trade, or through subordinate firms, through its agents, or through its client debtors, etc.
—I don’t know.
I don’t take it upon myself to judge, because I am not sufficiently acquainted with the technique of currency circulation and banking business.
But what I do know firmly is that the whole problem now is the rapid development of state trade (in all its varieties: co-operation, clients of the State Bank, mixed companies, factors, agents, etc.
, etc.
).
February 28 On account of my illness I did not finish and send away this letter.
You speak (in your interview) about replacing state trusts by mixed companies.
There will be no practical results.
The clever capitalists will draw stupid (most honestand most virtuous) Communists into the mixed companies, and swindle us as they are swindling us now.
The problem now is not one of institutions but of people, and of checking up on practical experience.
One by one we must discover people who know how to trade, and step by step use their experience, their labour, to clean out the.
.
.
, expelling the virtuous Communists from boards of management, shutting down sleepy (and strictly communist) enterprises, shutting them down, separating out the one per cent which are worth while.
Either the People’s Commissariat of Finance will prove able to go over to such work, or the entire People’s Commissariat of Finance=0.

, Yesterday Martens 426 told me that the existence of an unheard-of wealth of iron deposits in Kursk Gubernia has been “proved” (you said “nearly”).
If that is so, should we not already this spring— (1) put down the necessary narrow-gauge lines there? (2) Prepare the nearest peatbog (or bogs?) for exploita-tion, so that an electric power station can be put up there? If this does not seem to you unnecessary, write to Martens about it (and two words to me).
Martens wants to go there in three weeks’ time.
I have written to Rykov and Tsyurupa that he should also be given an engineer from the State Planning Commission.
This business must be pushed ahead with particular energy.
I am very much afraid that without triple checks it will go to sleep.

STEINMETZ Moscow.
April 10, 1922 Dear Mr.
Steinmetz, I, thank you cordially for your friendly letter of February 16, 1922.
I must admit to my shame that I heard your name for the first time only a few months ago from Comrade Krzhi-zhanovsky, who was the Chairman of our State Commission for Working out a Plan for the Electrification of Russia and is now Chairman of the State General Planning Commission.
He told me of the outstanding position which you have gained among the electrical engineers of the whole world.
Comrade Martens has now made me better acquainted by his accounts of you.
I have seen from these accounts that your sympathies with Soviet Russia have been aroused, on the one hand, by your social and political views.
On the other hand, as a representative of electrical engineering and particularly in one of the technically advanced countries, you have become convinced of the necessity and inevitabili-ty of the replacement of capitalism by a new social order, which will establish the planned regulation of economy and ensure the welfare of the entire mass of the people on the basis of the electrification of entire countries.
In all the coun-tries of the world there is growing—more slowly than one would like, but irresistibly and unswervingly—the number of representatives of science, technology, art, who are becom-ing convinced of the necessity of replacing capitalism by a different socio-economic system, and whom the “terrible difficulties” * of the struggle of Soviet Russia against the * These words were written by Lenin in English.
—Ed.
entire capitalist world do not repel, do not frighten away but, on the contrary, lead to an understanding of the inevitabili-ty of the struggle and the necessity of taking what part in it they can, helping the new to overcome the old.
In particular, I want to thank you for your offer to help Russia with your advice, suggestions, etc.
As the absence of official and legally recognised relations between Soviet Russia and the United States makes the practical realisa-tion of your offer extremely difficult both for us and for you, I will allow myself to publish both your letter and my reply, in the hope that many persons who live in America, or in countries connected by commercial treaties both with the United States and with Russia, will then help you (by infor-mation, by translations from Russian into English, etc.
) to give effect to your intention of helping the Soviet Republic.

Now, why print stupidities in the guise of the article by Pletnyov, 427 who puts on pompous airs with all the learned and fashionable words he can? I have marked two stupidities and put a number of question marks.
The author has to learn not “proletarian” science, but simply to learn.
Can it be that the editorial board of Pravda is not going to explain the author’s mistakes to him? Why, this is falsification of historical materialism! Playing at histori-cal materialism!

Krasin Comrade Krasin has sent me a letter in which he tells me of the very great successes of a group of engineers, head-ed by Comrade Gubkin, who, with stubbornness bordering on the heroic, and with insignificant support by state organ-isations, have not only developed from zero the detailed scientific investigation of combustible slates and sapropelite, but have also learned in practice to produce out of these minerals various useful products, such as ichthyol, black varnish, various soaps, paraffins, ammonium sulphate, etc.
In view of the fact that this work, as Comrade Krasin testifies, represents a firm foundation for an industry which in ten or twenty years will produce hundreds of millions for Russia, I propose that: (1) the further development of this work be immediately guaranteed in the financial sense;(2) all obstacles retarding it be eliminated, now and henceforth; (3) this group of engineers be awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour and a large sum of money.

SKVORTSOV-STEPANOV Dear Ivan Ivanovich, I have read your article about specialists.
428 I don’t agree.
Two points.
The first is at the beginning (the third column from the beginning): “The proletarian dictatorship will collapse if, in the first place.
.
.
* ” (this is correct) “and secondly, if these specialists are not our own specialists, such as see their aim to be the consolidation and development of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
” What I have underlined is incorrect.
We shall not have such specialists for a long time, until the bourgeois specialists, the petty-bourgeois specialists have disap-peared, until all the specialists have become Commu-nists.
Yet the proletarian dictatorship must certainly not “collapse” in the meantime.
A lesser condition will be enough—namely, the first.
The second does not imperil our existence.
It is sufficient to “have at our disposal”.
For a long time yet there will be doubts, uncertainty, intrigues, betrayals, etc.
The second condition will last until the end of the dictatorship, and therefore is not a condition of the dictatorship.
Now the second point, at the end of the article, the third and second paragraphs from the end.
“The class struggle .
.
.
no more abnormal than the rela-tions which it expresses”.
429 * Lenin refers to the following passage: “.
.
.
in the first place, it does not have at its disposal well-qualified specialists of the most diverse categories”.
—Ed.
Untrue.
It is untrue, and not merely abnormal.
It is worse than abnormal: it is scientifically untrue.
This is not the class struggle.
Further.
“The scientific laboratory is a united collective, acting co-ordinately, concertedly and consciously in all its elements.
” Untrue.
This cannot be the case before the abolition of classes.
This is not scientific but sentimental: before classes have been abolished, “share and share alike ” in everything.
Wrong.
It will degenerate into the practices of 1918: medical assistants demand that doctors should “share and share alike” in everything (scientific).
This is both wrong and practically harmful.
An example: the Political Bureau and its girl secretaries.
“Share and share alike” in everything (scientific)? You your-self will not insist on that.
You have been carried away.

1 0 Printed from the original321 TO COMRADE MÜNZENBERG, SECRETARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORKERS’ AID 430 Supplementing your report at the Fourth Congress of the Comintern, I should like in a few words to point out the significance of the organisation of aid.
The assistance given to the starving by the international working class helped Soviet Russia in considerable measure to endure the painful days of last year’s famine and to over-come it.
At the present time we have to heal the wounds inflicted by the famine, provide in the first place for many thousands of orphaned children, and restore our agriculture and industry which have suffered heavily as a result of the famine.
In this sphere, too, the fraternal aid of the international working class has already begun to operate.
The American tractor column near Perm, the agricultural groups of the Amer-ican Technical Aid, the agricultural and industrial under-takings of the International Workers’ Aid, the allocation of and subscriptions to the first proletarian loan, through the Workers’ Aid to Soviet Russia—all these are very promising beginnings in the cause of workers’ fraternal aid to promote the economic restoration of Soviet Russia.
The work of economic assistance, so happily begun by the International Workers’ Aid to Soviet Russia, should be supported in every possible way by the workers and toilers of the whole world.
Side by side with the continuing strong political pressure on the governments of the bourgeois coun-tries over the demand for recognition of the Soviet government,widespread economic aid by the world proletariat is at present the best and most practical support of Soviet Russia in her difficult economic war against the imperialist concerns, and the best support for her work of building a socialist economy.

p.
39 37Pravda (Truth)—the first legal mass workers’ daily in Russia.
The first issue appeared in St.
Petersburg on May 5, 1912.
Pravda played a key role in the history of the Bolshevik Party and the revolution.
It was a collective propagandist, agitator and organiser in the struggle to put the Party’s policy into practice.
As a centre of the campaign for Party principles, it fought reso-lutely against the Menshevik liquidators, otzovists and Trotskyists and opposed international opportunism.
Pravda helped to build a firm foundation for a mass Bolshevik party.
Lenin guided the policy of Pravda, which published 270 of his articles.
The paper was closed down eight times by the tsarist government but continued to appear under fresh names: Rabochaya Pravda (Workers’ Truth), Severnaya Pravda (Northern Truth), Pravda Truda (Truth of Labour), Za Pravdu (For Truth), Prole-tarskaya Pravda (Proletarian Truth), Put Pravdy (Path of Truth), Rabochy (The Worker), and Trudovaya Pravda (Labour Truth).
Before the outbreak of the first world war, on July 21, 1914, the paper was banned and did not recommence publication until after the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917.

N.
(1859-1943)—leader of the Constitutional-Democratic (Cadet) Party, prominent ideologist of the Russian impe-rialist bourgeoisie.

He was a member of the Third and Fourth Dumas.
After the Febru-ary bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the bourgeois Provisional Government, and after the October Socialist Revolution helped to organise the foreign military intervention against Soviet Russia.
Later he was active among the White émigrés.

p.
50 52Socialist-Revolutionary Party (S.
R.
s)—a petty-bourgeois party in Russia; emerged at the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 as a result of the union of various Narodnik groups and circles.
The S.
R.
s did not recognise the class differences between the prole-tariat and the small owners.
They glossed over the class differentia-tion and contradictions within the peasantry and denied the lead-ing role of the proletariat in the revolution.
The tactics of individ-ual terrorism which the S.
R.
s advocated as the main form of struggle against the autocracy did great harm to the revolutionary movement and made it more difficult to organise the masses for revolutionary struggle.
The Bolshevik Party exposed the S.
R.
s’ attempts to masquerade as socialists, waged a determined struggle against them for influence over the peasantry, and exposed the harm caused to the working-class movement by their tactics of individual terrorism.
At the same time the Bolsheviks, under certain conditions, made temporary agreements with the S.
R.
s in the struggle against tsarism.
The heterogeneity of the peasantry as a class determined the political and ideological instability and organisational disunity of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and their constant wavering between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
In the period of reaction (1907-10) the S.
R.
s suffered complete ideological and organ-isational collapse.
During the first world war the majority of them became social-chauvinists.
After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revolu-tion in 1917, the S.
R.
s together with the Mensheviks and the Cadets were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois-landowner Provisional Government, and their leaders (Kerensky, Avksentyev, Chernov) were members of it.
The S.
R.
Party refused to support the peasant demand for abolition of the landed estates and came out in favour of landed proprietorship.
The S.
R.
ministers in the Provisional Government sent punitive expeditions against peasants who had seized the landowners’ estates.
At the end of November 1917, the Left wing of the party formed the independent party of Left S.
R.
s.
In an attempt to preserve their influence over the mass of the peasants, the Left S.
R.
s form-ally recognised Soviet power and came to an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but soon joined the struggle against Soviet power.
During the years of foreign intervention and civil war, the S.
R.
s engaged in counter-revolutionary subversion, actively supported the interventionists and whiteguards, participated in counter-revolutionary conspiracies, and organised terrorist acts against lead-ers of the Soviet state and the Communist Party.
After the Civil War the S.
R.
s continued their hostile activities against the Soviet state.
p.
50 53Trudovik group (Trudoviks)—group of petty-bourgeois democrats in the Duma, consisting of peasants and intellectuals with a Narodnik orientation.
Their politics were the class politics of the small peasant farmer and the Trudoviks in the Duma wavered between the Cadets and Social-Democrats.
Since the Trudoviks did to some extent repre-sent the peasant masses, the Bolsheviks in the Duma adopted tactics of co-operating with them, in certain fields, for the sake of the common struggle against tsarist autocracy and the Cadets.
p.
50 54Bezzaglavtsi—semi-Cadet, semi-Menshevik group of the Russian bourgeois intelligentsia, formed when the revolution of 1905-07 was on the wane.
It took its name from the political weekly Bez Zaglaviya (Without a Title) published in St.
Petersburg between January and May 1906.
Under cover of their formal non-attachment to any party, the Bezzaglavtsi advocated bourgeois-liberal and opportunist ideas, and supported the revisionists in the Russian p.
50 and international Social-Democratic movement.
55Cadets—members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the leading party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia.
Founded in October 1905, it represented the bourgeoisie, landown-ers and bourgeois intellectuals.
The Cadets wanted to make a deal with tsarism.
They advocated a constitutional monarchy, opposed the slogan of a republic and insisted on preservation of the landed estates.
During the world war of 1914-18 they became ideologists of imperialism and supported the expansionist policy of tsarism.
After the victory of the October Socialist Revolution the Cadets took an active part in all armed counter-revolutionary actions and in the interventionist campaigns against Soviet Russia.

planned to organise in 1913, during the Duma’s summer recess, for members of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, workers and Party activists.
Lenin intended giving an important series of lectures on political economy, the theory and practice of socialism in Russia, and on the agrarian and nationalities problems.
Difficulties, such as lack of funds, etc.

p.
69 73Machism, or empirio -criticism—a reactionary subjective-idealist philosophical trend which became widespread in Western Europe at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.
Its founders were the Austrian physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach and the German philosopher Richard Avenarius.
In Russia, during the years of reaction, the influence of Machism made itself felt among some intellectuals of the R.

, parti-cularly Menshevik intellectuals (N.
Valentinov, P.
Yushkevich and others).
Some literary men among the Bolsheviks also adopt-ed Machist positions (V.
Bazarov, A.
Bogdanov and others).
Though they claimed to advocate Marxism, the Russian Machists (Zamyatin, N.
I.
) (1877-1927)—one of the editors of p.
65were trying to revise the fundamental principles of Marxist philos-ophy.
In his book Materialism and Empirio-criticism Lenin revealed the reactionary essence of Machism, defended Marxist philosophy from revisionist attacks and in the new historical conditions obtaining at the time pushed forward the development of dialec-tical and historical materialism in all respects.
The defeat of Machism was a crippling blow to the ideology of Menshevism, otzovism and god-building.
God-building—a religious-philosophical trend hostile to Marx-ism.
It arose during the period of reaction among certain Party intellectuals who departed from Marxism after the defeat of the 1905-07 revolution.
The god-builders (A.
V.
Lunacharsky, V.
Baza-rov and others) advocated a new “socialist” religion and tried to reconcile Marxism with religion.
Maxim Gorky was at one time associated with them.

he joined the Bolsheviks and was elected a member of the Central Committee.
He was on the editorial boards of the Bolshevik news-papers Vperyod and Proletary, and worked as an editor of the Bolshevik newspaper Novaya Zhizn.
In the years of reaction (1907-10) and the subsequent revolutionary revival he headed the otzovists, and the Vperyod anti-Party group.
In philosophy he tried to create his own system of “empirio-monism” (a variety of subjective-idealist philosophy), which Lenin criticised sharply in his Materialism and Empirio-criticism.
At a meeting of the enlarged editorial board of the newspaper Proletary in June 1909 Bogdanov was expelled from the Bolshevik Party.
After the October Socialist Revolution he became one of the organisers and leaders of the Proletcult (Proletarian Culture Organisation).
From 1926 onwards he was director of the Blood-Transfusion Institute which he had founded.
Bazarov, V.
(real name Rudnev, V.
A.

In April 1918 he fled the country.
p.
71 77Otzovism (from the Russian “otozvat”—to recall)—opportunist trend among the Bolsheviks, which was led by A.
Bogdanov.
Under cover of revolutionary phrases the otzovists (besides Bog-danov the group included G.
A.
Alexinsky, S.
Volsky, A.
V.
Luna-charsky and M.
N.
Lyadov) demanded the recall of the Social-Democratic deputies from the Third Duma.
They also refused to work in legal organisations.
Declaring that under conditions of reaction the Party should conduct only illegal work, the otzo-vists refused to participate in the Duma, the trade unions, the co-operatives or any mass legal and semi-legal organisations.
A variety of otzovism was ultimatumism.
The ultimatumists proposed that the Social-Democratic deputies in the Duma should be presented with an ultimatum demanding implicit obedience to the decisions of the Party Central Committee and, if they rejected it, that they should be recalled.
Ultimatumism was actually a masked form of otzovism.
Lenin called the ultimatum-ists “bashful otzovists”.
The otzovists caused great harm to the Party.
Their policy would have isolated the Party from the masses and converted it into a sectarian organisation.

The call to make collections for the paper was enthusiasti-cally supported by the workers, but its appearance was delayed by the arrest, in February 1913, of the group of Bolsheviks who were starting it.
The first number of Nash Put appeared on August 25 (September 7), 1913.
Lenin was active on the paper.
Its contributors included Maxim Gorky, Demyan Bedny, M.

“Since then more than a month has passed.
In all this time Luch has acted in constant and rabid opposition to anti-liqui-dationism.
We consider its advocacy of an ‘open’ workers’ party and its attacks on the underground, in the present conditions of Russian life, impermissible and harmful.
“Since we find it impossible to allow our names to be used as a cover for the liquidationist views advocated by Luch we request the editors to remove us from the list of its contributors” (Luch No.

204In his report to the conference on “The War and the Tasks of the Party” Lenin dealt with the most vital questions of Bolshevik strategy and tactics during the imperialist war.
Bukharin put forward theses in defence of anti-Marxist views, which Lenin characterised as a trend of “imperialist Eco-nomism”.
The conference passed the resolutions written by Lenin on the character of the war, on the slogan “defence of the fatherland”, on the slogans of revolutionary Social-Democracy, on the attitude to other parties and groups, etc.

310 298Lenin stresses the responsibility borne by Kamenev because Kamenev, who had returned to Petrograd from exile on March 12, 1917, had become one of the editors of Pravda and a representa-tive of the Bolshevik Party in the Petrograd Soviet.
Kamenev, however, adopted a semi-Menshevik position on certain vital aspects of Party policy.
In articles published in Pravda he argued that the Bolsheviks should give the Provisional Government conditional support, while exerting pressure to make it open peace negotiations at once.
In his assessment of the war Ka-menev leaned towards defencism.

On May 4 Lenin proposed to the C.
C.
of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) that the judges who had passed such a lenient sentence should be expelled from the Party.
Acting on the instructions given by Lenin in this letter, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted a decision obliging the People’s Commissariat of Justice “immediately” to draw up a Bill stipulating a “heavy minimum sentence for bribery and any connivance in bribery”.
The Commissariat of Justice’s Bill was discussed by the C.

331 318The defeat of the anti-Soviet revolt of the Mussavatists at the end of March 1918 consolidated Soviet power in Baku.
A meeting of the Baku Soviet on April 25 set up the Baku Council of People’s Com-missars, which besides Bolsheviks included some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Shahumyan was made Chairman of the Baku Council of People’s Commissars and Commissar for Foreign Affairs.
The Council launched a number of socialist projects.
In April and May 1918 Soviet power was established over a considerable part of Azerbaijan.
The Azerbaijan workers’ and peasants’ struggle for the victory of socialist revolution was waged in an extremely complex situation.
The German-Turkish intervention had begun in the Transcaucasus and Turkish troops had invaded Azerbaijan.
On the other hand, the British Command in Iran had made contact with the Baku Dashnaks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, in the hope of using them to take over Baku and overthrow Soviet power in the city.
Lenin therefore instructed the leaders of the Baku Coun-cil of People’s Commissars to be extremely flexible in taking advantage of the contradictions within the imperialist camp and within the nationalist parties.
p.
332319Lenin refers to the decision of the Council of People’s Commis-sars, passed on November 18 (December 1), 1917, “On the Remuner-ation of People’s Commissars, Senior Government Employees and Officials”, which he had drafted.
It set the maximum monthly salary for Commissars at 500 rubies with an allowance of 100 rubles for each member of the family unable to work.

On August 30, M.

The same day a villainous attempt to assassinate Lenin was made by the Socialist-Revolutionary terrorist Kaplan.
Lenin was gravely wounded by two poisoned bullets.

336 321This telegram was the last warning to A.
M.
Yuriev (Alexeyev), Chairman of the Murmansk Territory Soviet, where the Menshe-viks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had a majority.
On March 2, 1918 Yuriev had violated the instructions of the Soviet Govern-ment by entering into negotiations with representatives of the Entente and concluding a so-called “verbal agreement” with them, which virtually placed the Territory’s military forces and economy in the hands of the “Allies” and enabled the imperialists of Brit-ain, France and the United States to land troops in Murmansk.
Despite several warnings from the Soviet Government Yuriev persisted in his criminal policy.
On June 26 he sent Lenin a radio message demanding further concessions to the interventionists.
Lenin’s reply was the telegram published here.

339 323The German Ambassador Mirbach was assassinated in the after-noon on July 6 by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries Blyumkin and Andreyev, who got into the German Embassy with a forgeddocument for the alleged purpose of negotiating with the Ambassa-dor and threw a bomb at him.
The Left S.
R.
s hoped by this act to provoke a war with Germany and be able to overthrow Soviet power through the combined efforts of all the enemies of the revo-lution.
The assassination of Mirbach marked the beginning of the Left S.
R.
counter-revolutionary revolt in Moscow, July 6-7, 1918, which was part of a general onslaught by internal counter-revolu-tionaries and the imperialists of the Entente against Soviet Rus-sia; the rebels were secretly supported by foreign diplomatic missions.
The revolt occurred during the Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, which instructed the Government to suppress the revolt at once.
The group of Left S.
R.
delegates to the Congress was arrest-ed.
Thanks to the vigorous measures taken by the Soviet Govern-ment and the concerted action of Moscow workers and garrison, the revolt was put down.
p.

Stalin sent from Tsaritsyn to Shahumyan on July 20, 1918.
In this telegram Stalin con-demned the policy of the Mensheviks, Dashnaks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in the Baku Soviet, who, on the pretext of defending the city from the advancing Turkish army, advocated inviting the “assistance” of British troops.
On behalf of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, Stalin demanded that the Baku Council of People’s Commissars should unconditionally implement the decisions of the Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on an independent foreign policy and resolute opposition to the agents of foreign capital.

The group carried on revo-lutionary propaganda among the masses, organised anti-war de-monstrations, led strikes, and exposed the imperialist nature of the war and the treachery of the opportunist Social-Democratic lead-ers.
In April 1917, the group joined the centrist Independent So-cial-Democratic Party of Germany, while maintaining its organi-sational independence.
In November 1918, during the revolution in Germany, the group renamed itself the Spartacus League; on December 14, 1918 it published its own programme and broke with the “Independents”.
At the Inaugural Congress held December 30, 1918 to January 1, 1919 the Spartacists founded the Commu-nist Party of Germany.

344 327This telegram was Lenin’s reply to a telegram from Baku reporting the advance of the Turkish troops and the treacherous activities ofthe Dashnaks, wad also the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolution-aries, who at an extraordinary meeting of the Baku Soviet on July 25, 1918, in spite of energetic protests by Bolshevik leaders of Soviet power in the city, had managed to gain an insignificant majority for a resolution inviting the British to give Baku military “assistance”.
After the passing of this resolution, the Bolsheviks declared that they would resign their posts as People’s Commissars.
They con-tinued, however, to fight for Soviet power.
At an emergency meet-ing of the Executive Committee of the Baku Soviet on July 26, 1918 it was decided that until the question of power was finally settled all People’s Commissars should remain at their posts.
The All-Baku Conference of Bolsheviks held on July 27 resolved that emergency measures should be taken to defend Bake under the leadership of the C.

p.
346 329On July 31, 1918 external pressure and various internal factors brought about the temporary collapse of Soviet power in Baku.
On August 1, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Dash-naks Organised a counter-revolutionary government known as the Dictatorship of the Central Caspian Area.
Agents of the Entente, they immediately sent their representatives to Iran to fetch the British, and on August 4 a British force landed in Baku.
In these critical days the Baku Communists were with the mass-es, explaining the situation and exposing the treacherous policy of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Dashnaks; but the Baku Communists lacked the strength and opportunity to bring about any fundamental change in the political situation.
On August 12, a Communist conference took the decision to withdraw temporarily to Astrakhan, taking as many arms and as much equip-ment as possible.
A group of Communists was appointed to carry on Party work in Baku.
The plan of evacuation to Astrakhan did not succeed and the leaders of Soviet power in Baku were arrested.
In the middle of September 1918 the Turkish command launched an offensive on Baku.
The troops of the Dictatorship of theCentral Caspian Area and the British force withdrew, and on the morning of September 15 Turkish troops and Mussavatists entered the city.
The previous day a group of Communists had managed to get the Commissars and other Bolsheviks out of prison.
They escaped from the city aboard the steamer Turkmen, but on September 17 the crew, which had counter-revolutionary leanings, brought the ship into Krasnovodsk port, where the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and British interventionists were in command.
All the members of the Baku Council of People’s Commissars and other Party workers were immediately arrested.
On the night of Septem-ber 19, 1918, twenty-six leaders of the Baku Commune, who have since become known in history as the twenty-six Baku Commis-sars (S.

p.
359 332Reference is to the article “Karl Kautsky and Henriette Roland-Holst on the Bolsheviks”, published an September 20, 1918 in Pravda.

The magazine was the organ of the Kautskians.
It was published in Berlin from 1915 to 1922 (after November 1918, under p.
362 the title of Der Sozialist).
333Kautsky’s pamphlet The Dictatorship of the Proletariat was pub-lished in Vienna in the autumn of 1918.
It distorted the Marxist theory of the proletarian revolution and slandered the Soviet state.
Lenin in his book The Proletarian Revolution and the Ren-egade Kautsky and other works of this period castigated the leaders of the Second International, particularly Kautsky, for their distortion of Marxist teaching on the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and further developed Marxist theory on these vital questions.

His main proposals were includ-ed in the resolution passed by the meeting, which on the same day was officially announced to the world by telegraph.
p.
365 335Lenin was prompted to write this letter by the decision of the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet of October 7, 1918, in which the leaders of the Soviet attempted to avoid responsibility for not carrying out the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars on setting up in Moscow monuments to outstanding figures in the revolutionary movement and the world of culture.

Antonov-Ovseyenko and others), prompted by nar-row, local interests, held up the transfer of troops to the Donets sector.
Antonov-Ovseyenko, Commander of the Ukrainian Front, demanded that the lines of demarcation between the Ukrainian Front and the Southern Front in the Donets Basin should be revised, and that the bulk of the forces operating in this area should be placed under his command, and refused to recognise the major importance of the Donets sector, claiming that the Ukrainian Front was confronted by more important tasks in the western and southern Ukraine.
Lenin rejected his proposal.
p.
383 343Reference is to the highly nationalistic resolution passed by the Ekaterinoslav organisation of the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolution-aries, who opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, the policy of the Soviet Government, and the political, economic and milita-ry alliance between the Ukraine and Soviet Russia.

387 346At time beginning of May 1919, the threat of an offensive by White Finnish troops made it necessary to mobilise the working people of Petrograd in defence of the city.
Some of the Petrograd leaders, however, including G.
Y.
Zinoviev, Chairman of time city’s Defence Committee, underestimated the strength and ability of the defend-ers.
In a mood of panic they decided, without informing the Defence Council, to evacuate several factories, and were preparing to scut-tle the Baltic Fleet.
Workers were mobilised haphazardly with the result that many factories of great defence importance had to slow down.
The telegram sent by Lenin was on behalf of the Defence Council.
The draft of it was signed by L.

The party held an emergency congress in Leipzig from November 30 to December 6, 1919, at which under pressure from Left-wing members of the party a programme of action recognising the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the system of Soviets was adopted.
The party’s proletarian wing also proposed “immediate and unconditional join-ing of the Third International”.
In October 1920 at the Independent Social-Democratic Party’s congress in Halle a split occurred, and in December 1920 a large section of the party joined the Communist Party of Germany.
The Right-wing elements formed a separateparty, retaining the old title Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany; this party existed until 1922.

p.
482 399Reference is to NEP (New Economic Policy)—the policy of the proletarian state during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism.
This policy was “new” in contrast to the economic pol-icy which had been conducted in Soviet Russia in the period of foreign military intervention and the Civil War, known in histo-ry as the policy of War Communism (1918-20).
The latter was made necessary by war-time conditions, and its characteristic fea-tures were extreme centralisation of production and distribution of goods, prohibition of free trading, and food requisitioning which compelled the peasants to turn in all surplus produce to the state.
When the New Economic Policy was adopted, commodity-money relations became the basic form of relations between social-ist industry and the small-peasant economy.
When food requisi-tioning was abolished and replaced by the tax in kind, the peasants were able to dispose of their surplus produce as they chose, i.
e.
, sell them at the market, and through the market obtain the indus-trial goods they required.
The New Economic Policy was calculated to achieve a firm eco-nomic and political alliance between the working class and the peasantry for the building of socialism, for the development of the productive forces along socialist lines.
It provided for a certain measure of capitalism while the basic economic positions remained in the hands of the proletarian state.
It assumed the struggle of the socialist elements against the capitalist elements, the victory of the socialist elements, the elimination of the exploiting classes, and the building of socialism in the U.

504 407Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Rabkrin) was set up in Feb-ruary 1920 on Lenin’s initiative, on the basis of the reorganised People’s Commissariat of State Control, which had been formed in the early months of Soviet power.
Lenin attached great impor-tance to control and verification at all levels.
He worked out in detail the principles of organising control in the Soviet state, kept an eye on Rabkrin’s activity, criticised its shortcomings and did his best to make it more efficient.
In his last articles, “How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection” and “Better Fewer, but Better”, Lenin outlined a plan for reor-ganising Rabkrin.
The basic principles of Lenin’s plan were to merge Party and state control and to enlist more workers and peasants in its activities.
