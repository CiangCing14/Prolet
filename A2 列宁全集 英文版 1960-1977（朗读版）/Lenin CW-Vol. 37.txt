PREFACE This volume contains 274 personal letters, telegrams and notes from Vladimir Ilyich Lenin to his relatives.
They were written between 1893 and 1922, to his mother, Maria Ale-xandrovna Ulyanova, his sisters, Anna and Maria, his brother, Dmitry, his brother-in-law, Mark Timofeyevich Yelizarov (husband of Anna Ulyanova), and his wife, Nadezhda Kon-stantinovna Krupskaya.
Many of these letters were published in the journal Pro-letarskaya Revolyutsiya for the years 1924, 1929 and 1930 and in Lenin Miscellanies Nos.
III, XXIV, XXV, XXXV; separate editions of the Letters to Relatives, edited by Lenin’s sisters, were published in 1930, 1931 and 1934.
The Preface to the 1930 edition by Maria Ulyanova and the article by Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova, “Apropos of Lenin’s Letters to Relatives”, which formed the preface to the 1931 and 1934 editions, discuss the content and significance of the letters; these two articles precede the letters in the present volume.
Lenin wrote to his mother and to other relatives at least once in every week or ten days.
The longer intervals between letters in this volume show that a considerable number of letters have been lost.
Most of Lenin’s letters were written before the revolution, a time when his relatives were sub-jected to frequent house searches and arrests.
Many of his letters fell into the hands of the secret police and bear traces of their examination—passages of interest to the police are underlined in red pencil, etc.
Some of the letters seized during searches were not returned, some were found after the revolution in police dossiers; only odd pages of some letters have survived.
Many letters were lost duringthe First World War (1914-1917), when letters from abroad were subjected to a particularly strict scrutiny by the censors.
The periods best represented are the late nineties, when Lenin was writing his Economic Studies and Essays and The Development of Capitalism in Russia, and the years 1908-09 when he was preparing his Materialism and Empirio-criticism; in these years Lenin’s letters concerned the des-patch to him of the literature he needed, and contained instructions on how the books should be published and on correction of the proofs.
Almost all the letters are printed from the originals; in a few cases, however, they have been printed from copies in the files of the Police Department in the form (in full or as extracts) in which they were found there.
Eleven of the letters were published for the first time in the Fourth Russian Edition of the Collected Works, from which the translation of this volume has been made (these letters are marked with an asterisk in the table of contents).
In the letter to his mother dated July 1, 1912, Lenin mentions that he is moving from Paris to Krakow.
This change of address was necessary to bring him closer to St.
Petersburg, the centre of the working-class movement, so that he could improve contacts with Pravda and with the Bolshevik group in the Fourth Duma, and carry out the day-to-day work involved in his guidance of the Party organisations.
In his letter of July 15, 1919, addressed to the propaganda boat Krasnaya Zvezda, Lenin informed his wife of the situation obtaining on the Eastern Front—the capture of Yekaterinburg (now Sverdlovsk)—and also of the great change then taking place in the South.
Among the items first published in the Fourth Edition are some brief notes addressed to his wife and to his sister Maria between 1919 and 1922.
Fifty-four letters addressed by Lenin’s wife to his mother and sisters are given as an Appendix to this volume; these letters describe Lenin’s way of life when he was in exile in Siberia and when he was living abroad and help to elu-cidate certain facts mentioned in Lenin’s letters; eight of Krupskaya’s letters were published for the first time inthe Fourth Russian Edition of the Collected Works.
These are also marked with an asterisk in the table of contents, Letters written jointly by Lenin and his wife are con-tained in the body of the volume.
The items are arranged chronologically; letters posted in Russia are dated according to the Old Style, those from abroad according to the New Style; the editors have added dates at the end of undated letters.
The source and destina-tion of the letter and, where necessary, the date are indi-cated by the editors at the end of each letter; below this, information is given on where the letter was first published in Russian.
It should be borne in mind that the note on printing given on the right of the page refers always to the Russian original, not to the translation.
The volume is furnished with a name index, a list of literature mentioned in the letters, and explanatory notes.
The illustrations include photographs of Lenin’s relatives and some of the places where he lived.
Facsimiles of two of Lenin’s letters are also given.
PREFACE TO L E T T E R S T O R E L A T I V E S (1930 EDITION) The letters in this collection are addressed mainly to Lenin’s mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, and to me * and cover the period from 1894 to 1917, ** i.
e.
, they begin from the first years of Lenin’s revolutionary activi-ties and continue up to his return to Russia after the Feb-ruary Revolution.
It was in this period, almost a quarter of a century, that our Party emerged and took shape.
Through-out this remarkable period of twenty-five years, Vladimir Ilyich stood at the head of the Party, guiding and nurturing it.
His entire life was one of revolutionary struggle and his private life was part of that struggle, part of his labour on behalf of the cause of the proletariat.
We have a complete edition of Lenin’s Collected Works and a fairly extensive literature on Leninism (works of * What was in the letters, however, was usually intended for the whole family, or at least for those members who were living together at the time, “so as not to repeat myself”, as Lenin put it.
** The collection does not include the correspondence between Lenin and his relatives during his period of exile (for which see Pro-letarskaya Revolyutsiya Nos.
2-3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 for 1929), or that of 1896, when he was in the remand prison in St.
Petersburg (December 9, 1895 to January 29, 1897, O.
S.
) and was frequently visited by his mother and sisters, so that his personal correspondence with them was insignificant (see the article by A.
I.
Ulyanova-Yelizarova “Vla-dimir Ilyich in Prison” in Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.
3 for 1924 and the two letters of Lenin written in 1896 that are appended to the article).
Between November 1905 and December 1907, Lenin lived in St.
Petersburg or in Finland, saw his relatives frequently and wrote to them rarely.
There are also many letters addressed to his sister Anna and his mother, especially at the time when I was living abroad.
These letters will be published separately.
(All the letters indicated by Maria Ulyanova as being omitted from the 1930 col-lection have been incorporated in the present volume.
—Ed.
)scientific research and popular writings) but Lenin the man, with his brilliant, all-round individuality, has been but little described or, rather, has scarcely been described at all.
The letters here offered to the reader to some extent fill this gap.
They enable the reader to form to some extent a picture of Lenin’s life, his habits, inclinations, attitude to people, etc.
We say here “to some extent”, mainly because the collection of letters to his relatives in this period is far from complete.
During the frequent moves from town to town, the numerous house searches and arrests to which first one, then another member of our family was subjected, many of the letters fell into the hands of the police and were not returned * or were lost in some other way.
There were also frequent cases of letters going astray in the post, espe-cially during the imperialist war.
For this reason one and the same question is repeated in a number of successive letters.
These letters, furthermore, bear the imprint of police conditions in tsarist times.
It is true that all our official correspondence (all communications concerning revolutionary events, party life, etc.
) was conducted sec-retly, in invisible ink and usually in books and journals, sent through other, “clean” addresses.
** Our personal lives were so closely bound up with revolutionary work that our legal, personal correspondence no doubt suffered badly and we cut it down because of police conditions.
Vladimir Ilyich had good reason to write to me, when I was in exile in Vologda, that “as far as letter-writing is concerned—it is very difficult in our situation (in yours and mine especially) to carry on the correspondence one would like”.
*** This applied equally, to all our family and not only to me, because Vladimir Ilyich was not only a blood relation but was related to us by his views and convictions.
All * In the Central Archives, for instance, we found extracts from six of Lenin’s letters that had been placed in the files of the Moscow Gen-darmerie as “material evidence ” .
These extracts are published as an appendix to this volume (see pp.
553-54).

** It was, of course, impossible to keep them in Russia and only a few have been preserved in copies made abroad.

the family (including Anna’s husband, Mark Yelizarov) were at that time Social-Democrats, supported the revo-lutionary wing of the Party, took a greater or lesser part in revolutionary activities, were keenly interested in the life of the Party and were delighted at its successes and grieved by its failures.
Even our mother, who was born in 1835 and who was over sixty at the end of the century, when house searches and arrests became particularly frequ-ent, showed full sympathy for our revolutionary activities.
All the legal correspondence of revolutionaries was exam-ined by the police and recourse had to be made to various hints, secret signs, etc.
, in some way to touch upon ques-tions that interested us, confirm the receipt of some illegal letter, make enquiries about acquaintances and so on.
The reader will notice that letters sent by Vladimir Ilyich to his mother, sisters or brother contain scarcely any names, because the use of names might involve those mentioned in unpleasantness.
It stands to reason that we had not the slightest desire to do anything that would, at best, make things unpleasant for someone.
The names and surnames that do, on rare occasions, occur in Vladimir Ilyich’s let-ters are those of comrades and friends whose connection with us was in any case known to the police owing to various circumstances (exile together on the same charge, attendance at the same educational establishment, etc.
) or had to do with purely business matters (names of publishers, booksellers, etc.
).
To avoid mentioning the names of any-body living in more or less legal conditions about whom Vladimir Ilyich wanted to tell us something, to whom he wanted to send regards, etc.
, he made frequent use in his letters of nicknames and explanations connected with facts or events known to us.
Vladimir Ilyich called Ivan Skvor-tsov-Stepanov, for instance, “the historian” (in view of his writings on history); at one time he carried on a lively correspondence with him through my sister and me.
* * Unfortunately only one letter from this correspondence has survived, the one dated December 16, 1909.

XIV, pp.
212-16.
(Two letters from the cor-respondence of Lenin and Skvortsov-Stepanov have survived—De-cember 2 and 16, 1909.

When he sent greetings to V.
V.
Vorovsky, who was in exile in Vologda at the same time as I, Vladimir Ilyich wrote “Greetings to Polish friends, and I hope they help you in every way.
” * By “China traveller” he meant A.
P.
Sklya-renko, who was employed on the railway in Manchuria at the time, and “the gentleman we went boating with last year”** was V.
A.
Levitsky, etc.
The despatch of underground publications, secret cor-respondence, books containing letters in invisible ink, etc.
, had to be referred to in Aesopian language, etc.
At the end of December 1900 I gave G.
B.
Krasin, who was going abroad, the Manifesto of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries to take to Vladimir Ilyich; for purposes of secrecy I concealed it in an album of photographs.
Vla-dimir Ilyich was very pleased with this package and wrote in a letter dated January 16, 1901, “many thanks to Manyasha for the books she sent, and especially for the un-usually beautiful and interesting photographs from our cousin in Vienna; I should like to receive such gifts more often”.
*** Iskra and other underground publications were sent to Russia in envelopes to “ clean”, legal addresses.
We also used these addresses to obtain literature for ourselves.
Information concerning such packages was sometimes con-tained in legal letters to enable us to make enquiries of the addressee in good time.
Information of this kind seems to be contained in Vladimir Ilyich’s statement (letter of December 14, 1900), “I remember that I sent you the things that interested you on the ninth.
” And in her letter of Feb-ruary 8, 1916, Nadezhda Konstantinovna wrote, “Volodya was very pleased with your big letter.
Perhaps you will write again.
” **** Since our legal letters were never exceptionally long and during the imperialist war, when this letter was written, we corresponded mainly by postcard, even regis-tered postcards, and since many letters were lost in transit, the words quoted apparently refer to an illegal letter con-cealed in a book.

When Vladimir Ilyich was first living abroad in 1900 and still did not know whether his stay would be more or less permanent, he did not give us his private address; when he was living in Switzerland or in Munich we wrote to him in Paris or Prague for reasons of secrecy.
In his let-ter of March 2, 1901, for instance, he sent us his new add-ress, adding “I have moved together with my landlord”.
* Franz Modrá0ek, to whose address we sent our letters, actually did move at that time to a new apartment, but Vladimir Ilyich remained in Munich in the old one.
Characteristic of Vladimir Ilyich were his great punctual-ity and thoroughness and his strict economy in spending money, especially on himself.
Vladimir Ilyich probably inherited these qualities from our mother, whom he resembled in many ways.
Our mother was of German descent on her mother’s side and these qualities were deeply ingrained in her character.
Vladimir Ilyich’s carefulness with money and his frugal-ity in spending it on himself can be seen from his letter of October 5, 1895.
** “I am now, for the first time in St.
Petersburg, keeping a cash-book to see how much I actually spend.
It turned out that for the month August 28 to September 27 I spent altogether 54 rubles 30 kopeks, not including payment for things (about 10 rubles) and expenses for a court case (also about 10 rubles) which I shall probably conduct.
It is true that part of this 54 rubles was spent on things that do not have to be bought every month (galoshes, clothes, books, an abacus, etc.
), but even discounting that (16 rubles), the expenditure is still excessive—38 rubles in a month.
Obviously I have not been living carefully; in one month I have spent a ruble and 36 kopeks on the horse trams, for instance.
When I get used to the place I shall probably spend less.
” He really did live economically, especially when he was not earning anything and had recourse to “philanthropy”, * Letter No.
125.
—Ed.
** The letter referred to is that of October 5, 1893 (Letter No.
1), —Ed.
as he called his mother’s financial aid.
He economised to such an extent that he did not even subscribe to Russkiye Vedomosti * for himself when he was living in St.
Peters-burg in 1893, but read the paper in the Public Library when it was “two weeks old”.
“ When I get a job here perhaps I will subscribe to it,” he wrote to me.
** Vladimir Ilyich retained this trait all his life and it made itself felt, not only in Russia when he was not earning anything and when he was abroad and could not find a publisher for his literary works (one has only to recall that The Agrarian Question was lying about for ten whole years and saw the light of day only in 1917) and was thus in a critical position (see, for instance, his letter to Comrade Shlyapnikov of September 1916 *** ), but also when he was materially well provided for, i.
e.
, after the 1917 Revolution.
There was one thing, however, that Vladimir Ilyich found it difficult to economise on—books.
He needed them for his work, so that he could keep himself up-to-date on for-eign and Russian politics, economics, etc.
“To my great horror,” he wrote in a letter to his mother, sent from Berlin August 29, 1895, “I see that I am again in financial ‘difficulties’; the ‘temptation’ to buy books, etc.
, is so great that the devil alone knows where the money goes.
”**** Even in this, however, he tried to cut down, main-ly by going to work in libraries, especially as they provided him with a quieter working atmosphere when he was abroad—there was none of the hubbub and endless, wearisome talk that was so typical of the exiles, who were bored by surroundings unusual and alien to them, and who liked to unburden themselves in conversation.
Vladimir Ilyich used libraries not only when he was living abroad but also in Russia.
In a letter to his mother from St.
Petersburg he wrote that he was satisfied with his new room, which was “not far from the centre (only some 15 minutes’ walk from the library)”.
***** Passing through * At that time Russkiye Vedomosti was the most decent and interesting of all bourgeois papers.

Moscow on his way to his place of exile he even made use of the few days he was in the city to work in the library of the Rumyantsev Museum.
When he was living in Kras-noyarsk and had to await the start of the navigation season to continue his way to Minusinsk Uyezd, he worked in Yudin’s library, and had to walk about 5 versts every day to do so.
During the period of banishment, when there was no possibility of using a library, Vladimir Ilyich tried to make up for this by asking us to arrange for library books to be sent him by post.
A few experiments of this sort were made but too much time was wasted (about a month there and back) and library books were issued for a restricted period.
Vladimir Ilyich resorted to this method at a later date, too.
In a letter to his sister Anna dated February 11, 1914, * he wrote: “With regard to the summaries of crime statis-tics for 1905-1908, I would ask you not to buy them (there is no need, they are expensive) but to get them from a libra-ry (either the Bar Council or the Duma Library) and send them for a month.
” When he was living abroad Vladimir Ilyich also made constant use of libraries.
In Berlin he worked in the Impe-rial Library.
In Geneva there was his favourite “club” (Société de lecture), where he had to become a member and pay cer-tain dues—very small ones, to be sure—in order to work in the “club’s ” library.
In Paris he worked in the Biblio-.
théque nationale, although he complained that it was “bad-ly organised”; in London he worked in the British Museum.
And only when he was living in Munich did he complain that “there is no library here”; in Krakow, too, he made but little use of the library.
In his letter to me of April 22, 1914 he wrote that “here (in Krakow.
—M.
U.
) the library is a bad one and extremely inconvenient, although I scarce-ly ever have to go there.
.
.
.
” His work for the newspaper (Pravda), all sorts of dealings with comrades, who came to Krakow in greater numbers than to France or Switzerland, his guidance of the activities of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, Party conferences and meetings, etc.
, * The letter has been lost and the extract quoted here has been taken from the files of the Police Department (see Letter No.
247).
—Ed.
required so much effort that there was little time left for scientific studies.
Even then, however, Vladimir Ilyich “often thought of Geneva, where work went better, the libra-ry was convenient, and life was less nerve-racking and time-wasting”.
* After his arrest in Galicia at the beginning of the imperial-ist war Vladimir Ilyich again went to Switzerland; from there he wrote “the libraries here are good, and I have made quite decent arrangements as far as the use of books is con-cerned.
It is even pleasant to read after my daily news-paper work”.
** Later he went with his wife from Berne to Zurich in order, among other things, “to work in the libraries here” (continuing, however, the same intensive Party political work, as his correspondence in that period with Comrades Karpinsky and Ravich, just published in Lenin Miscellany XI, clearly illustrates *** ) which, according to him, were “ much better than those in Berne”.
But although Vladimir Ilyich was better off abroad as regards the reading of foreign books, journals and newspapers— he visited libraries for this purpose—the shortage of Rus-sian books made itself sharply felt.
“I can easily get German books here, there is no shortage of them.
But there is a shortage of Russian books,” he wrote in a letter dated April 2, 1902.
**** “I see very few new books”, he wrote on April 6, 1900.
There is no doubt that Vladimir Ilyich’s work was greatly hampered by his frequently not having the necessary book to hand when he lived abroad.
This is why his letters to his relatives frequently contained requests for certain books that he needed for his work (statistics, books on the agrarian question, on philosophy, etc.
) and also new publications, journals and fiction.
And again, it is possible to judge, to some extent, what branches of knowledge he was interested in and needed literature about at any given time, and for which writings he used them.
Among this literature considerable attention was paid to various statistical returns.

From his works, and from the rough copies, notes and calculations that preceded those works we see clearly what great importance Vladimir Ilyich attached to statistics, to “precise facts, indisputable facts”.
* His unfinished and as yet unpublished article “Statistics and Sociology” by P.
Piryuchev (a new pen-name that Vladimir Ilyich adopted to facilitate the publication of this work) is typical in this respect; it is devoted to the question of “the role and sig-nificance of national movements, the relationship between the national and the international”.
** The following passage is from this article: “The most widely used, and most fallacious, method in the realm of social phenomena is to tear out individual minor facts and juggle with examples.
Selecting chance examples presents no difficulty at all, but is of no value, or of purely negative value, for in each individual case everything hinges on the historically concrete situation.
Facts, if we take them in their totality, in their interconnection, are not only stub-born things, but undoubtedly proof-bearing things.
Minor facts, if taken out of their totality, out of their intercon-nection, if they are arbitrarily selected and torn out of context, are merely things for juggling with, or even worse.
.
.
.
We must seek to build a reliable foundation of precise and indisputable facts that can be set against any of the ‘general’ or ‘example-based’ arguments now so grossly misused in certain countries.
And if it is to be a real foundation, we must take not individual facts, but the sum total of facts, without a single exception, relating to the question under discussion.
Otherwise there will be the inevitable, and fully justified, suspicion that the facts were selected or compiled arbitrarily, that instead of historical phenomena being presented in objective interconnection and inter-dependence and treated as a whole, we are presenting a ‘subjective’ concoction to justify what might prove to be a dirty business.
This does happen .
.
.
and more often than one might think.

**** These statistics which Vladimir Ilyich used for his book Thefrom among the books he had had with him in Siberia, to be sent to him abroad, for, as he said in a letter dated April 2, 1902, “I am beginning to miss these things”.
Later, in order to get statistical material from various towns and to get it more regularly, Vladimir Ilyich wrote a special appeal * to statisticians participating in the Congress of Doc-tors and Naturalists (there was a sub-section for statisticians at this congress) held in Moscow in the winter of 1909.
A number of provincial statisticians responded and in a letter dated January 2, 1910, Vladimir Ilyich wrote, “I have also received a letter about statistics from Ryazan—it is splendid that I shall probably be getting help from many people.
” ** In 1908, when Vladimir Ilyich was working on his Mate-rialism and Empirio-criticism, he ordered a book by Pro-fessor Chelpanov about Avenarius and his school, the book Immanent Philosophy and others.
He wrote to me about this work of his, “I have been doing a lot of work on the Machists and I think I have sorted out all their inexpres-sible vulgarities (and those of ‘empirio-monism’ as well).
”*** When Vladimir Ilyich inquired whether his manuscript about the latest form of capitalism (Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism) **** had been received he wrote, “I regard this work on economics as being of exceptionally great importance and would especially like to see it in print in full” (letter of October 22, 1916).
***** As we know, this wish was not fulfilled (although Vladimir Ilyich “did his utmost to adapt himself to the ‘restrictions’”, as he wrote in a letter to M.
N.
Pokrovsky on July 2, 1916); ****** Vladimir Ilyich’s work underwent a large number of changes and many Development of Capitalism in Russia, together with other books of his, were returned from abroad in 1929, and by the extracts he made and the marginal notes in the books it will be possible to draw a num-ber of valuable conclusions on the way he worked.

cuts were made, and only ten years later was it published in its original form.
From Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives we see in what connection he set about writing his (as yet unpub-lished) article “The Capitalist System of Modern Agricul-ture”.
* In a letter dated October 22, 1916, he wrote to me, “You write that the publisher wants to put out The Agrari-an Question as a book and not as a pamphlet.
I under-stand that to mean that I must send him the continuation (i.
e.
, in addition to what I have written about America I must write what I have promised about Germany).
I will start on this as soon as I have finished what I have to write to cover the advance received from the old publisher.
” ** The manuscript of this work, which is now in the possession of the Institute, is unfinished; apparently the revolution “hindered” Vladimir Ilyich and he could not finish it.
The letters here presented to the reader give something of a picture of the conditions under which Vladimir Ilyich carried on his literary work, and also of those trials he had to undergo to publish the results of that work.
I am refer-ring here to what he published legally.
Vladimir Ilyich worked in unfavourable conditions throughout the entire pre-revolutionary period (with the exception of the period of the first revolution and the Zvezda and Pravda period— 1912-14—when he was able to contribute to the legal press and when we had, for a short time, at least, our own legal publishers); this was while he was abroad and experienced, for instance, a great shortage of Russian books and other material needed for his work.
Censorship conditions also created considerable difficulty; Vladimir Ilyich’s articles were cut and distorted (like his article “Uncritical Criticism”, for instance) or were con-fiscated (The Agrarian Question, Vol.
II), and so on and so forth.
Great difficulties were also caused by lack of contact with Russia, because of which it was frequently impossible to establish direct communications with publishers, etc.
Typical of the situation are his frequent attempts to obtain work for Granat’s Encyclopaedic Dictionary.
“ I would like * Collected Works, Vol.
16, pp.
423-46.
—Ed.
** Letter No.
260.
—Ed.
to get some work for the Encyclopaedic Dictionary,” he wrote to me in his letter of December 22, 1914, “but it is probably not easy to arrange unless you have an oppor-tunity to meet the secretary of the editorial board.
” * Vla-dimir Ilyich had no such opportunity, and when he applied directly to the Granat office he either received no answer at all, or received one only after a considerable delay.
“Is it possible to obtain some more work for the Encyclopaedic Dictionary?” he wrote to me in 1915.
“I have written to the secretary about this but he has not answered me.
” ** “In this place, unfortunately, I am cut off from all contact with publishers,” he wrote in 1912.
*** If it had not been for the great help from comrades and relatives in seeking publishers, reading the proofs of his works, etc.
, there would have been even greater difficulties in getting his writings published.
But we, his sisters and brother, were not always in a position to help him in these matters, especially when we were in prison or in exile.
In 1904, for instance, he asked mother to give him the address of Anna’s husband, Mark Timofeyevich, for whom he had some “literary business” (letter of January 20, 1904).
**** Vladimir Ilyich, however, not only had the ability to work systematically, persistently and fruitfully, he also had the ability to rest—when the opportunity offered.
For him the best form of rest was out in the open, close to nature and away from people.
“Here (in Stjernsund in Finland, where he was resting after returning “terribly tired” from the Fifth Party Congress.
—M.
U.
) you can have a wonderful rest, swimming, walking, no people and no work.
No people and no work—that is the best thing for me.
” ***** He enjoyed a really excellent rest there, where Lidiya Mikhailovna Knipovich surrounded him with * Letter No.

exceptional care and attention, and he recalled it in a letter to me when I had just got over a bad attack of enteric fev-er.
“Now would be the time to send you to Stjernsund,” he wrote.
* Vladimir Ilyich was extremely fond of nature and in his letters one constantly comes across references to the beauties of nature, no matter where he happens to be.
“The scenery here is splendid, I am enjoying it all the time.
The Alps began immediately after the little German station I wrote to you from; then came the lakes and I could not tear myself away from the window of the railway carriage,” he wrote to mother when he was on his way to Switzerland in 1895.
And again he wrote to mother, “I take walks— walking is not at all bad here at present and, it seems, there are plenty of nice places in Pskov (and also in its environs).
” From abroad he wrote, “I saw Anyuta a few days ago, took a trip on a very beautiful lake with her and enjoyed the wonderful views and the good weather.
” “A few days ago I had a wonderful outing to Salève with Nadya and a friend.
Down below in Geneva it was all mist and gloom, but up on the mountain (about 4,000 feet above sea level) there was glorious sunshine, snow, tobogganing— altogether a good Russian winter’s day.
And at the foot of the mountain—la mer du brouillard, a veritable sea of mist and clouds, concealing everything except the moun-tains jutting up through it, and only the highest at that.
Even little Salève (nearly 3,000 feet) was wrapped in mist.
” “Na-dya and I have travelled and walked round a great deal of the surrounding country and have found some very nice places,” we read in a letter dated September 27, 1902.
Vla-dimir Ilyich was probably right when he wrote, “We are the only people among the comrades here who are explor-ing every bit of the surrounding country.
We discover various ‘rural’ paths, we know all the places nearby and intend to go further afield.
”** If they were unable to get out of town for the summer and drop straight into “rural life” (“we get up early and go to bed almost with the roosters”), *** Vladimir Ilyich * Letter No.

and Nadezhda Konstantinovna, when they were living in Switzerland, sometimes went walking in the mountains.
There is a description of one such journey in a letter Nadezh-da Konstantinovna wrote to my mother on July 2, 1904.
“It is already a week since we got away from Geneva and are now resting in the full sense of the word.
We have left our work and our worries in Geneva and here we sleep ten hours a day, and go swimming and walking—Volodya does not even read the newspapers properly; we took a minimum of books with us, and even those we are sending back to Ge-neva tomorrow, unread, while we ourselves shall don our rucksacks at four in the morning and set out for a two weeks’ walking tour in the mountains.
We shall go to Interlaken and from there to Lucerne.
We are reading Baedeker and planning our journey carefully.
.
.
.
Volodya and I have made an agreement not to talk about our work—work, he says, is not a bear and will not escape to the woods—not even to men-tion it, and, as far as possible, not to think about it.
”* Such journeys, however, were rare and were undertaken only when work and the factional squabbling had had too bad an effect on health and on nerves, as was the case in the winter of 1903-04 after the Second Party Congress and the split.
As a rule, if Vladimir Ilyich went to the country for the summer, he continued his work there, whenever it was possible, after a few days’ complete rest.
If it was impossible to get out of town, or if such trips were too short, they made excursions to the country, sometimes to the mountains, on foot or on their bicycles, usually on Sundays.
“Quite unintentionally we are taking to foreign ways and arrange our outings on Sundays of all days, though that is the worst time because everywhere is crowded,” Lenin wrote in a letter to his mother (March 29, 1903).
** On such outings they usually took sandwiches with them instead of having lunch and set off for the whole day.
No wonder Vladimir Ilyich and Nadezhda Konstantinovna belonged to the “excursionist” party while other comrades formed the “cinemist” party (those who liked the cinema), as they jokingly called themselves.

Vladimir Ilyich was, indeed, not very fond of the differ-ent amusements in which other comrades found relaxation after hard work.
I do not think he ever went to the cinema, especially when he was living abroad, and he visited theatres only on rare occasions.
He went to see The Weavers when he was in Berlin on his first trip abroad, and he went to the theatre when he was living abroad in exile, mostly, however, when he was living there “somewhat alone” (i.
e.
, without his family), or when he happened to be in a big city on business after a period of intensive work and he took advantage of the trip to “snap out of himself”.
The theatres abroad gave Vladimir Ilyich little satisfaction (at times he and Nadezhda Konstantinovna left the theatre after the first act, on which occasions their comrades jokingly accused them of wasting money), and of the plays he saw in the later period, only The Living Corpse created an impres-sion on him.
He liked the Moscow Art Theatre very much, however; he had been there with Lalayants (“Columbus”) before he went abroad, when he was staying in Moscow, and in a letter to his mother in February 1901 he said that “he still remembers with pleasure” that visit to the theatre.
But what we would like would be to visit the Russian Art Theatre and see The Lower Depths,” * we read in his letter of February 4, 1903.
He did not manage to see The Lower Depths until many years later, when he was living in Moscow after the revolution.
His visits to concerts were also relatively rare, although he loved music.
“We recently went to our first concert this winter”, we read in the same letter, “and were very pleased with it—especially Chaikovsky’s latest symphony (Sym-phonie pathétique).
” “I was at the opera a few days ago and heard La Juive with the greatest pleasure; I had heard it once in Kazan (when Zakrzhevsky sang)—that must be thirteen years ago, and some of the tunes have remained in my memory,” he wrote to mother on February 9, 1901.
** After-wards he often whistled those tunes (he had his own pecu-liar way of whistling through his teeth).
Later, during his life abroad, Vladimir Ilyich rarely visited concerts or ope-* Letter No.

ras.
Music had too powerful an effect on his nerves, and when they were upset, as was often the case in the turmoil of life among the émigrés abroad, it affected him badly.
Vladimir Ilyich was always very busy and his budget was a modest one and this had its effect on his secluded (as far as amusements were concerned) way of life.
Vladimir Ilyich paid relatively little attention to the various sights: “I have little taste for such things in general and in most cases have seen them only by accident.
In general, I much prefer wandering around and seeing the evening amusements and pastimes of the people to visiting museums, theatres, shopping centres, etc.
” * Vladimir Ilyich usually did his “wandering around” in the evenings when he was living in Berlin in 1895, and this enabled him to study “the Berlin mores and listen to German speech”.
** It was not, however, only when he was in Berlin on his first trip abroad that he made a study of customs; there are quite a number of passages in his letters to his relatives which show that when he was living in Paris, or was there on a short trip, he found pleasure in examining the local way of life and he remarked the free and easy manner of the public in the streets and on the boulevards.
“Paris is a very inconvenient town for a man of modest means to live in, and very tiring,” he wrote after spending a few days in that city.
“But there is no better and more lively town to stay in for a short time, just for a visit, for an outing.
” *** Vladimir Ilyich also studied Czech life when he was passing through Czechoslovakia and was sorry that he had not learned the Czech language; he gave a lively description of the manners and customs of the Galician peasants that he had an opportunity of observing when he was living in Galicia, and of the carnival in the Munich streets with its battles of con-fetti and streamers, etc.
He loved life in all its forms and had a rare talent for observing and studying it on a broad scale.
The letters published here give a picture of Vladimir Ilyich’s attitude towards his relatives and, to some extent, his feelings for people in general.
How much care and * Letter No.
10.
—Ed.
** Ibid.
*** Letter No.

—Ed.
attention is displayed in those letters! Vladimir Ilyich was greatly attached to his relatives, especially to mother, and in all his letters, in those addressed to other members of our family as well as to mother, there is always a note of solicitude for her, the wish that things should go better for her and that she should have a more peaceful and comfortable life.
His letters are full of questions about health, whether good arrangements have been made for an apartment, whether it is not cold.
“I am worried that your apartment is so cold; what will it be like in winter if the temperature is only 12° now? You must not catch cold.
.
.
.
Is there nothing you can do? Perhaps you should put in a small stove,” he wrote in a letter to his mother in 1909.
* These letters contain a great deal of advice to “have a good rest in sum-mer”, “run about less, rest more and keep well”, etc.
Vladimir Ilyich was particularly attentive to his mother at those times when some misfortune overtook her, and misfortunes were many in her life.
First one, then another member of our family was arrested and exiled, sometimes several of us were arrested at the same time and she, though advanced in years, had to go again and again to prisons to visit her family and take things to them, to sit for hours in the waiting-rooms of the gendarmerie and the secret police, and was often left completely alone with her heart aching for her children who had been deprived of their liberty.
How worried Vladimir Ilyich was at such times, and how heavily the lack of personal contact with his moth-er weighed upon him, can be seen from his letter of Sep-tember 1, 1901.
At that time my brother-in-law, Mark Yeli-zarov, and I were in prison, my sister Anna was abroad and could not return to Russia because she would have been arrested on the same charge, and our brother Dmitry could not remain with mother because he had to graduate from the University of Yuriev.
She was left alone in the same way in a strange town in 1904 when my sister, my brother Dmitry and I were arrested on charges connected with the Kiev Party Committee and the Central Committee.
Vladimir Ilyich always wanted mother to live with him, and he frequently invited her to do so.
This was difficult * Letter No.
198.
—Ed.
to arrange, however, because mother was always with those of her children who were particularly in need of her help, and in Russia that help was needed almost always by those who had fallen into the hands of the police.
And so it turned out that each time Vladimir Ilyich was living in exile abroad, both the first and the second time, she was able to stay abroad only for a very short while to see him.
In 1902, she lived for about a month with Vladimir Ilyich and our sister Anna at Loguivy in the north of France.
The second time, and this was the last time she was to see her son, was in Stockholm, where she and I went in 1910 specially to visit him.
Vladimir Ilyich always provided her with detailed itineraries for such trips and advised her to stop the night in hotels in order not to overtire herself with the jour-ney.
It was also in Stockholm that mother for the first and last time heard Vladimir Ilyich speak in public; it was at a meeting of worker exiles.
When we left, Vladimir Ilyich accompanied us to the boat—he could not go aboard the vessel because it belonged to a Russian company and he might have been arrested on it—and I still remember the expression on his face as he stood there looking at moth-er.
How much pain there was in his face! He seemed to feel that this was the last time he would see her.
And so it was.
Vladimir Ilyich did not see any of his relatives again until he came to Russia after the February Revolution, and mother died shortly before it, in July 1916.
We did not receive the first letter Vladimir Ilyich wrote when he had news of mother’s death.
The next letter has not survived either, but from what I remember of it it showed what a heavy loss it was to him, how much pain it caused him, and how tender he was to all of us, who were also distressed by our loss.
Vladimir Ilyich also devoted considerable attention to us, his sisters and brother, and to Mark Yelizarov; he was always interested to know how we were getting on, whether we were earning anything, whether we had had good holi-days, etc.
He tried to get books for us to translate and sometimes sent foreign books to us for that purpose, showed an interest in what we read and studied, invited us to stay with him, and so on.
Vladimir Ilyich also displayed a great interest in his comrades, inquired how they were gettingon and tried to help them materially as well.
He undertook to write prefaces for his comrades’ translations, so as to make it easier for them to get the books published and thus have an opportunity of earning something.
Comrades who are unacquainted with life in exile abroad and with the way legal correspondence was carried on under tsarism may think it strange that Vladimir Ilyich fre-quently says in his letters that he is “living very quietly”, “ peacefully”, “modestly” and so on in periods such as that of the imperialist war, for instance, when it is obvious from literature and from his underground correspondence that he was displaying tremendous energy in the struggle against the chauvinism that was influencing most of the Social-Democratic parties.
It must not be forgotten that at that time Vladimir Ilyich could only make his voice heard in the press, and then only in a publication that appeared once in several weeks or even, in several months, and which (like pamphlets) it was difficult to send from place to place; he could also speak at small meetings of exiles abroad or at small study circles for foreign workers.
It stands to reason that such opportunities were far too little for Vladimir Ilyich; Nadezhda Krupskaya said that at the beginning of the revolution in Russia he created the impression of a lion trying to break out of its cage—was not his former life in exile abroad and out of contact with Russia, and especially during the imperialist war, a cage that greatly restricted him, that did not permit him to branch out and could not satisfy him, the natural leader, the voice of the people? He was eager for work on a broader scale, his was truly the eagerness of the caged lion, and he had to work hard at persuading two or three comrades to obtain access to broader masses.
And for a nature like his was not “sleepy Borne” really too “quiet” and movement there too “gradu-al”?.
.
.
In his legal correspondence there are only occasional glimpses of his fury against “disgusting opportunists of the most dangerous type” and against “extreme vulgarities about voting for credits”, etc.
Here he was hampered by the censor and one has only to see which phrases from his letters (see Appendix, pp.
553-54) “attracted the attention” of the gendarmes and secret police and which became “materialevidence”, to understand that both he and his relatives were at that time in a situation in which it was very dif-ficult “to carry on the correspondence one would like”.
* We had good reason to make the proviso at the beginning of this preface that Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives are of significance and interest mainly because they provide a picture of him as a man (of course that picture is far from complete and, owing to conditions of police surveillance, somewhat one-sided).
In this respect, it seems to me, they constitute a valuable contribution to the literature on Vladimir Ilyich, and one can only regret that so many let-ters to relatives and to comrades have been lost.
There are other documents, especially his rich literary legacy, which speak of Lenin as the leader, the politician, the scholar.
Vladimir Ilyich’s second period of exile abroad was par-ticularly burdensome to him.
When he arrived in Geneva after having lived in and near St.
Petersburg, it was especially painful to return to the old ash-heap.
“We have been hang-ing about this damned Geneva for several days now,” he said in a letter to me on January 14, 1908.
“It is an awful hole, but there is nothing we can do.
We shall get used to it.
” ** With his customary persistence and energy he got down to work, because he could “get used to” any condi-tions.
“The only unpleasant thing was the actual moving, which was a change for the worse.
That, however, was inev-itable,” he wrote in the next letter to mother.
*** And this change from better to worse, this absence of the literature he needed for his work and of new books and newspapers made itself particularly felt at this time because in St.
Petersburg he had been able to road all the newspapers and journals and keep up-to-date on books.
And he asked us to obtain for him “ the minutes of the Third Duma (the officially published verbatim reports and also the announce-ments, questions and bills brought before the Duma)”, and to “send them all, missing nothing”.
He was also inter-ested in the “programmes, announcements and leaflets of the * Letter No.

Octobrists, the Rights, the Cossack group, etc.
” He was deprived of these necessary documents, whereas in the Duma “all these ‘bits of paper’ probably lie about on the floor and nobody picks them up”.
He also asked us to send him “every-thing new that the Mensheviks publish”, * trade union journals that had survived the debacle, etc.
During his life in exile abroad Vladimir Ilyich felt the shortage, not only of books (although we tried to provide him with at least the most interesting books that appeared on the market), but also of Russian newspapers.
Things were particularly bad in this respect during the imperialist war when at times Vladimir Ilyich had no Russian papers at all.
“Please send Russian newspapers once a week after you have read them, because I have none at all,” he wrote in a letter dated September 20, 1916.
** Vladimir Ilyich was also in dire need of an income, especially during his last years abroad.
“There will soon be an end to all our old sources of subsistence and the question of earning something is becoming acute,” wrote Nadezhda Krupskaya on December 14, 1915.
She said that Vladimir Ilyich was “seriously troubled” because he was very con-scientious where money was concerned or in accepting help from anybody, whoever it might be.
“I shall get down to writing something or other, because prices have risen so hellishly that life has become devilishly difficult,” he wrote on September 20, 1916.
*** Just a few months before the February Revolution, in the autumn of 1916, Vladimir Ilyich had to look for books to translate and to correspond with publishers about get-ting them published.
How unproductive a use for his labour it would have been if he had been compelled to spend his time translating, but this, too, was eventually “hindered” by the revolution.
Such were the conditions under which he lived abroad shortly before the revolution: lack of contact with Russia and the masses of working people, whom he was always trying so hard to exercise a direct influence over, the dif-* Letters Nos.

ficult living conditions in exile abroad—although energy and persistence were never lacking—so it is no wonder that his “nerves were on edge” and his whole organism seriously undermined.
His reporting of Nadezhda Konstantinovna’s joke that he “must have been ‘pensioned off ’” * touches a bitter note in the letter of February 15, 1917.
After this letter in which the difficult conditions in which Vladimir Ilyich was forced to live in pre-revolutionary times could be seen behind the jokes, came the glad tidings by telegraph, “Arriving Monday 11 p.

inform Pravda ” .
** That was the end of his period of exile, and also the end of his correspondence with his relatives.

APROPOS OF LENIN’S LETTERS TO RELATIVES* A man’s private correspondence is important in the compilation of his biography and in revealing him as an individual because it shows him in his day-to-day life, shows his relations with people and thus throws light on certain aspects of his character that are shown insufficient-ly or not at all by his scientific or public activities; in any case private correspondence adds new lines to the depiction of his character.
Although Vladimir Ilyich’s letters are, as a rule, very brief, condensed, and devoid of any effusiveness, which he never liked, any more than he liked other forms of verbosity; although behind the letters one feels the man of action accustomed to grudge the time he devotes to anything personal, they nevertheless reflect in some degree the character of the writer.
It should not be forgotten that the correspondence was carried on under conditions of tsarist censorship, when one had always to be prepared for the letters to be read by the police, with the result that they had to be particularly brief and condensed.
“It is very difficult .
.
.
to carry on the correspondence one would like,” ** Vladimir Ilyich wrote to Maria.
Letters in invisible ink allowed of greater free-dom; in these, in addition to purely business matters, one came across accounts of the latest Party news, of congresses and conferences, and precise characterisations—in two or three words—of people, parties and trends given by Vladimir * This article was written by Lenin’s sister Anna Ilyinichna Ulyanova-Yelizarova for the collection of Letters to Relatives pub-lished in 1931 and 1934.

Ilyich, the sharp, decisive expressions he used in ordinary, free conversation.
Such letters, however, had to be destroyed immediately they had been read, so, of course, not a single one of them has been preserved.
They were written between the lines of other letters or, more frequently between the lines of a book or journal or some reprint or other.
And when Vladimir Ilyich acknowledged the receipt of books and wrote that some diary of the Congress of Technicians or reprint from the archives was “very interesting and thank Anyuta very much for it” * that meant, of course, that the secret letter had been received.
Nor did I keep let-ters that were written in ordinary ink but were not sent to my own address; among such were, for instance, the letters I received in 1913-14 at the office of the journal Prosvesh-cheniye under an agreed-upon pseudonym.
And it was not always convenient to keep letters sent to my private address—I recall a couple that Vladimir Ilyich himself asked me to destroy.
As far as concerns the letters in this collection, it must be said that although they were written to people close to the writer and consequently contain much that has to do with the family alone and has little general interest, the addressees were people close to Vladimir Ilyich not only by blood but also in their convictions; he was also writing to them on business, so that the legal letters were often supplementary to the others and, therefore, formed a link in the whole chain of correspondence.
Vladimir Ilyich, of course, did not write to mother on business matters, but at the same time he had nothing to hide from her, knowing that she was fully in sympathy with his revolutionary efforts and all his work.
The result was that a letter addressed to one member of the family was, more often than not, intended for all.
Requests to us, his sisters, brother and brother-in-law, were often contained in letters to our mother; as a rule they were read by all members of the family and were often forwarded to those living in other towns.
The significance of Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his rela-tives naturally becomes all the greater for their having been written in the quarter of a century in which our Party, the * Letter No.

—Ed.
party that Vladimir Ilyich did so much to build, emerged and took shape.
The most intensive and substantial correspondence belongs to the 1897-99 and 1908-09 periods, in which two big books by Vladimir Ilyich—The Development of Capital-ism in Russia and Materialism and Empirio-criticism—were published, because these letters contained business requests connected with the two publications, with the reading of the proofs, etc.
Quite apart from this, the letters of the first of these two periods are fuller and more frequent since they were written when Vladimir Ilyich was in exile in Siberia, a condition that makes even the most restrained people turn to letter-writing because of the involuntary seclusion and the lack of contact with the life of the outside world.
The letters written by Vladimir Ilyich in this period, especially the more detailed ones addressed to mother, give us an excellent picture of the conditions under which he lived, his inclinations and habits—in these letters he stands out, if one may put it so, in clearest relief as a person.
Furthermore—and this is most important—in his letters from exile Vladimir Ilyich showed that he was not cut off from life, for in them he touched upon questions of Marx-ist theory and practice that were the most vital questions of the day.
We see from the letters—although it occurs in a veiled form, the only possible form—his attitude to mem-bers of the Emancipation of Labour group, to Plekhanov and Axelrod, his complete agreement with them and his profound respect for them, his contact with them both through letters and through the talks I conducted with them on his instructions during my trip abroad in 1897.
In these letters Vladimir Ilyich stated emphatically that “the iso-lation from political life” of which Axelrod had given warn-ing must not on any account be permitted.
“I believe the author to be wholly and a thousand times right, especially against narrow adherents of ‘economics’”, * meaning Mas-lov and Co.
, the editors of the newspaper Samarsky Vestnik, who had accused the journal Novoye Slovo, headed by Struve, of liberalism and sympathy for the bourgeoisie.
At that time Vladimir Ilyich considered it a matter of * Collected Works, Vol.

current importance not to confine propaganda and agitation to the economic struggle alone.
“It is important that the illusion should not be allowed to develop that anything can be achieved by the struggle against the factory-owners alone,” he said to me shortly before his arrest.
“From the very outset the political consciousness of the workers must be aroused.
” It was for this reason that Vladimir Ilyich, in complete agreement with the Emancipation of Labour group, took the side of Struve in his differences with the Samarsky Vestnik writers, as Fedoseyev and Martov also did, and wrote to Maslov and Co.
in Struve’s defence.
One of the letters from Vladimir Ilyich (according to Maslov) was written in a militant tone and concluded with the words: “If you want war, let it be war”.
In 1899, Vladimir Ilyich on several occasions spoke against the Samarans in his letters.
“As far as the Samarans are concerned, I doubt very much whether they have said anything sensible (I have already had a letter about the accusation of ‘bourgeois sympathies’).
”—letter of February 13, 1899.
* Concerning the review of Gvozdyov’s book he wrote: “I did not enjoy writing the review.
I did not like the book—nothing new, generalities, an impossible style in places.
.
.
.
” “It would be very useful and very interesting to talk on this subject (on the article about the heritage.

) to people who do not limit themselves to Gvozdyov’s theories (have you read his book about kulaks? ** I think it is very, very weak).
” *** Vladimir Ilyich continued his struggle against “econom-ism” in agreement with Axelrod and Plekhanov, who in 1895, at the time of Vladimir Ilyich’s first trip abroad, insisted on the need to get away from the disputes between study circles and the Narodniks, to break down the isola-tion and go over to the organisation of a political party of Social-Democrats; he noted, however, another extreme in Axelrod’s new pamphlet (on the relationship between * Letter No.

liberal and socialist democracy in Russia).
Vladimir Ilyich showed that the author did not stress the class character of the movement sufficiently, that he was too kindly towards the Frondist agrarians and should have spoken of using them but not of supporting them.
In these letters we find some expression of Vladimir Ilyich’s indignation at the revisionist trend then emerg-ing—Bernstein’s book, articles by German revisionists in Neue Zeit and Bulgakov’s article.
In respect of the last-named he wrote, “Bulgakov simply made me mad; such nonsense, such utter nonsense, and such eternal professorial pretentiousness—what the devil is this?! .
.
.
” “Kautsky he distorts outright.
.
.
.
I am thinking of writing ‘about Kaut-sky’s book’” (against Bernstein.
—A.
Y.
)—see letter of May 1, 1899.
* About Bernstein he wrote the following: “Nadya and I started reading Bernstein’s book immediately; we have read more than a half and its contents astonish us more and more as we go on.
It is unbelievably weak theoretically— mere repetition of someone else’s ideas.
There are phrases about criticism but no attempt at serious independent crit-icism.

I shall soon be writing to Anyuta on this subject in detail.
” ** Ilyich asked his sister Maria to get him reports of the Han-over Party Congress (letter of August 22, 1899) that was to be held in October.
The chief issue at the Hanover Con-gress, of course, was that of Bernstein.
When Vladimir Ilyich sent his review of Bulgakov’s article *** to Novoye Slovo (it was published in Nauchnoye Obozreniye) he wrote, “Of course, polemics among one’s own people are unpleas-* Letters Nos.

ant and I tried to tone the article down, but to keep quiet about differences is not only unpleasant, it is downright harmful—and, furthermore, one cannot keep quiet about the chief differences between ‘orthodoxy’ and ‘criticism’ that have come to the fore in German and Russian Marx-ism”.
* Tugan-Baranovsky also made Vladimir Ilyich indignant (letter of June 20, 1899).
“I have seen Nauchnoye Obozre-niye No.
5, and find that Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in it is monstrously foolish and nonsensical; he has simply arbitrarily introduced changes into the rate of surplus value in order to ‘refute’ Marx; he assumes an absurdity—a change in the productivity of labour without a change in the value of the product.
I do not know whether every such nonsensical article is worth writing about.
Let him first fulfil his promise to develop it in detail.
In general, I am becoming a more and more determined opponent of the lat-est ‘critical stream’ in Marxism and of neo-Kantianism (which has produced, incidentally, the idea of separating sociological from economic laws).
The author of Beiträge zur Geschichte des Materialismus** is quite right in declar-ing that neo-Kantianism is a reactionary theory of the reac-tionary bourgeoisie and in rebelling against Bernstein.
” *** Vladimir Ilyich’s second article— “ Once More on the Theory of Realisation” **** —was directed mainly against Struve, whose sympathy for revisionism was becoming more and more obvious.
It is true that at this time Vladimir Ilyich’s criticism was still of a friendly nature since he was criticising one of his own side.
“I am now finishing an article in reply to Struve.
It seems to me he has got things badly mixed up and his article may cause a good deal of misunderstanding among supporters and malicious glee among opponents” (March 7).

He also wrote that he had begun studying philosophy from the few philosophical books in his possession.
“Volodya is busy reading all kinds of philosophy (that is now his official occupation)—Holbach, Helvétius, etc.
,” Nadezhda Krupskaya wrote in a letter to our mother on June 20, 1899.
* And lastly there was the document known as the Credo, probably the biggest political fact of the period, and the reply ** to it compiled by 17 Social-Democrats; this is also mentioned in the letters.
“I shall write to Anyuta soon about the Credo (which interests and exasperates me and everybody else) in detail.
”*** (August 1, 1899.
)**** “As far as the Credo der Jungen is concerned, I was amazed at the emptiness of the phrases.
It is not a Credo but a piti-ful collection of words I intend to write in greater detail about it.
” (August 25, 1899.
)***** I had sent this document to Vladimir Ilyich and quite by chance given it this name.
I had not regarded it as being of any particular significance and in a letter in invisible ink I had said as briefly as possible “I am sending you a Credo of the young.
” Later, when the name had come to be accepted and there was talk about an “Anti-Credo”, I was worried about hav-ing exaggerated the importance of the document with this incorrect name, and wrote to Vladimir Ilyich about it in invisible ink.
It seems this place in the letter remained unread because when he returned from exile I told him the document had not been the “symbol of faith” of any group of the young but came from the pen of two authors, Kus-kova and Prokopovich, and that I had given it the name of Credo myself; Vladimir Ilyich was surprised and asked: “You did?” But then, after a short silence, be said in any case it had been necessary to reply to it.
And that is how the document went the rounds under that name.
Thus we see that in his letters to his relatives sent from * Krupskaya’s Letter No.

his place of exile, Vladimir Ilyich reacted to all the most urgent questions of the Party life of that time; there are signs in these letters of the main course he was mapping out, the course that was to avoid the narrowness of econom-ism and also the threatening danger of diffusion that lay in offering favours to the liberals, and also the purely intel-lectualist attraction to revisionism and criticism for crit-icism’s sake.
While still in exile he was already selecting his comrades for the future Party organisation and for “undisguised literature”;* he wrote to Potresov about the need for this and naming for it, of all his comrades in exile, only Martov, “the only one who really took all this (the interests of a journal, of the Party) seriously to heart”.
He drew up a plan for Iskra.
In Vladimir Ilyich’s letters for the 1908-09 period— the time when his Materialism and Empirio-criticism was being published—there are also statements on general mat-ters, especially on the subject of his book, although such statements are fewer than in the letters sent from Siberia which were, in general, much more detailed.
The attempts to revise the philosophical aspect of Marxism (they were headed by Bogdanov and Lunacharsky in Russia) made Vladimir Ilyich no less indignant than Bernstein’s politi-co-economic revision.
We saw that when he was still in Siberia this neo-Kantian trend in Marxism aroused in him the desire to undertake the study of philosophy.
In the years of reaction following our first revolution the “god-seeker” trend made him take up philosophical studies seriously and write a book analysing this deviation from Marxism.
“My illness has held up my work on philosophy very badly,” he wrote to his sister Maria on July 13, 1908.
“I * L.
Kamenev’s interpretation of these words in the Preface to Lenin’s letters and in Note No.
41 (Lenin Miscellany IV, p.
19) is obviously incorrect.

am now almost well again and will most certainly write the book.
I have been doing a lot of work on the Machists and I think I have sorted out all their inexpressible vul-garities (and those of ‘empirio-monism’ as well).
”* Vladimir Ilyich was terribly indignant at “popov-shchina” ** , a word he used for all kinds of god-seeking and all other attempts at dragging religious views into Marxism in some form or another.
Because of the censorship he pro-posed changing the word “popovshchina” into “fideism”, with a footnote explaining it (fideism is a doctrine which substitutes faith for knowledge, or which generally attaches significance to faith).
*** That is how it appeared in the book.
In the manuscript, the phrase to which this footnote was added read as follows: “Supported by all these supposedly recent doctrines, our destroyers of dialectical materialism proceed fearlessly to downright popovshchina (clearest of all in the case of Lu-nacharsky, but by no means in his case alone!)”.
And Vla-dimir Ilyich came down very heavily on these “destroyers”; he asked me not to tone down anything concerning them and I had difficulty in getting him to agree to a certain toning down for the sake of the censorship.
“ ‘Mentally projected god’ will have to be changed to ‘mentally projected for himself—well, to use a mild expres-sion—religious conceptions’ or something of the sort”.
**** In the manuscript this phrase had the following wording: “People can think and mentally project for themselves any kind of hell, all sorts of devils.
Lunacharsky even mentally projected for himself a god.
” When there was no question of censorship he wrote to me: “Please do not tone down anything in the places against Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and Co.
They must not be toned down.
You have deleted the passage about Chernov being a ‘more honest’ opponent than they, which is a great pity.
The shade of meaning you have given is not the one I want.
There is now no overall consistency in my accusations.

of Marxism in philosophy.
” Further he said: “Please do not tone down the places against Bogdanov and Lunachar-sky’s popovshchina.
We have completely broken off relations with them.
There is no reason for toning them down, it is not worth the trouble.
” (March 9, 1909.
) “Especially—do not throw out Purishkevich,” he wrote on March 21, “and the others in the section on the criticism of Kantianism!”* Vladimir Ilyich compared the Machists to Purishkevich because the latter had once said that he criticised the Cadets more consistently and with greater determination than the Marxists did, and the Machists assured us that they criticised Kant more consistently and with greater deter-mination than the Marxists did.
But, Mr.
Purishkevich, Vladimir Ilyich said to him, “it must not be forgotten that you criticised the Constitutional-Democrats for being excessively democratic while we criticised them for being insufficiently democratic.
The Machists criticise Kant for being too much of a materialist, we criticise him for not being enough of a materialist.
The Machists criticise Kant from the right, we from the left.
” (Works, Vol.
XIII, p.
163.
)** When he later sent a supplement to Chapter Four, Sec-tion One, “From What Angle Did N.
G.
Chernyshevsky Criticise Kantianism?” Vladimir Ilyich wrote: “I regard it as extremely important to counterpose Chernyshevsky to the Machists.
” *** Vladimir Ilyich mentioned the political aspect of the differences known in those days as the differ-ences with the Vperyod group in only a couple of words in his legal letters.
“Things are bad here—Spaltung (split.

for which the extended editorial board declared it could bear no responsibility “in view of the fact that the initiat-ors and organisers of the school are one and all representa-tives of otzovism, ultimatumism and god-building” (June 1909, Works, Vol.
XIV, pp.
89-103).
* Social affairs are touched upon still more scantily in the letters of the following years, which were, in general, fewer.
The first years of the second exile abroad were particu-larly dull and miserable and were a sad experience for Vla-dimir Ilyich.
I saw that for myself when I visited him in Paris in the autumn of 1911.
He seemed to be less vivacious than usual.
One day when we were out walking together he said to me: “I wonder if I shall manage to live to the next revolution.
” The sad expression on his face reminded me of the photograph of him taken in 1895 by the secret police.
The time was one of profound reaction.
Only a few signs of a renascence were to be seen—the publication of Zvezda and Mysl, for example.
A note of pleasure resounded in his letter of January 3, 1911.
“Yesterday I received Zvezda No.
1.
from Russia and today Mysl No.
1.
That is something to cheer me up!.
.
.
It really is a pleasure!”** His depression was deepened, of course, by the “bitter squabbles”, which had a bad effect on work; Vladimir Ilyich wrote about this in 1910, having in mind the differences that existed between the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad and the Vpe-ryod group.
He referred to “a period so full of squabbles” in his letter of January 3, 1911, and apologised to my husband for his unpunctuality in answering letters.
It can be seen from his letters that Vladimir Ilyich’s mood greatly improved after he moved to Krakow in the autumn of 1912.
He wrote that he felt better than in Paris, he was resting his nerves, there was more literary work and fewer squabbles.
The work for Pravda, the improved situation in working-class circles and in revolutionary work naturally had a beneficial effect on Vladimir Ilyich.
There was a noticeable lessening of the squabbles, so much so that Gorky, Vladimir Ilyich wrote, was less unfriendly * Collected Works, Vol.
15, pp.
425-51.
—Ed.
** Letter No.
215.
—Ed.
towards us.
It will be remembered that it was shortly after this that Gorky became one of the editors of the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye.
Vladimir Ilyich wrote of the proposal for Pravda to publish pamphlets; he said that he was seeing more people from Russia and seemed to feel closer to Russia; he invited my husband, Mark Yelizarov, to the health resort at Za-kopane, saying that trains went there direct from War-saw; he also invited me, hinting that people living in the frontier zone could make the journey for thirty kopeks.
In general he was pleased with Krakow and wrote that he was not thinking of moving anywhere “unless the war chases us away, but I do not greatly believe in the war”.
* I moved to St.
Petersburg in the autumn of 1913 where I was employed by the Bolshevik journal Prosveshcheniye, the journal Rabotnitsa and also Pravda.
In addition to the letters in invisible ink, I had at that time a considerable correspondence with Vladimir Ilyich on literary matters; they were addressed to the office of Prosveshcheniye in the name of Andrei Nikolayevich.
Out of this official corres-pondence I have so far been able to recover only two letters that had been copied by the police and which are not included in this collection of letters to relatives.
During the war, of course, letters were fewer and many of them were lost.
The few that were preserved, even the postcards, touch upon questions that were most painful for Vladimir Ilyich.
A postcard dated February 1, 1910 said, “We have been having ‘stormy’ times lately, but they have ended with an attempt at peace with the Mensheviks—yes, yes, strange as it may seem; we have closed down the fac-tional newspaper and are trying harder to promote unity.
We shall see whether it can be done.

In his letter of November 14, 1914 he wrote, “It is very sad to watch the growth of chauvinism in a number of countries and to see such treacherous acts as those of the German * (and not only the German) Marxists or pseudo-Marxists.
.
.
.
It stands to reason that the liberals are prais-ing Plekhanov again; he has fully deserved that shameful punishment.
.
.
.
I have seen the disgraceful, shameless issue of Sovremenny Mir.
.
.
.
Shame! Shame!”** Official correspondence in invisible ink became more intensive in those years, when all correspondence with the Central Committee was greatly reduced, and in the only postcard from Vladimir Ilyich that has been preserved for the year 1915 he thanked me “very, very, very much for the book, for the most interesting collection of pedagogical publications and for the letter”.
The collection of peda-gogical publications was “interesting”, of course, on account of what was written between the lines in invisible ink.
In Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to his relatives, therefore, we see his comments on the struggle for the correct under-standing of Marxism and for its correct application at the various stages of development of the proletarian movement which he conducted throughout his life.
Now let me try to draw some conclusions on the basis of these letters, to show in brief those aspects of Vladimir Ilyich’s personality, the features of his character, that, in my opinion, stand out in his letters to his relatives.
The first thing we notice (and this has been mentioned in the reviews of the letters published in part in Prole-tarskaya Revolyutsiya) is the permanence of his attach-ment, his enduring, unchanging attitude towards the same people in the course of many long years.
It is true that these are his immediate relatives, but the permanence of his affection, the steadiness and stability of his character are * The voting of the German Social-Democrats for war credits on August 4, 1914.
** Containing an article by Iordansky, “Let There Be Victory!” (See Letter No.
253.
—Ed.
)clearly delineated in these letters.
We can also see from the same letters the permanence of his conviction and his faith in his cause; in Vladimir Ilyich’s letters to people who were close to him, such people as one could be most out-spoken with, there is not the slightest vacillation or doubt, not the slightest tendency to veer in any other direction.
Nor do we see any traces of whining and despondency in him—such behaviour is, in general, not in keeping with his character—or any complaints about his position, be it in prison, in exile in Siberia or abroad, or even any sour note in his descriptions.
Of course, this was also because most of the letters were addressed to mother, who had suffered so much on account of her children, a fact of which Vladimir Ilyich, who deeply loved and respected his mother, was profoundly aware.
He felt that his own personal activi-ties were causing his mother a great deal of worry and pain and as far as lay in his power he tried to make things easier for her.
His energy could be felt in letters to other members of the family as well, even to those who were at various times living apart from mother.
I remember, for instance, the letters he wrote me between 1900 and 1902, when I was living abroad, and which I naturally had to destroy before I returned to Russia.
I remember that his letters were always refreshing and an antidote to all depression and ner-vousness; they inspired enthusiasm and made one pull oneself together morally.
His self-confidence did not, how-ever, crush one; it gave one energy and an urge to greater self-fulfilment; his witty jokes filled one with the joy of living and this was the best lubrication for any kind of work.
His letters display a great sensitiveness to the mood of the other person and friendly, comradely attention to him—this can be seen in his solicitude for his mother and other members of the family and his solicitude for his com-rades—his questions and tales about them when he was in prison, in exile or abroad (see, for example, the letters of March 15 and April 5, 1897).
At the same time one notices the simplicity and the natural manner of Vladimir Ilyich, his great modesty, the complete absence not only of conceit and boastfulness but of any attempt to play up the services he had rendered or toshow off; and this was in his youth, when some sort of show-ing off is natural in a talented person.
For a long time he would not agree to call his big, fundamental monograph The Development of Capitalism in Russia, which, he said, “is too bold, too broad and promises too much .

and should be more modest” (February 13, 1899) and the argument that the book would sell better with that title he “did not like” either (January 10, 1899).
* All the labour that he devoted to the study of material for his book on philosophy and other works while in prison, in exile and later when he was abroad, the writing of legal and illegal pamphlets and articles, many of which were lost—all this labour he regarded as something perfectly natural and normal.
Here his tremendous industry, his natural restraint and his tenacity in carrying through what-ever he had undertaken are also apparent.
The time limits fixed for The Development of Capitalism in Russia or for certain chapters of the book were, as a rule, kept to, as can be seen from the letters printed below.
Since he was exacting to himself he was naturally exact-ing to others.
He always gave many instructions and insisted on their being carried out; he trained everybody who at any time worked with him in the accuracy and thorough-ness that was his own.
Vladimir Ilyich was always displeased with unpunctuality, with delays in work, in carrying out instructions or in answering letters.
In his letters sent from exile he inveighs against Struve for his slackness in answer-ing; in the letters of 1908-09 he expresses his displeasure with Comrade Skvortsov-Stepanov for his careless reading of the proofs of Materialism and Empirio-criticism, which he had undertaken to correct, and so on.
From Vladimir Ilyich’s letters we can also see his great modesty and his complete lack of fastidiousness in life, his ability to be content with little; no matter what con-ditions fate provided for him he always wrote that he need-ed nothing and was eating well—whether it was in Siberia where he had to provide everything for himself out of an allowance of eight rubles a month, or when he was living abroad and we were able to check up on him during * See Letters Nos.

—Ed.
our rare visits and were always able to prove that he had far from enough to eat.
He was always worried by the fact that his circumstances forced him to accept financial aid from mother longer than is usual, instead of helping her.
On October 5, 1893, he wrote, “.
.
.
The expenditure is still excessive—38 rubles in a month.
Obviously I have not been living carefully; in one month I have spent a ruble and 36 kopeks on the horse trams, for instance.
When I get used to the place I shall probably spend less.
” * Later, too, he was worried and asked mother not to send him money and not to save money from her pension when he heard that this was what she wanted to do on learning of his strait-ened circumstances from a letter sent to someone else (letter of January 19, 1911).
He was also embarrassed at having to take money from the Party, when his income from writing was not enough to live on.
With some bitterness Vladimir Ilyich related Na-dezhda Krupskaya’s joke that he “must have been ‘pen-sioned off ’”, when money came to him from Russia (Fe-bruary 15, 1917).
** For reasons of economy Vladimir Ilyich tried wherever possible to use books from libraries.
He spent next to noth-ing on amusements; visits to theatres and concerts were so rare that they could not affect his budget (see letter of Feb-ruary 9, 1901).
Vladimir Ilyich, indeed, preferred the open air to social forms of recreation, where there were a lot of people.
“Here,” he wrote from Stjernsund (Finland) on his return from the Fifth Party Congress, “you can have a wonderful rest, swimming, walking, no people and no work.
No people and no work—that is the best thing for me” (June 27, 1907).
The walk is a pleasure although I have to walk about 5 versts a day, an hour’s walk, he wrote from Siberia in 1897.
*** With their rucksacks on their backs, he and his wife would wander over the mountain slopes and passes of Swit-zerland.
He climbed in the Alps and when he lived near Krakow he went climbing in the Tatras.
It was not only such * Letter No.

outstanding beauties of nature that attracted him; he rode or walked round the environs of big cities such as London or Munich.
“We are the only people among the comrades here who are exploring every bit of the surrounding country.
We discover various ‘rural’ paths, we know all the places nearby and intend to go further afield.
” * “We find the road to out-of-the-way places to which none of the exiles ever go.
” He was interested in sport-shooting, skating, cycling and chess, and engaged in these amusements with all the ingenuousness of a youth or even a boy.
He describes some of his mountain trips very vividly, if briefly—the trip to Salève near Geneva, for instance, or his Shu-shu-shu in Siberia.
In the letters there is also evidence of Vladimir Ilyich’s ability to make the most of the present moment; in pris-on, in exile and in the worst times abroad he delved into scientific and theoretical problems, erected and strength-ened, so to speak, the scientific buttresses of the cause to which he devoted his life—work for the proletarian revolu-tion—at times when fate decreed that he must remain more or less aloof from direct participation.
And when life brought him into greater contact with people—in the country, travel-ling, in trains—he showed his ability to take in reality, to understand the masses, to rise to generalisations from minor facts and to determine and consolidate the line that leads from theory and the general ideals of life to life as it really is and back again.
He showed his ability to gather impressions from everywhere, from all conversations, from letters.
We see how Vladimir Ilyich hungered after ordinary letters that simply drew a picture of the life around one with-out setting out to achieve any general aims, how hungry he was for them and asked for them to be sent more often.
And, lastly, we see in these letters Vladimir Ilyich’s ability to maintain his composure and equilibrium both in prison and after (see the letter with his advice to our sister Maria, May 19, 1901), how, after imprisonment or various social and political disturbances that had undermined this equilibrium, he would make determined efforts to return to normal.
He realised that this equilibrium was * Letter No.
148.
—Ed.
essential for the mental or political work that was the aim of his life.
For the same reason he spent the whole three years of his exile in Shushenskoye, never asking for a trans-fer to a town in the way most exiles did.
He wrote that temporary visits to the town were better than permanent residence there.
Speaking of the suicide of Fedoseyev he wrote, “For people in exile, these ‘exile scandals’ are the worst thing of all.
” “No, don’t wish me comrades from among the intellectuals in Shushenskoye—I’d rather not!” (January 24, 1898).
* In bringing to a close this brief indication of the traits and peculiarities in the character of Vladimir Ilyich which, in my opinion, are shown by the letters to his relatives published below, I hope that they will help the reader to gain a clearer picture and a closer understanding of Vla-dimir Ilyich as a person.

LENIN 1897QX 1 TO HIS MOTHER 1 October 5 Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your letter of October 2.
At long last I have found myself a good room, or so it seems; there are no other lodgers and the landlady has a small family; the door between my room and their drawing-room is papered over, so that sounds are faint.
The room is clean and light.
There is a good entrance.
Since, in addition, it is not far from the centre (only some 15 minutes’ walk from the library) I am quite satisfied.
I saw Tillo yesterday and today.
He did not get the ticket and, unfortunately, cannot get it because the person he was counting on is not here.
Incidentally, he says that when his own position in the provisional railway admin-istration is more secure, perhaps he will be able to.
That, it seems, will not be soon.
I went to Volkov Cemetery soon after my arrival— everything, the cross and wreath, is intact.
2 Your loving, V.
Ulyanov Please send me some money, mine is nearly at an end.
* I have been informed from Samara that the fee for the Grafov case (the Kazan case that I conducted in Samara) has been promised for November.
That will give me 70 rubles (if the promise is fulfilled, and what chance there is of that, I don’t know).
I have been promised a job in a consulting lawyer’s office here, but when that will be arranged (and whether it will be arranged) I do not know.
* I shall have to pay 10 rubles when I am appointed assistant, which should be soon.
Write and tell me about the state of your finances; did you get anything from Auntie? Did you get the September rent from Krushvits? Is there much left of the deposit (500 rubles) after moving and settling down? 3 I am now, for the first time in St.
Petersburg, keeping a cash-book to see how much I actually spend.
It turned out that for the month August 28 to September 27 I spent altogether 54 rubles 30 kopeks, not including payment for things (about 10 rubles) and expenses for a court case (also about 10 rubles) which I shall probably conduct.
It is true that part of this 54 rubles was spent on things that do not have to be bought every month (galoshes, clothes, books, an abacus, etc.
), but even discounting that (16 rubles), the expenditure is still excessive—38 rubles in a month.
Obviously I have not been living carefully; in one month I have spent a ruble and 36 kopeks on the horse trams, for instance.
When I get used to the place I shall probably spend less.

4 TO HIS SISTER MARIA December 24 Manyasha, At last I have found time to answer your letter of the 15th.
I cannot agree with your views of the school and your studies.
First—the doctor said don’t go till Christmas and you think it will not be convenient to miss your lessons.
People miss months, not only weeks; it will not be any better if you have to take to your bed by the spring.
Secondly—you write that either you will stop studying altogether or, if you go on, you can’t be “just off-hand about it”.
It seems to me that the main thing now is to graduate.
For that there is no sense in working extra hard; what does it matter if you get threes * and an occasional two * by way of exception? In any case you will get your remove since you had good marks in the first and second terms.
And that is all you need.
Moreover, since you did everything thoroughly at the beginning, you will finish up well even if you do no homework.
You must agree that those who go all the way through with threes do not, first, do their homework and, second, do not know the first thing about the subject.
[At least that is how it was at my school.
] So you will have an advantage over them.
It seems to me that your only chance of finishing the course is to be “off-hand” about it.
If you don’t, you will be seriously ill by summer.
* In Russian schools a mark of “three”= fair, “two”= poor.
—Ed.
If you cannot take things easy, then it is better to give up studying and go abroad.
You will always be able to graduate and a trip now will freshen you up, enliven you, and get you away from moping at home.
You will have a chance to look around and stay on there to learn something more interesting than Ilovaisky’s History or Filaret’s Cate-chism (?).
Do you take good walks now? Probably not.
Why shouldn’t you go skating? Again you’ll say, “ It’s dull ” .
But you must not allow yourself to get so weak—that will be even less “amusing”.
You must force yourself.
About Shelgunov, I agree with you that some of his things are out of date.
Which of his articles do you like? On Russian or historical problems? On economics or philos-ophy? Yours, V.

ULYANOVA 18986 TO HIS MOTHER May 20 (8) I wrote the last letter on the way here.
Now I have settled down in one place.
I do not think, however, that it will be for long as I shall be moving on somewhere.
The scenery here is splendid, I am enjoying it all the time.
The Alps began immediately after the little German station I wrote to you from; then came the lakes and I could not tear myself away from the window of the railway carriage; if I could find out something about local condi-tions and prices (one could surely put up cheaply in the country districts) it would perhaps be possible to spend the summer here.
The fare is not much and the scenery is splendid.
I have seen my god-daughter and her family.
12 We spoke, incidentally, on the subject of prices which Mark raised.
* I seems that servants are very expensive here— 25 to 30 francs a month, all found—and they have to be fed well.
Have you found a place for the summer at last? I do not need the address, I suppose, because I can always write to Mark, but I should like.

7 TO HIS MOTHER Paris, 8 juin 95 I received your letter just before I left for Paris.
It is a pity things turned out so badly over Mitya’s illness; I don’t understand how they can refuse to postpone his examination if he has a doctor’s certificate to the effect that he has been ill.
Why doesn’t he want to take the matter further? Why should he lose a year? Manyasha is probably finishing or has finished her exam-inations by now.
She ought to have a good rest this summer.
I am only just beginning to look round me a bit in Paris; it is a huge city, spread out a good deal, so that the suburbs (where I spend most of my time) give you no idea of the centre.
It makes a very pleasant impression—broad, light streets, many boulevards, and lots of greenery; the people are quite unrestrained in their manners—at first it comes as rather a surprise after one had been accustomed to the sedateness and primness of St.
Petersburg.
I shall have to spend several weeks here to see it properly.
Lodgings here are very cheap; for instance, 30 to 35 francs a month for two rooms and a kitchen, 6 to 10 francs a week for a furnished room—so I hope to get fixed up without spending too much.

Printed from the original8 TO HIS MOTHER 18 juillet (July 6), 1895 I wrote my last letter, unless I am mistaken, on the 8th.
Since then I have wandered about quite a lot and have landed up at a Swiss spa; I have decided to take advantage of the fact and get down seriously to the treatment of the ill-ness (stomach) that I am so fed up with, especially as the doctor who runs the place has been strongly recommended to me as a specialist in his field.
I have been living at this spa for several days and feel not at all bad; the board is excellent and the treatment seems to be effective, so I hope to get away from here in four or five days.
The cost of living here, as far as I can see, is very high; treatment is still more expensive, and I have already exceeded my budget and no longer expect to manage on my own resources.

1 1 Printed from the original9 TO HIS MOTHER Berlin, den 10.
August 1895 I do not know whether you received my last letter which I sent from here about a week ago.
I will repeat my address, just in case: Berlin, Moabit, Flensburgerstrasse, 12 II (bei Frau Kurreick) Herrn W.
Ulianoff.
I am fixed up here very well—a few steps away from me is the Tiergarten (a splendid park, the best and biggest in Berlin), the Spree, where I bathe every day, and a station of the urban railway.
There is a railway here that traverses the whole town (above the streets).
The trains run every five minutes, so it is easy for me to go “to town” (Moabit, where I am living, is actually considered a suburb).
The only bad thing is the language—I understand far less conversational German than French.
The pronunciation of the Germans is so unlike what I am accustomed to that I do not even understand public speeches, although in France I understood practically everything in such speeches from the very outset.
The day before yesterday I was at the theatre; they played Hauptmann’s The Weavers.
Although I had read the whole play beforehand in order to be able to follow it, I could not catch all the phrases.
Still, I am not discouraged and only regret that I have too little time to study the language thoroughly.

I am still living in the same way and am so far pleased with Berlin.
I feel very well—perhaps the regular life [I got tired of moving from place to place and, travelling like that, I did not manage to eat properly or regularly], the bathing and so on, according to doctor’s orders, are having their effect.
I am still working in the Königliche Bibliothek * and in the evenings I wander about studying the Berlin mores and listening to German speech.
I am now getting used to it and understand it somewhat better than before, but still very, very poorly.
I am lazy about visiting the Berlin Sehenswürdigkeiten ** ; I have little taste for such things in general and in most cases have seen them only by accident.
In general, I much prefer wandering around and seeing the evening amuse-ments and pastimes of the people to visiting museums, theatres, shopping centres, etc.
I do not think I shall be staying here long—“visiting is all very well, but there is no place like home”.
I am going to remain here for a while, however, and to my great horror see that I am again in financial “difficul-ties ” ; the “temptation” to buy books, etc.

I am surprised to hear of such a great difference in the weather; you write that it is cold in Moscow, but here it is hotter than it was all through August, so I thought you were probably still living in the country.
There have been no changes in my way of life here and I have got so used to it that I feel myself almost at home and would willingly stay longer; but the time has come to leave and I am beginning to think of various practical problems like buying things and a suitcase, and about tickets, etc.
Is there anything I can bring you? I can buy anything here in some big shop; it seems to me manufac-tured goods here are cheaper than ours and probably better.
Perhaps Mitya needs some books—let him write [for instance he may need some album of anatomy, or something else to do with medicine] and Manyasha, too.

I am not very pleased with the room, first, because of the landlady’s fault-finding, and second—it seems that the next room is separated from mine by only a thin partition, so that everything can be heard and sometimes I have to run away from the balalaika with which my neighbour amuses himself right in my ear.
Up to now, this has fortunately not happened very often.
He is out most of the time, and then the rooms are very quiet.

Printed from the originalQXV 13 TO A.
K.
CHEBOTARYOVA16 January 2, 1896 I have a plan that has occupied my mind ever since I was arrested, and the more I think of it the more interested I become.
I have long been engaged on a certain economic problem (on the sale of manufactured goods on the home market).
I had gathered some literature on the subject, drawn up a plan of operations, and had even written some-thing, expecting to publish as a book if the size exceeds that of an article for a journal.
I am very anxious not to aban-don this work but I am apparently now faced with the alternative—either write it here or give it up altogether.
I am well aware that the plan to write it here will meet with many serious obstacles.
Perhaps, however, it is worth while trying.
Obstacles that one might call “independent” will, I think, be removed.
Prisoners are allowed to do literary work; I made a special point of asking the prosecutor about this, although I knew beforehand (even convicts in prison are allowed to write).
He also confirmed that there is no limit to the number of books I may receive.
Books, moreover, may be returned; consequently one can make use of libra-ries.
And so everything is all right from that point of view.
There are other, more serious obstacles—getting the books.
I need a lot of books—I am giving a list below of those which I have in mind at present—and to obtain them will require a considerable amount of trouble.
I do not even know wheth-er they can all be obtained.
It will probably be all right to count on the library of the Free Economic Society, 17 * * I have taken books from there and left a deposit of 16 rubles.
which allows books to be taken away for two months on payment of a deposit, but that library is not very complete.
If it were possible to use (through some writer or professor * ) the University library or the library of the learned commit-tee of the Ministry of Finance, the question of obtaining books would be settled.
Some books would have to be bought, of course, and I think I can allot a certain sum for that.
The last and most difficult problem is that of delivering the books.
It is not merely a matter of bringing a couple of books or so; at regular intervals, over a lengthy period they will have to be obtained from the libraries, brought here ** and taken back.
That is something I do not yet know how to arrange.
Unless it can be done this way—find some door porter or janitor, or a messenger or some boy whom I could pay to go for books.
The exchange of books— because of the conditions under which I work and also because of the terms on which books are lent from the libra-ry—would, of course, have to be done correctly and punc-tually, so all that must be arranged.
“Easier said than done”.
.
.
.
I have a very strong feeling that this business will not be easy to carry out and that my “plan” may turn out to be more fantasy.
Perhaps you will think it useful to pass this letter on to somebody, to get some advice—and I will await an answer.
The book list is divided into the two parts into which my essay is divided: A.
The general theoretical part.
This requires fewer books and I hope, at any rate, to write this part, even though it requires greater preparation.
B.
The application of theoretical postulates to Russian data.
This part requires very many books.
The chief difficulties will be caused by (1) publications of local authorities—some of them, incidentally, I have; some can be ordered (minor monographs) and some can be obtained through statisticians with whom we, are acquainted; (2) government publica-tions—the records made by commissions, the reports and.

14 TO HIS SISTER ANNA January 12, 1896 I got your parcel yesterday and just before yours some-body else brought me food of all kinds, so I have now got quite a stock—I could, for instance, start trading in tea, but I don’t think it would be allowed because I should certainly win the competition with the shop here.
I eat very little bread, I try to maintain something of a diet—and you brought such enormous quantities that I think it will last me almost a week and get as hard as the Sunday pie at Oblomovka.
18 I now have everything I need, and even more than I need.
* My health is quite satisfactory.
I even get my mineral water here—it is brought to me from the chemists’ on the day I order it.
I sleep about nine hours a day and see various chapters of my future book in my sleep.

15 TO HIS SISTER ANNA January 14, 1896 Yesterday I received your letter of the 12th and am sending you a second letter of attorney.
Actually I am not sure it is necessary; yesterday I got some of my things, which made me think my first letter giving power of attor-ney had been received.
In any case I am sending one, in answer to your letter and Alexandra Kirillovna’s.
Now I have underclothes and everything—quite enough; do not send any underclothes as there is nowhere to keep them.
But they can be sent to the storeroom, so as to end the matter once and for all.
I am very thankful to A.
K.
for the trouble she took about the dentist; I am ashamed of having caused so much bother.
The dentist does not require a special pass because the pro-secutor has already given permission and I did not even write to the dentist until I had received it.
The day and time he comes does not matter.
I cannot guarantee that I will not be absent—under interrogation, for instance—but I think the sooner he comes the greater the chance of avoid-ing that obstacle, which is not likely to occur in any case.
I shall not write to Mr.
Dobkovich (the dentist, assistant to Vazhinsky); he lives next to my former lodgings (Gore-khovaya, 59) and perhaps you will go to him and explain matters.
Regarding my own books, I have sent a list of those I should like to get.
* Thanks for the books by Golovin and Schippel sent yesterday.
From my own books I must add * The book list has been lost.
—Ed.
only dictionaries.
I am doing a translation from the Ger-man * and would ask you to send me Pavlovsky’s diction-ary.
I was sent some underclothes, apparently not mine; they must be returned.
When you are here you must ask them to bring you the underclothes and things I don’t need— and I will hand them over.
I am quite well.
V.
Ulyanov I am very glad to hear that Mother and Mark are better now.

16 TO HIS SISTER ANNA January 16, 1896 Yesterday I received your letter of the 14th and hasten to answer it, although there is not much hope of your receiv-ing my reply before Thursday.
19 I have already written about the need to return some underclothes that do not belong to me.
I have got the things together and you must now ask for them when you are here, or tell whoever comes to ask for them in your name.
I am not returning all of the things, because some are in the wash (perhaps you will ask somebody to get the rest later); I have allowed myself to keep, for the time being, a travelling rug that has done me excellent service here.
I have obtained information about the books; a small box may be left in the storeroom here.
* It is not, of course, worth while sending all my books here.
Some of the books in the list you sent me are not mine—for example, Fabrich-naya promyshlennost, Kobelyatsky—these are Alexandra Kirillovna’s and I think I took another book from her.
Then the publications of the Saratov Zemstvo 2 0 and the Zemstvo statistical reports for Voronezh Gubernia were lent me, I believe, by some statistician.
Perhaps you will find out whether they can be kept for a time.
It is not worth while bringing them here.
Pogozhev and Sbornik obyazatel-nikh postanovleni po SPB are not mine either, I think (could they be from the library?).
The legal codes and * You can put a few clothes in there, too—an overcoat and suit, a hat.
The waistcoat, frock coat and rug that were brought me can be taken back.
textbooks are obviously not needed at all.
At the moment the only books I should like you to bring me are Ricardo, Beltov, N.
— on, Ingram, and Foville.
The Zemstvo publica-tions (Tver, Nizhny Novgorod and Saratov) should be count-ed and be tied up in a bundle, * but do not bother to list them; I think you can also deliver that bundle to the store-room.
Then you will be finished with my books and not have to bother about them again.
I shall be able to get the books from the storeroom (after they have been examined).
I am afraid I am causing you too much trouble.
Please do not work too hard, especially in delivering books accord-ing to the list; there will be time for everything, and at the moment I have enough books.
Yours, V.
Ulyanov Please add some pillow-slips and towels to the list of linen.
I am re-reading Shelgunov with interest and am busy with Tugan-Baranovsky; he has published a sound piece of research but his diagrams, those at the end, for instance, are so confused that I must confess I do not understand them; I shall have to get Volume II of Capital.

QXW 17 TO HIS MOTHER Ob Station.
March 2 21 I am writing to you once more while I am on my way, Mother dearest.
The halt here is a long one and there is nothing to do, and I have decided to write yet another letter en route, my third.
I still have two more days’ journey ahead of me.
I drove across the Ob in a horse-sleigh and bought tickets to Krasnoyarsk.
Since traffic here is still “temporary”, I had to pay the old rates, which meant handing over 10 rubles for a ticket and 5 rubles for luggage for something like 700 versts! The way the trains run here is beyond all bounds.
To do that 700 versts we shall crawl for forty-eight hours.
Beyond Krasnoyarsk, the railway goes only as far as Kansk, i.
e.
, for 220 versts—and alto-gether to Irkutsk it is about 1,000 versts.
And so I shall have to go on by road—if I have to go at all.
Another 24 hours is taken up by those 220 versts on the railway; the further you go, the slower the trains crawl along.
You have to use a horse-sleigh to cross the Ob because the bridge is not ready, although its skeleton has been built.
The crossing was not too bad—but I was able to manage without warm (or rather the warmest) clothing only because it was a short one—less than an hour.
If I have to go to my destination by road (and I most probably shall have to), I shall obviously have to acquire a sheepskin coat, felt boots and even, perhaps, a fur cap (you see how spoiled I was in Russia! But how else am I expected to travel by sleigh?).
Despite the devilish slowness of the journey it has tired me far less than I expected.
I may even say that I am hard-ly tired at all.
I am surprised at this myself, because beforethis a journey of some three days from Samara to St.
Peters-burg would wear me out.
The fact of the matter most prob-ably is that I sleep very well every night without exception.
The country covered by the West-Siberian Railway that I have just travelled throughout its entire length (1,300 versts from Chelyabinsk to Krivoshchokovo—three days) is astonish-ingly monotonous—bare, bleak steppe.
No sign of life, no towns, very rarely a village or a patch of forest—and for the rest, all steppe.
Snow and sky—and nothing else for the whole three days.
They say that further on there will be taiga, and after that, beginning at Achinsk, mountains.
The air in the steppe, however, is wonderful; breathing is so easy.
There is a hard frost, more than twenty degrees below, but it is easier to bear here than in Russia.
It does not seem to me that it is twenty below.
The Siberians say it is because the air is “soft”, and that makes the frost easier to bear.
Quite probably it is so.
In the train I met the Arzt * that Anyuta visited in St.
Petersburg.
I learned a few things from him about Krasno-yarsk, etc.
, that will be useful to me.
He said that I should definitely be able to stay there for a few days.
That is what I think of doing, in order to find out what my position in the future will be.
If I send a telegram “staying a few days” that will mean that the length of my stay is not known even to me.
And so I shall wait there for the doctor, ** meet him, and if I do have to go on to Irkutsk, we shall go together.
According to that same person, I cannot expect any delay in my being appointed a place; most probably it has been decided already because the whole thing is arranged beforehand.
And so, until next time.
Yours, V.
U.
Regards to all.

My talk with the Arzt has made very much clear to me (even if only approximately), and for this reason I feel quite calm; I have left my nervousness behind in Moscow.
It was due to the uncertainty, nothing more.
Now there is less uncertainty and I therefore feel better.

2 -3 Printed from the original18 TO HIS SISTER MARIA 22 Manyasha, I got your letter from the doctor and was very glad to have some news from home.
I have received the bag Mother sent and think it will be very convenient.
I shall probably take advantage of your proposal to make extracts from books in the Rumyantsev Library.
23 Yesterday I managed to find the famous local library belonging to Yudin, who gave me a hearty welcome and showed me his collection.
He gave me permission to work in the library and I think I shall be able to.
(There are two obstacles in the way; first, his library is outside the town, although the distance is short, about two versts, so it will make a pleasant walk; second, the library is not fully organised, so I may be a nuisance to the owner by making frequent requests for books.
) We’ll see how it works out in practice.
I think the second obstacle, too, will be removed.
I have not seen all his library by far, but in any case it is an excellent collec-tion of books.
There are, for example, complete sets of journals (the most important) from the end of the eighteenth century up to date.
I hope I shall be able to make use of them for the information I need so much for my work.
I see from the newspapers that in the spring fast trains will be coming here—8 days from Paris * to Krasnoyarsk, which means six days from Moscow.
It will then be much more convenient to correspond.

Printed from the original19 TO HIS MOTHER March 15, 1897 All this time I have been on the look-out for letters from you, Mother dearest, but so far in vain; enquiries at the post office tell me nothing.
I am beginning to think that you have not written to me because you are waiting for the telegram I did not manage to send on arrival.
In view of the great length of postage time between us (i.
e.
, letters taking too long en route), you must write without waiting for an address.
If I am sent away from here I will leave word at the post office for letters to be forwarded.
So please write to me more often to the last address known to you—I am miserable without letters from home.
All I have had is Manyasha’s note, brought by the doctor.
Today I said good-bye to the doctor.
He went on to Ir-kutsk.
He was not allowed to stay here any longer, i.
e.
, the local authorities would not allow it.
So far I am not being troubled and I do not think they can bother me because I have sent an application to the Governor-General and am now awaiting a reply.
Incidentally, it is not abso-lutely impossible that I, too, shall have to make that journey.
In these parts the spring thaw is considered to begin from today and a journey by post horses becomes more expensive and more difficult.
The weather is excellent, real spring weather.
I spend my time here in two ways—first, in visit-ing Yudin’s library, and second, in getting to know the town of Krasnoyarsk and its inhabitants (many of them exiles).
24 I go to the library every day and since it is two versts from the outskirts of the town I have to walk some five versts; it takes about an hour.
I am very glad to have the walk and enjoy it, although it sometimes makes me quitesleepy.
There turned out to be far fewer books on my subject in the library than might have been expected from its gen-eral size; nevertheless there are some that are useful to me and I am very glad that I do not have to waste my time here completely.
I also visit the town library, where I can see journals and newspapers that arrive here on the eleventh day after publication, but I cannot get used to such old “news”.
If I have to live a few hundred versts from here, the post will take still longer and it will be still more neces-sary to write frequently without waiting for a reply; if you wait for a reply it will be more than a month! It is a great pity nothing is known about the party.
25 I have quite given up expecting a telegram from Anyuta and have decided that either she has not been able to find out anything, or that there has been a delay.
I have heard that no more columns are to come here on foot, which means that the party will come by rail.
If that is so, I cannot understand why they are being delayed in Moscow.
Will it be possible to pass books on? Food? Letters? If these questions are not too late I should be very glad to get an answer to them from Anyuta.
March 16.
I missed the post yesterday.
The train for Rus-sia leaves here late at night, but the station is a long way away.
Many kisses for you and my regards to everyone.
Tomor-row, perhaps, I shall try at last to send off to Anyuta the books that were borrowed for a short time.
Yours, V.
U.
Did my letter with the address arrive? Just in case, I shall repeat it—Bolshekachenskaya Street, House of Klav-diya Popova.
You may also write Poste restante and I will ask for letters at the post office.
When I leave here, letters will be forwarded.

2 -3 Printed from the original20 TO HIS MOTHER March 26, 1897 At last, Mother dearest, I have received news of you and am very glad.
First, I have received a telegram in answer to mine.
I had inquired at the station but there was nothing there.
The Schwester * found your letter there later, and Anyuta’s must, therefore, have been lost.
Second-ly, I got a telegram just after nine yesterday evening say-ing they were leaving, was overjoyed about it and ran head-long to the Schwester to share my joy with her.
Now we are counting the days and are “travelling” by the mailtrain that left Moscow on the 25th.
The last telegram I understood to mean that they are travelling at their own expense, other-wise it would not have been signed by Glob.
I think he has also sent a telegram to his mother 26 in Chelyabinsk, other-wise he might travel past her while she is sitting and wait-ing for news! (The Schwester’s letter to her was posted not long ago, so she will probably not yet have left.
) I am very thankful to Manyasha for her letter and for the extracts from letters received.
I am enclosing herewith a reply to one of those extracts—let Manyasha deal with it as before.
I count on exploiting her further for letter-writing and even for literary work.
You may send me books and letters here; I don’t know yet when they’ll chase me out and whore to.
It would probably be better to send them to the Schwes-ter, and register the more important ones for there seems to be a terrible lot of carelessness at the post office here and letters, apparently, get lost (to that, I suppose, must be added outside hindrances **).

There is nothing new I can write about myself; my life goes on as usual.
I stroll to the library outside town, I stroll in the neighbourhood, I stroll round to my acquaintances and sleep enough for two—in short, everything is as it should be.
Yours, V.
U.
I am sending Anyuta a list of those books I should very much like to obtain and which, it seems, can be bought only in the St.

I am very angry with myself for getting one name wrong (or rather, one year) in a letter from the remand prison, and making Anyuta travel about for noth-ing.
Could not a search also be made in the Moscow libraries? Perhaps they are to be found somewhere.

Printed from the original21 TO HIS MOTHER April 5, 1897 Today there was good news, Mother dearest, and I hasten to tell you about it.
First, I received a telegram from the doctor in Irkutsk, “Hear you being sent Minusinsk”.
Second-ly, A.
M.
has at last learned the Governor-General’s reply— Gleb and Basil are also being sent to Minusinsk District.
E.
E.
will be arriving tomorrow and will press for their release and also ask permission for them to travel at their own expense.
I expect she will succeed (judging by precedents we know of).
27 I am very pleased with my place of exile (if the rumours prove true, and I do not think they are wrong) because Mi-nusinsk and its district are the best in these parts both on account of the excellent climate and the low cost of living.
The distance from Krasnoyarsk is not very great, the post goes there two or three times a week, so that to send a letter and get an answer will take 30 to 35 days instead of the present 22 or 23 days—no more.
I do not expect I shall be able to leave before the river is open to navigation, because the spring thaw and floods are now at their height.
and the party on its way, to Irkutsk is being kept here until May.
When the river is open to navigation it is possible to go to Minusinsk by steamer.
It is a great pity no attempt was made to get Anatoly Alexandrovich sent to Minusinsk District, too; it would be very, very good for him after the pleurisy he has had.
We sent a telegram to St.
Petersburg asking them to set things going; since there has been a delay of the whole party there is now ample time, so we may hope they willbe able to get him sent there if they tackle the job energet-ically.
For the time being letters should, of course, be sent to me at the old address; if I go away I will leave the new address and they will be sent on to me.
I think you can send my books on now, without waiting for the final address; in any case you cannot send goods to Minusinsk (there is no carrier’s office there), and they take a long time to come here by rail.
So send them here, to A.
M.
’s address, if no other, or, better still, addressed to the bearer of the receipt, and send the receipt by registered post to A.
M.
From here the goods can be sent on to Minusinsk by boat in the spring.
They say that Gleb and Basil look very ill—pale, yellow and terribly tired.
They will probably get better when they come out.
I am in good health and am living quite well; the weather is marvellous.
I intend to write Manyasha a letter in a “lit-erary” vein; I do not know, however, whether that inten-tion will be put into effect.
I have seen Novoye Slovo 28 and read it with great pleasure.

2 -3 Printed from the original22 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA April 17, 1897 Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received three of your let-ters.
Today I collected some detailed information about the villages we are being sent to (officially I have not yet been informed of this 29 ).
I am going to the village of Shu-shenskoye (I think I spelt it wrongly in previous letters— Shushinskoye).
It is a big village with more than fifteen hundred inhabitants, where there are the volost council, the office of the Zemstvo assessor (he is the same as a super-intendent of police in Russia, but has greater powers), a school, etc.
The village stands on the right bank of the Ye-nisei, fifty-six versts to the south of Minusinsk.
Since the volost authorities are quartered there the post will be fairly regular—I have heard there is a post twice a week.
You go by steamer to Minusinsk (the steamers do not go further up the Yenisei) and by horse transport the rest of the way.
Today the ice broke on the Yenisei, so in seven to ten days the steamers will probably begin and I expect to leave at the end of April or the beginning of May.
You can and should write to my present address, * because I shall leave a request to forward my letters when I go.
I cannot, however, tell you exactly when I shall be going.
Gleb and Basil are going to the village of Tesinskoye, also the seat of a volost council, etc.
, thirty-seven versts to the north of Minusinsk on the River Tuba (a right tributary of the Yenisei).
A telegram about them was sent to the Police * I now receive all your letters regularly.
The first must have been lost at the station where there is not much order.
Department today asking for permission for them to travel at their own expense.
I hope the permission will be granted at the mother’s request, she is ill all the time here, and then we shall go to Minusinsk together.
I shall, therefore, spend the summer in “Siberian Italy”, as the people here call the south of Minusinsk District.
I cannot yet say whether this name is deserved or not, but people say that the Krasnoyarsk region is not so good.
The environs along the River Yenisei of even this town, incidentally, remind me of Zhiguli or of Swiss scenery; I have recently taken a number of walks (the days were quite warm here and the roads are already dry) and have enjoyed them very much.
I should have enjoyed them more if it were not for thoughts of our Turukhansk people and our Minusinsk prisoners.
30 I live very well here; I have comfortable lodgings, and am especially pleased with the full board.
For my work I have obtained some books on statistics (I think I have already written about that * ) but I do not do much work; mostly I just roam about the place.
Thank Manyasha for her letter; I have given her so much work now that I am afraid she will get fed up with figures.
31 My books should be sent to Krasnoyarsk to be delivered to the bearer of the receipt (either by goods train or through a carrier’s office, whichever is better) and I will then ask acquaintances to send them on to Minusinsk, and there again I shall have to look for acquaintances—there is no other way.
Why is Mitya thinking of going where there is plague? 32 If he is so anxious to travel and practice medicine I am ready to suggest a place at some resettlement centre.
In Eastern Siberia, for instance.
I have heard, incidentally, that a resettlement centre is to be opened in “my” village of Shushenskoye, Minusinsk District, Yenisei Gubernia.

.

So he is welcome.
We can go shooting together—if only Siberia can manage to make a sportsman out of me, and if he does not find work (and shooting) for himself in places not so far distant.

jokes aside, however, I really am surprised at his “plague” plans; I hope there will not be any plague, and that he will not have to go there.

Anyuta, About books—how to send them, see above.
What to send? If I get a fee of some 150 rubles 33 (perhaps in three doses, a teaspoonful every hour—every month, that is), then you can spend some on books.
Then buy me the last three issues of Promysly Vladimirskoi gubernii (3 rubles 75 kopeks), Vliyaniye urozhayev, etc.
, by Chuprov and Posnikov (5 rubies), Ukazatel fabrik i zavodov za 1890 god, St.
Petersburg, 1894 (5 rubles?).
I will give you further titles later—depending on the size of the fee, which need not be sent all at once (to the Schwester, of course).
Write and tell the writer * that I should be very glad if he would let me have part of my fee, and if he would agree to send me books instead of money—Russian and foreign, some for review and others for myself.
He knows the subjects I am interested in and he could send the books to you.
I should be glad to take all sorts of things for translation and could distribute them among the people in Minusinsk and Turukhansk ** (not very urgent), taking the organisation of the work upon myself and guaranteeing its timely and cor-rect fulfilment.
That, however, is something special, but I should very much like to arrange for the fees to be paid in books—only if that will not be too much trouble for the writer *** (add this, word for word).
I think I shall have to subscribe to journals and newspa-pers—there probably will not be anything in Shushenskoye.
Depending on available finances, you may subscribe to * Here and further the “writer” (écrivain) referred to is P.

Fedoseyev has been sent, I have been told, to the town of Kirensk in Irkutsk Gubernia.
*** I rely entirely on his choice, and this method of payment interests me because it is the only way for me to receive immediately important new publications; the timeliness of articles and reviews is very important in magazine work.
If I must first find out here and then order by post, the delay will be five weeks, minimum (!!!).
Russkiye Vedomosti, Russkoye Bogatstvo, Vestnik Finan-sov 34 (without any supplements), Archiv für soziale Gesetz-gebung und Statistik.
35 That makes quite a lot, so they may be ordered only if there are big receipts.
If money is short, Russkiye Vedomosti will, perhaps, be enough.
You will see for yourself, especially when I write from Shushen-skoye and inform you of my budget.
(I believe you are angry with the écrivain; when you write to him in my name, do not show it.
I bear no “rancune” * because of the loss of my last “literature”.

Printed from the original23 TO HIS MOTHER Minusinsk, May 7, 1897 We arrived here, Mother dearest, only yesterday.
37 Tomorrow we intend to go to our villages, and I wanted to write to you in greater detail about our journey here, which proved to be very expensive and very uncomfortable (so there is no sense in your coming here), but I don’t know whether I shall manage it because today I am quite worn out after the journey and tomorrow I shall probably be even busier.
If I do not manage to write in greater detail tomorrow, I shall confine myself to what is written here, so that you have some news of me, and will postpone a detailed letter until I arrive at “Shu-shu-shu”.

as I call the place where I shall eventually find peace.

2 -3 Printed from the original24 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA May 18, 1897 This week, Mother dearest, I received two letters from you (dated April 20 and 24) and am answering the latter by the first post from here, which leaves this evening.
Write and tell me when you get the letter from here, on which day, that is.
Your letters took so long to reach me because they were forwarded from Krasnoyarsk and a lot of time was wasted sending them on.
About finance—I do not remember your asking me twice (as you write in your letter of April 24), or perhaps I have forgotten it.
As long as my finances were good I did not write.
But before I left Krasnoyarsk (about the 26th or 28th), I sent a registered letter with a request for some money, which is prob-ably now on its way here from, Krasnoyarsk 38 .
Later, I also wrote from here saying that I should have enough for about a fortnight.
As far as concerns your idea of coming here only to beg a change of residence for me—it is really not worth while.
First, I could probably obtain permission to move myself, if I were to set about it.
Secondly, the village of Tesinskoye is hardly likely to be any better than Shusha.
According to the preliminary information we gathered earlier, Tesin-skoye is much worse than Shusha as a place, for the shoot-ing, etc.
Thirdly, the journey here is not so simple—I have already written about this and will write again today in greater detail to Manyasha; she accuses me (I am joking, of course) of “being horribly inhospitable”.
So far I have had no letters from Tesinskoye 39 , but as I know nothing about them I shall not do anything; it is possible they will ask to be sentsomewhere else if Tes turns out in reality to be as bad as we have heard.
Shu-shu-shu is not a bad village.
It is true it is in a rather bare locality, but not far away (one and a half to two versts) there is a forest, although much of it has been felled.
There is no road to the Yenisei but the River Shush flows right past the village and there is a fairly big tributary of the Yenisei not far away (one or one and a half versts), where you can bathe.
The Sayan Mountains or spurs from them are visible on the horizon; some of them are quite white, the snow on them probably never melts.
And so we have some-thing artistic here, too; it was not for nothing that when I was in Krasnoyarsk I tried writing verses “In Shusha at Sayan’s foot.
.
.
” but, unfortunately, I got no further than the first line! I am surprised that you do not write a word about sending me the remainder of the books.
It would be a pity if they have not yet been sent (I wrote about this a long time ago from Krasnoyarsk * ).
Now the steamers will be going as far as Minusinsk (the water is rising rapidly), so a bale can easily be sent here,.
Later it will be difficult again, for the Yenisei has lots of shallows, and, high water will not last long.
Perhaps, however, the books have been sent? As for my complaints that you do not write very often, that is all a matter of the past and was due to the amazing (for us, who are unaccustomed to such things) delay in receiving answers to our letters, I remember I wrote about it a month or six weeks ago, so it must have referred to the letters you wrote at the end of March! I now receive letters more often than before and I do not think that they get lost because the loss of some would be revealed when the next were received.
Apparently not a single letter has gone astray, except the first one that Anyuta sent to the station.
Here in the village I shall have to work still harder at my correspondence, so it will be better if letters come more frequently from “Russia”.
You say that “Anya says the reply to the editors has been read”.
I do not quite understand this.
Did she read the reply herself or have the editors already had time to * See Letter No.

e.
, somebody from the editorial office? 40 I am waiting for a letter from her.
Have you subscribed to a paper for me? I have no papers at all here.
They are also needed in Minu-sinsk since there is no reading-room there.
Regards to Mark.
He never lets me know how he is.
I can inform him and Mitya that the shooting here, apparent-ly, is not at all bad.
Yesterday I travelled about 12 versts to shoot duck and great snipe.
There is a lot of game, but without a dog the shooting is difficult, especially for such a poor shot as I.
There are even wild goats, and in the mountains and in the taiga (30-40 versts from here, where the local peasants sometimes go shooting) there are squirrel, sable, bear and deer.
I am sorry I did not take a waterproof.
It is indispensable here.
Could you send me one in a small parcel? I do not know when I shall next be in town or whether I should find any-thing suitable in such a town-cum-village as Minusinsk.
Perhaps I shall also ask Mark (if there is any money) to buy me a good revolver; but so far, I do not see the need for it.
Yours, V.

What news is there of Columbus? * I have heard that he is married and is ill.
Do you know anything about him? Anatoly and Yuly have again been put in prison; they did not want to leave before navigation begins and so the Governor-General ordered them to wait in gaol! The steam-er for Yeniseisk is supposed to leave Krasnoyarsk some time after May 20.

until autumn, for at the moment I am mostly loafing around doing nothing.
I cannot yet say whether I shall need anything else or what it might be.
As for my being “horribly inhospitable”, I shall dispute that with you.
Before one can be hospitable, i.
e.
, receive guests, must one not first know where one is going to live? That is something I did not know when I was in Krasnoyarsk.
The “Shu-shu-shu” that I hear and repeat cannot be called knowledge when I have no idea of how to get to that Shu-shu-shu, of what the place is like or how I shall live there, etc.
And before being hospitable one must know for certain that the guests can reach you and be lodged, I will not say comfortably, but at least reasonably well.
I have not been able to say this until very recently, that is, until the middle of May.
You will most likely read my letter in June.
This means that it will take the better half of the summer to pass on information and make prepa-rations.
Does this make sense? You have, of course, already learnt from my letter describing the journey by road that a trip here is quite a troublesome affair and rather unplea-sant.
It was a good thing that the weather was excellent— but what if there had been rain! The weather here is change-able in the extreme.
Yesterday I went shooting.
In the morning the weather was wonderful and it was hot, a real summer’s day.
In the evening a terribly cold wind sprang up with rain into the bargain.
We came home plast-ered with mud and if we had not had fur coats would have frozen on the way.
The local folk say that such happenings are not infrequent in summer and so they take fur coats with them even in summer when they travel.
* Until I have settled down and looked the place over I ought not to invite people here.
In any case, if ever you do come here, I shall have to send a telegram from Minusinsk in advance to tell you whether steamers are going as far as the town and whether naviga-tion is reliable.
If not, it may happen that the steamer will take you only half way.
The Yenisei forms numerous bars and shallows, so navigation as far as Minusinsk is very * I am thinking of acquiring a half-length sheepskin coat for when I go shooting.
short-lived and you have to “catch” it.
Even now I don’t know for certain whether steamers are going as far as Minu-sinsk—I think they are, because the water is rising very fast.
Incidentally, about telegrams.
Our “ postman ” (the one who serves our volost) is in Minusinsk on Thursdays and Mondays (the days the post arrives in Minusinsk).
If you have to send telegrams, therefore, the best time is on Wed-nesday or Sunday, i.
e.
, so that they arrive in Minusinsk on Thursday or Monday morning.
Then I get them on Tues-day or Friday morning.
Of course they can be sent for delivery by messenger on another day, but that is much more expensive and is only for emergencies.
In general I am very surprised that you are unwilling to go abroad.
Can it possibly be more interesting to stay in some village near Moscow? If you travel to Moscow to take music lessons, can you not also travel to the nearest town from there? Incidentally, I think you will be reading this letter somewhere abroad.
All the best, Yours, V.

2 -3 Printed from the original25 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA May 25, 1897 The day before yesterday I received your letter of May 5, Mother dearest, and am answering by the first post.
I, too, am now wondering how it could have happened that I did not write for a long time at the end of April; I must have missed a day or two because of the fuss and bustle at that time, but after that I wrote very frequently, both before my departure from Krasnoyarsk and on the way here.
From here I have also been writing frequently—every week.
There really is nothing to write more frequently about; by the way, I answer all letters immediately, so I may sometimes have written twice in one week.
I have no information about the health of E.
E.
now—she must be better because no one at Tesinskoye writes anything about it.
She was pretty badly exhausted by the journey, especially the road journey, and was anxious to reach the village and rest.
I really do not remember your letter to her, addressed to me, I may have passed it on and forgotten it.
I simply roared with laughter when I read in your letter that Mitya, “the queer fish”, is not coming here! I wrote that as a joke! * What sense would there be in his trekking a distance of 4,500 versts and losing a month (there and back) on the journey for the sake of the joys of Shu-shu-shu!

what to do in summer because of me and are missing the best time and the best accommodation, etc.
It is a pity that the books were sent so late (if they have been sent—you write that you will be sending them “in a day or two”).
I thought they were already on the way.
I shall now have to find out when they will arrive in Kras-noyarsk.
Probably not before the end of summer! Life here is not bad, I go shooting quite a lot; I have got to know the local sportsmen and go shooting with them.
41 I have begun bathing; up to now I have had to go quite a long way, about two and a half versts, but soon I shall be able to go to a place about a verst and a half away.
Such distances mean nothing to me because, apart from shooting and bathing, I spend a lot of time walking.
I am longing for newspapers; I hope I shall soon be receiving them now that you have sent them.
I have had a letter from Basil in Tesinskoye.
He says it is an awful place, quite bare, neither forest nor river near (there is one two versts away—too far for him!), no shoot-ing and no fishing.
And so, if anyone moves at all, they will have to come here, since there is no point in my going there.

May 25, 1897 Anyuta, I am very sorry to hear that your trip abroad is hanging fire because of me.
I am fixed up here so well (certainly better than any of the other comrades) that there is no need at all for Mother to worry about me, and as far as a summer holiday is concerned I think that she can get a better rest abroad than in this place, since she would have to travel thousands of versts on all kinds of transport.
By the way, I expect all this is superfluous now—meaning the “now” when you will be reading this letter.
At first I couldn’t understand why you wrote in your letter, “I repeat that I do not show him, etc.
” 42 —but then I remembered that I had spoken to you about it, in Moscow or even, I think, in St.
Petersburg.
I had completely forgotten it—there was so much confusion there—otherwise I would not have spoken about it a second time.
I imagine that the editor is up to his ears in work and for that reason does not give any but purely business information.
* In view of this my request for books in payment of fees was probably out of place; how would he find time to bother about such a relatively troublesome business? If you have not yet written to him about this, please don’t write.
The fee I received for the first article will last me about a year, when added to my allowance 43—and the remainder for the next two articles 44 I am thinking of using for journals and books.
(I do not know how much you have already sent me; 30 or 40 rubles would be enough and the rest can go for journals.
) As regards journals, I have already written ** (in any case I am repeating it, although I think that some of them, at least, have been sent here) that you should subscribe to (1) Russkoye Bogatstvo, (2) Russkiye Vedomosti,*** (3) Vestnik Finansov (from the beginning of the year), (4) Soziale Pra-xis, (5) Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik (heraus-gegeben von Braun).
I think I have also written partly about books, especially about Ukazatel fabrik i zavodov, third edition, St.
Petersburg, 1894 (I think it costs 5 rubles) and the book by Chuprov and Posnikov on grain prices.
**** If they have not been sent with the other books (which would be a pity because in that case they will be travelling about three months), then please send them by post as printed matter.
These are the books (and also the * He should send the journal directly to my address; tell him that.

If you arrange it to fit in with my mail days (we shall learn to do that soon), you would have to send them only twice a week.

Yezhegodnik if you managed to find it) that I need more than any others for my work.
Please send me direct any particularly interesting new books, so that I shall get them quicker and shall not lag too far behind.
By the way, if a report of the Free Economic Society’s discussions on grain prices (in connection with the book by Chuprov and Pos-nikov) has been published, send it to me 45.
I am still thinking about the possibility of using a Moscow library; have you managed to do anything about it; i.
e.
, have you managed to join some public library? If it is possible to take out books for two months (as you can in St.
Pe-tersburg at the library of the Free Economic Society) it would not cost very much to send them by post as printed matter (16 kopeks a pound, and you can send 4 pounds for 64 kopeks, and 7 kopeks to register them), so it would pro-bably be more profitable for me to spend money on postage and have a lot of books than to spend much more money on buying a few books.
I imagine that it would be much more conveni-ent for me; the only problem is whether you can get books for such a long period (leaving a deposit, of course) from some good library—the University, * or the library of the Moscow Bar Association (you must get information from there, get their catalogue and find out the terms for the acceptance of new members, etc.
), or some other.
There are probably a number of good libraries in Moscow.
You can even find out about private libraries.
If any of you are staying on in Moscow they can probably find, out about all this.
If you go abroad, write to me and I will send you details of books from there.
Send me more catalogues of all kinds of second-hand books, etc.
(libraries, bookshops).
Yours, V.
U.
* I think it would be easy for Mitya to arrange this either through some law student or by going straight to the professor of political econ-omy and saying that he wishes to work in that field and take books from the central library.
The only thing is that he will have to post-pone it now till autumn.
As far as news from St.
Petersburg is concerned I have almost lost all hope; there is nobody to expect a letter from, I’ve already given up hope of the director.

2 -3 Printed from the original26 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA June 8, alten Styls (June 20) The day before yesterday, Mother dearest, I received a letter from you and Manyasha from Warsaw.
It was only from this letter that I learned that you had put an end to all your doubts and had set out on your journey.
Excellent.
I hope you will make good arrangements and will have a nice rest this summer.
I don’t know why you are afraid you will soon feel Heimweh.
* If your trip is only for the summer? I doubt it.
I shall continue writing as frequently as before and the extra three or four days the post takes, with Moscow at such a considerable distance anyway, will not mean much.
You have, of course, received all my previous letters from Shusha and now know that I am fixed up here quite well.
I have been here exactly a month today and still say the same—I am very satisfied with my board and lodging and have even forgotten about the Mineralwasser ** you mention and hope that I shall soon forget its name.
I am now expecting visitors here—one of the comrades wants to come from Minusinsk and Gleb wants to come here for the shooting.
And so I shall not be bored.
Yuly left on May 27 for Turukhansk from Yeniseisk.
Anatoly stayed there; the doctor who examined him on the instructions of the Governor-General found him weak.

Anyuta, I think I have already written to you about the journals and newspapers.
I am sorry I have not written to Mark.
That oversight will probably cause considerable delay.
Send me more “literary manifestations” of all kinds— at least catalogues and prospectuses to begin with.
The best thing is to write everywhere for them so as to obtain as many as possible.
I should very much like to get the classics of political economy and philosophy in the original.
It would be a good thing to find out the cheapest editions (people edition, ** etc.
), and the prices.
You probably will not find very much except at second-hand booksellers’.
However, I shall wait until I hear how you have fixed yourselves up and then there will be time enough to write.
Gleb sends you his special regards.

They have had a lot of visitors recently, so they had a merry time.

At last you, too, are getting down to the busi-ness of “spoiling paper”—that’s fine.
I hope that the “ter-rible boredom” you complain of will make you write more often—I should be very glad of it.
Moreover we are in rather the same position.
We are both living in villages and quite alone—true, I am a bit further away—and so we must make an effort to correspond more often.
It was news to me that Kokushkino is up for sale, and that Mitya has gone to Kazan to see about it.
46 Has he power of attorney to handle the estate? Write and tell me how the matter is settled.
On the one hand it seems to be a good thing that it will be finished with once and for all, but on the other hand the “finish” is a most unpleasant, troublesome and, most likely, unprofitable one.
I have not only not received the box of books—I did not even know that it had been sent.
Who was it sent to and when? To whom was the carrier’s receipt sent? Write to me about all this.
From Mother’s letter I know that they intended sending it through a carrier’s office.
That means it will take a long time, probably two or three months.
If any new books were bought to be sent with the others, please let me know (if you remember) what they were, because I do not risk ordering any at the moment, thinking they are already on the way.
I have begun receiving Russkiye Vedomosti and read it with a voracity that can be explained only as a reaction to the long absence of newspapers.
Has anything else beenordered? (Russkoye Bogatstvo, Vestnik Finansov—in Ryb-kina’s 47 name; German publications).
I receive the news-papers on the thirteenth day after Wednesday and Saturday.
That means that the post from Moscow here leaves on those days; bear that in mind in case you have to make any cal-culations about sending things.
The day before yesterday I received the report of the Society for the Organisation of Popular Entertainment.
48 Thanks.
I have not yet received a single letter from our people abroad.
On account of their travelling they probably had to wait a long time between my letters and wrote to me less often.
I do not know how to write to them now.
It would hardly be convenient to write to Demo and I have no new address.
The last time I wrote to Mother was a week ago, the same time as I sent you a postcard.
Today I shall not write a spe-cial letter to her, but please send this letter on to her so that she will not worry and will have some news of me.
It would not be a bad thing if Mitya, on his return, were also to take up paper-spoiling.
I have not yet given an answer to his “theoretical ” letter; the fact of the matter was that I was so absent-minded when I was in Moscow that I did not remember anything of what he told me about the ques-tion that interested him.
I could not gain a completely definite impression from his letter—first, because it was too short and, secondly, because I have here no Russian transla-tion of the book he quotes and cannot get the necessary information.

I am thinking more keenly and more often over the idea of arranging for parcels of books to be sent here from some capital-city library; I am at times beginning to think that without that arrangement I shall not be able to carry on literary work here; an outside stimulus is very necessary and I have absolutely nothing of the sort here.

2 -3 Printed from the original28 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA July 19, 1897 Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your letter and Manyasha’s dated the 29th.
Merci for them.
Because of the exceptionally long time our letters take, answers to questions arrive so long after they are asked that many of them turn out to be unnecessary.
In this let-ter, for instance, you are still worrying about money and the bale of books—it is now, of course, a long time since you received my letter explaining all that; I received the money a long time ago, I did not draw it for some time because I did not need it and because nobody came from A.
M.
I still have not received the bale of books; I do not know if it has arrived in Krasnoyarsk (it was expected there at the end of June), and from there it will be brought by some-one coming here whom I expect shortly.
To send it from Krasnoyarsk by post would probably cost quite a lot because the post is not sent by steamer but by rail to Achinsk and from there by road to Minusinsk.
Similarly you also must know by now not only that Mark has received an offer to go to St.
Petersburg, but also what decision he has made; he wrote me that he was awaiting an answer from you from abroad.
I received your letter with details of the Kokushkino business and have already answered it.
Yesterday, too, I received the first letter from Mitya in which he, too, described his trip to Kazan.
As far as hygiene is concerned, I do not think I am any worse off here than you are in Spiez.
49 I also bathe (some-times twice a day) in the Yenisei, take walks * and go shoot-ing.
It is true that there are no decent walks near here, but for shooting we sometimes wander a long way, and there are some nice places.
Yesterday I received news from Tesinskoye about a wed-ding—Basil and A.

Manyasha, You ask me to describe the village of Shu-shu-shu.
.
.
.
Hm! Hm! I think I did describe it to you once.
It is a big vil-lage with several streets, rather muddy, dusty—everything as it should be.
It stands in the steppes—there are no orchards or greenery of any kind.
The village is surrounded by dung, which the people here do not cart to the fields but dump outside the village, so that if you leave the vil-lage you always have to pass through a certain amount of dung.
There is a stream called the Shush right beside the village; now it is very shallow.
At about a verst or a verst and a half from the village (or rather from me—the village is a long one) the Shush joins the Yenisei which breaks up here into a large number of streams with islands between them so that there is no way of reaching the mainstream on foot.
I bathe in the biggest stream, which is now also very shallow.
On the other side (the opposite direction from the River Shush) there is, at a distance of about a verst and a half, what the peasants quite seriously call “the pine grove”; it is really a very poor bit of woodland, in which * I wear a net to protect myself from the swarms of mosquitoes we have here.
And they say this is nothing compared with the north! ** Pyotr Kuzmich Zaporozhets.
—Ed.
most of the trees have been felled so that there is no real shade (but a lot of strawberries!); it bears no resemblance to real Siberian taiga which I have as yet only heard about but have never been in (it is at least some thirty or forty versts from here).
Mountains .
.
.
when I wrote about those mountains I was very inaccurate, for they are about 50 versts from here so that you can only look at them, when they are not hidden by clouds, in exactly the same way as you can see Mont Blanc from Geneva.
Because of this the first (and last) line of my poem contains a sort of poetic hyperbole (the figure is used by poets!), about “Sayan’s foot”.
* I can give only one answer, therefore, to your ques-tion about which mountains I have climbed—the sandhills in the “pine grove”, so called—and in general there is plen-ty of sand about here.
My work is progressing very, very slowly.
** I do not know whether I shall need any extracts from books.
I hope that by autumn I shall make an arrangement with some Moscow or St.
Petersburg library.
I read with pleasure your description of life abroad and, your impressions from there.
I should be glad if you would write to me more often.
Your plan to send “a pood of cherries” here, over a dis-tance of six thousand versts and a bit, made me open my mouth in amazement (not from a desire to gorge myself on cherries—there aren’t any here but there will be water melons) at the richness of your imagination.
What are our chemists, compared with this! Yours, V.

29 TO HIS MOTHER August 17 The day before yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your letter of July 29 (August 10) and also a letter from Manyasha.
I am surprised that you are always saying that I do not write often; for a long time, as far as I remember, I have been writing every week and sometimes twice a week— with every post, that is.
I am also beginning to wonder about the box of books; since I received information from Krasnoyarsk at the end of June that the books should arrive about that time and that a further 9 rubles would have to be paid on them, I have heard nothing more, although I immediately (July 1) sent two letters to Krasnoyarsk about the books, one of them with money.
* An acquaintance who had promised to see about my books has turned out to be irresponsible in the extreme and does not even answer my letters.
** I have written a postcard with a pre-paid answer to Popova, per-haps she will reply.
It is a most annoying business! The worst of it is that they do not even write, do not inform me of the state of affairs! Has the carrier’s office been holding it up? The scoundrels probably do not even guarantee to deliver goods in time, nor accept responsibility for delays, do they? Anyuta also writes about the loss of your letters (by the way, I have received Gumplowicz and Archiv from * The letters have been lost.

—Ed.
her—my thanks for the two books).
I do not know which letters have been lost, I always acknowledge those I receive.
One letter was lying about for some two months in Minusinsk, as I wrote before.
I then wrote a complaint to the Minusinsk post office and enclosed the envelope of that letter as documentary evidence.
* If registered letters or packages by book post are lost, you must keep the receipts and absolutely must demand compensation; that is the only way to teach these Siberian Ivan Andreiches 51 to be careful.
There is nothing I can write about myself.
The letters are short because life is very monotonous; I have already described the appearance of things from the outside; inward-ly day differs from day only because today you are reading one book, tomorrow you will read another; today you take a walk to the right of the village, tomorrow to the left; today you write one article, tomorrow another (I have now been distracted from my main work by writing an article 52 ).
I am perfectly well, of course, go shooting now and again.
The weather is nasty—wind, cold, autumn rain, so I stay at home most of the time.
Probably there will be some fine days in September.
I intend going to Minusinsk to buy myself a few things—a lamp, some things for the winter, etc.
I am thinking of going with Prominsky.
Thank Manyasha for her letter.
She wrote asking me what I should like from abroad; Mitya, she says, wants a steel watch.
.
.
.
Hm! Hm I have a watch and it still keeps time, but an alarm clock would be (or, rather, might be) very useful because here I sleep far too much and have probably not only made up for the sleep I lost in the remand prison but have badly overdone it.
.
.
.
Only how will you send it here?.
.

Unless you wait till someone comes.

It is quite clear that Anyuta, as long as she lives in the country, cannot fulfil my requests for books.
If she should chance to be in Berlin or Leipzig on the way back, then perhaps she will be able to.
I have already written that the writer has agreed to my request to send me books, and that * The letter has been lost.

I am very glad that you have begun to enjoy being abroad.
What are your plans for the winter? You are probably busy now searching for an apartment.
The problem of finding accommodation in a big city is a difficult and tedious bu-siness! You are probably running around searching, if Mark and Mitya have not yet found anything for you.
Mother’s letter, in which she spoke about her petition, I received and answered immediately.
55 The efforts made by Gleb and Basil to get transferred to Minusinsk have not come to anything although they were very energetic about it.
56 I am not trying to get a transfer and so far do not intend to; I have no complaints to make about Shu-shu-shu and I do not like that state of uncertainty when you start making applications, get excited waiting for a reply, keep getting ready to leave and so on.
Well, all the best.
I have not written much because today I am late with the despatch of my article and am in a great hurry.

2 -3 Printed from the original31 TO HIS MOTHER September 30 I am writing to you from Tesinskoye, Mother dearest, as I promised.
I arrived here yesterday evening.
It took us a long time to get here because there were three of us (Basil, I and a boy I took with me) with our luggage on a one-horse cart, and the horse a lazy one at that.
The Tes people * are well fixed up.
They have an excel-lent flat in a big two-storey house (in Shusha there are no such houses), the best in the village.
They have the entire top floor, four good rooms with a kitchen and an entrance hall.
The rooms are big, light, and clean with high ceil-ings and the furniture is good—in short, an excellent apart-ment for six rubles a month.
Gleb now has a job of some sort.
Thanks to this they have been able to manage and the financial crisis is over—there was, however, a time when things were tight.
A.
M.
has taken a job as a nurse in the village of Sagaiskoye, several dozen versts from here in the same district.
She will probably not keep the job for long because her health will certainly not permit her to continue such work and she is expected to return in a month.
Gleb does not look too well, he is always poorly and gets irrit-able.
Basil is flourishing.
E.
E.
feels quite at home in the family and is doing all the household chores; she had a hard time in the summer and even now it is not easy for her, as she has to do all the work herself.
It is impossible to find servants here.
In summer you cannot get anyone, even tem-* G.

porarily.
At the moment there is a woman who comes in and helps with the work.
We all went shooting together today.
The weather is excellent and we are enjoying ourselves.
I have permission for five days and will leave on Friday or Saturday—straight back to Shusha, about 70 versts from here.
I received a letter from Mark quite a while ago (dated September 12).
I am awaiting news of how he finished up his “liquidator’s trip” to Kazan.
He wrote to me, among other things, about a dog.
In Shusha I have a mongrel pup and hope to have it as a gun dog next year.
It would cost a mint of money to bring a dog here from Russia.
He also asks about my book—it is still frozen.
When I get back to Shu-sha I hope to get down to work more seriously and will then write in greater detail.
Kisses for you and Manyasha.
Yours, V.
U.
Everybody here also says that I have put on a lot of weight this summer, am sunburned and look like a real Siberian.
That is what shooting and village life do for you! All the Petersburg ailments have been shaken off! All the people in Tes send you, it goes without saying, lots of greetings.
Written September 3 0 , 1 8 9 7 Sent from Tesinskoye to Moscow First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original32 TO HIS MOTHER October 12, 1897 On the 7th, Mother dearest, I received a letter from you and Mitya dated September 20.
I was in a great hurry last time and, as I remember, did not write much.
Today I must make up for it.
Thanks to Mitya for his letter.
In answer to his ques-tions—I am receiving Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii for 1897 and have also received one issue for 1896 and will send it when I have read it (for the time being I have given it to the people at Tesinskoye).
I still go shooting.
The shooting is not as successful as it was (shooting hares, grouse and partridge is new to me and I shall have to get used to it), but it is no less pleasant.
Whenever there is a fine autumn day (and this year there have been many of them) I take my gun and wander off across the fields and forest.
Usually I go with Prominsky; I take my landlord’s dog, which I have trained to follow me, and which has some (although not much) skill as a gun dog.
I have acquired a dog for myself—I got a pup from an acquaintance here and hope that I shall be able to train it by next summer; I don’t know whether it will turn out a good dog and whether it will have any hunting sense.
I don’t know how to spot that kind of thing, and no very definite opinion of the qualities of my Pega-sus can be had from his pedigree.
The quilted jackets we all had bought for us in St.
Petersburg are very convenient for shooting and I can never praise mine enough.
In general, as far as my winter clothes and other things (which you ask about) are concerned, I have ample.
I have alreadybought many winter things in Minusinsk and will buy some more.
In general, shopping in Minusinsk is difficult; there is practically no choice, the shops are the village type of general store (all sorts of odds and ends; goods are deliv-ered periodically and I got there at a time when the old stock had run out and the new had not arrived) and it is difficult for one accustomed to city shops to find anything in them.
Incidentally, it is high time I got rid of these big-city habits; they are of no use here and I must get used to local ways.
I seem to be fairly well acclimatised, but as far as shopping is concerned I still think in the St.
Peters-burg way—you have only to go into a shop and get what you want.
.
.
.
I will tell you about my journey in greater detail.
I was in Minusinsk for two days only and all the time went in running round the shops, in seeing about Basil’s case (we wrote a complaint together about the magistrate’s sentence and the magistrate himself admitted that it was too severe.
57 We’ll see what the higher court has to say) and in visiting acquaintances.
There are now many political exiles in Mi-nusinsk—A.
V.
Tyrkov (the March 1, 1881 case), N.
S.
Tyut-chev and Y.
K.
Yakovlev (Narodnoye Pravo group), S.
I.
Melnikov (Narodnaya Volya Party), Blazejewski (Polish worker), S.
G.
Raichin (my closest acquaintance and a man of the same views), F.
Y.
Kon (Polish intellec-tual who has served a sentence of penal servitude), and Stoyanovsky (arrested in connection with the Ginsburg case and has served a sentence of penal servitude).
I saw almost all of them.
I think I shall be able to go there again in win-ter.
Such temporary visits are probably better than living in Minusinsk, which does not attract me.
Its only advan-tage is the post (this advantage is even greater in Achinsk, so I would naturally “prefer ” Achinsk).
But this is only by the way, for I have settled down completely in Shu-shenskoye and have got used to the idea of wintering here and am not applying for a transfer and advise you not to.
I went to Tesinskoye with Basil.
We had a good time there and I was very pleased to see the comrades and to have company after my Shushenskoye solitude.
That company, however, seems to be worse off than I am.
Not as far as lodgings, etc.
, are concerned, in that respect they are better off, but they are not adjusted.
Gleb is often quite ill, is often despondent; Basil, too, it seems, is not so “flour-ishing” after all, though he is the most balanced of the Tes crowd.
E.
E.
does the housekeeping, enjoys life at Tesin-skoye, but is also often ill.
Keeping house is not easy for her since there are no servants; it is extremely difficult to find a servant in the Siberian villages—in summer it is absolutely impossible.
You can live well if you are fixed up as I am with full board and lodging, but keeping house yourself is very difficult.
The Tes people live much more “sociably” (so to speak) than I do; they are acquainted with the district nurse in Tesinskoye and not far from them (about 15 versts) there are some former women students whom they see quite often.
58 I have not lost hope that their despondency will pass.
Gleb and Basil now have jobs 59 ; they could not live without work, for the allowance they receive is only 24 rubles (the authorities won’t give Basil an allowance for his wife because he got married while in exile).
Again about the library.
Which library did Mitya get the Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii from? If he got them from the Petrovskaya library, can he get their catalogue (a new one)? I think they lend books for an indefinite period.
Yours, V.
U.
I am perfectly well, of course; I am working, I feel fine.

Printed from the original33 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA October 19, 1897 I received Manyasha’s letter of September 29th, Mother dearest, on October 14; it told me about the delay of my letters to Mark.
* I must admit I was afraid of this before, when I knew that Mark was leaving.
The delay, however, was not very great, so small, in fact, that the manuscript I sent reached its destination in time.
60 I am still living as usual, in peace and quietness.
The weather is getting wintry, we have long since sealed our-selves up behind double windows, keep the stove going, etc.
The real cold is still to come, of course, and so far there have been mostly autumn days when it is pleasant to stroll through the forest with a gun.
I shall probably continue that exercise through the winter.
Shooting in winter, going after hares, for instance, is no less interesting than it is in summer, and I regard it as one of the important advantages of rural life.
I usually get the magazines in the first half of the month.
I am now reading the September issues with interest.
Soon I hope to get some information from the editors about the article I sent.
If it is accepted I shall subscribe to a few more magazines-I think I had better do it through the same editorial office, so that there is no more muddle and I don’t get the same copies twice.
I am awaiting news of the arrival of Anyuta, Mark and Mitya.

61 Manyasha, Merci for the letter.

I do not know the reason for the delay.
If you happen to be near the shop in which you ordered them, look in and hurry them up.

If you are interested in this publication, subscribe to it in your own name and send it on to me afterwards.
Its programme is so extensive and the price so low that one cannot help thinking there may be some catch in it.
We’ll see.
I recall that either Anyuta or you wrote to me about having sent the second issue of Mehring.
I have not received it.
It is quite possible that the first got through by chance.

I have received a letter from Gleb in which he says he has submitted an application for permission to come to me for ten days during the holidays.
I hope lie will get permission.
It will give me great pleasure.
They have written from Tesinskoye that Zinaida Pavlovna has been sentenced to three years’ exile in northern guber-nias, and that she is asking to be sent to Minusinsk Dis-trict.
* I believe Nadezhda Konstantinovna ** intends to do the same, although her sentence is not yet properly known; it will probably be very much the same.

that you ought to translate it.
(The original is in Italian and Kamensky in Novoye Slovo says that the French trans-lation is not very good.
You would, of course, have to get the original.
) The book is in three parts: (1) In Memory of the Communist Manifesto, (2) Historical Materialism (the biggest part) and (3) Appendix: The Manifesto of the Communist Party (translated into French by Laura Lafar-gue).
It goes without saying that only the second part is suitable for translation, and not all of that (I have not yet finished reading it).
If something is left out, it will not by any means detract from this extremely clever defence of “our doctrine” (Labriola’s expression).
I am writing to St.
Petersburg this very day to find out whether the writer proposes using this material for the journal.
You can either get his opinion from N.
K.
(I am writing to her) or propose directly to him that you start the translation.

U.
Manyasha, I received your letter of November 24 and the second issue of the Vyatka Returns.
Earlier I received the Ulo-zheniye and Ustav64—I do not remember whether I acknowl-edged them.
You say that “goods for Minusinsk are still not being accepted from Moscow”.
Perhaps they will soon be accept-ed.
Mark could probably find out.
Books are no longer urgent.
Perhaps you can send them with someone coming at Christmas or with the girls * who intend to come here (I am writing to Mother about them) or, eventually, with someone else.
If things are sent to Krasnoyarsk the delay is, in any case, tremendous.
If any book is needed for work, I shall write and it can be sent by post.
We had better wait a while before using the carrier’s office.
Savchenko’s book, it seems, is Peskovsky’s.
Programma domashnego chteniya has arrived; I have looked at it, it is dull and I do not want to write a review.
* The girls are Nadezhda Krupskaya and Zinaida Nevzorova.

Wolfe’s little publication starts quite well and is fabu-lously cheap.
I have ordered Seignobos.
I do not intend to order Ziber yet.
If I get some money I shall probably order it, too.
Kalmykova’s bookshop gives me a discount of 15 per cent, so I order books from there; it is convenient, too, because it saves you trouble.

2 -3 Printed from the original35 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTERS MARIA AND ANNA December 21, 1897 I received your letter of December 5 the day before yesterday, Mother dearest.
I am very, very glad that there is a hope of Mitya’s business being cleared up.
In any case it is obvious that it is mainly a misunderstanding and that there can be no question of anything serious.
You ask me whether I received a package sent on November 16—what package do you mean? If, in general, it is possible to send things to Minusinsk you should address them to me direct, because my letters go through Minusinsk Post Office any-way and I have given our postman power of attorney to collect my mail.
I seem to have got mixed up over all these packages you have sent or intended to send me.
Have you sent anything to Popova in Krasnoyarsk? I think not, but just in case I will ask an acquaintance who is going there soon (from Minusinsk) to make enquiries.
* I am in no hurry for books.
I now have so many that I cannot manage them all, let alone more.

Merci for them.

soon, not later than a week from now (I am afraid our post-man will not go for the mail at all on Wednesday 24th).
These first two volumes proved to be without interest.
Such things are, of course, inevitable when you order books you know nothing about, and I was prepared for it before-hand.
I hope at least that we shall not have to pay any fine— they will extend them for another month.
I did not understand your sentence “To get into the jurists’ library—I asked Kablukov about it—you must be a jurist and submit two recommendations from members of the Society of Jurists”.
Is that all? You do not have to be a member of the society yourself? I shall try to get a recom-mendation through St.
Petersburg.
I know for a fact that one does not have to be a jurist to join the society.
All the best, V.
U.
Anyuta, Merci for your letter of December 5 and for the list.
It is a pity you took so much trouble copying it a second time.
I seem to have expressed myself badly about the accounts; it stands to reason that it is of interest to me to know results—plus or minus so much—and not those details that caused you so much trouble and nevertheless mean noth-ing to me.
* It is strange that they do not send me any accounts from the office of the journal.
I am shortly sending something else 65 there.
I shall have to put a note in with it (when I send the manuscript) asking them to send an account of the fees and expenditure on the journals, etc.
It seems that I have overstepped the mark through not knowing exactly how much I own.
It seems that there was some misunderstanding between us about my question concerning how the project for the * This apparently work.

It stands to reason that what I said about my first assumption does not hold now that the opposite has been proved.
Oh, that Yegor! I’ll give him what for.
The photos, including the group, have still not arrived.
67 I have written to Nadezhda Konstantinovna but have not received a reply.
Should I write to Yuly’s sisters? By the way, I received a letter from Yuly dated October 29 (sic!).
He writes that he lives reasonably well, they have all moved into one house (this is much more conve-nient and cheaper and the meals are more easily arranged at the expense of their one and only “lady”), they have received their allowances so he is looking and feeling bet-ter and is not a bit despondent.
Our poet friend * should be coming to me soon for the holidays, if he does not let me down again.
Anatoly is still worried about his wife who has been locked up in Yeniseisk (for three months), the cells are cold and she has been taken ill.
68 A bad business! It would have been far better for her to have done her term in Russia! Fedoseyev and Lyakhovsky have not written a word.

Printed from the original36 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA December 27, 1897 The money has arrived, Mother dearest, both the first and the second lots (i.
e.
, of November 16 and December 8).
We are now receiving our allowance regularly, too, so that in this respect things have returned to normal and I think for a long (relatively long) time no emergency additions will be necessary.
Gleb has now been living with me for several days, having obtained permission for a ten-day trip here.
We are having an excellent time and do a lot of walking because the weath-er is mostly very warm.
Ever since one day, when the frost was said to be 36° R (about ten days ago) and after a few days of snowstorm (“of weather”, as the people here say), the days have been very warm and we go shooting very zealously but without much luck.
What shooting is there to be had here in winter! The walks are pleasant, though.
Because of the holidays there was no outgoing mail on Wednesday this week and no incoming mail on Friday; this is the third time since I have been living in Shusha that the mail has missed a turn—that is not very often.
Thanks to my guest, I scarcely notice it.
Many kisses, Yours, V.
U.
I am sending an article of mine for the journal.
It would be good if you could pass it on quickly; perhaps you will be in time for the January issue.
69 Gleb sends his regards.
He asks you to tell Manyasha that he expects he will have a lot to argue about with her.
Manyasha, Do not work so hard, Manyasha, over Stange; it is quite probable that I was mistaken.
How could I remember after so many years! You have found one article so we may con-sider ourselves lucky.
It has even occurred to me that the second was not in Ekonomichesky Zhurnal but in Severny Vestnik for 1891 (at least I recently came across a reference to that effect somewhere).
In any case there is no need to go through Ekonomichesky Zhurnal up to 1895.
As far as concerns your visit to me—I shall be very glad.
Things are different now and I have no particular reasons for objecting.
If you wait for a steamer up the Yenisei you can travel without any particular discomfort.
It is quite possible that Nadezhda Konstantinovna will also come to me; the matter will probably be settled soon, and may even have been settled by the time you are reading this letter.
If she is allowed to choose Shu-shu-shu as her place of exile instead of the north of Russia, she will not, of course, be allowed to put it off until spring but will have to travel at once.
Best wishes, V.

I recall that Mark once wrote to me asking if he should get a gun dog for me in Moscow.
My attitude at the time was very cool since I counted on my Pegasus, but he has let me down badly.
I would now be in hearty agreement with such a plan, of course, but as far as I can see, it is purely Utopian and would not be worth the trouble.
The transport is very expensive.
Gleb gets fantastic ideas—why not take a little pup and bring it in a basket! We had a good laugh over that plan, which is, of course, little better than any other.
It was simply that Mark let his imagination run away with him; from this postscript you can see what petty problems sometimes engage the attention of the inhabitants of Shu-shu-shu and Te-te-tes.

One mail delivery was missed this week (January 1), so I do not know the outcome of Anyuta’s efforts.
70 It is probable, however, that the outcome is favourable because if the case has already gone to St.
Petersburg it means that it is a petty one and there is no reason for any great delay.
* You need have no fears about my big coat.
With my winter suit (which we all brought with us from St.
Peters-burg) it is quite enough even for travelling (and I very rarely have to travel).
For walking it is too warm and I wear a quilted jacket—there have been a couple of cold days (yes-terday and the day before) but they are the exception.
Altogether, the winter here is exceptionally warm.
Nor is there any need to be afraid of my going shooting; there is no danger.
Now, by the way, there will be an end to all shooting, probably until spring.

There was a real holiday this year in Shu-shu-shu and the ten days passed unnoticed.
Gleb liked the place and said that it is much better than Tesinskoye (I said the same thing about Tes! I made fun of Gleb by saying that anywhere is better than where we are), that there is forest near here (in which it is good to walk in winter) and an excellent view of the distant Sayan Mountains.
He was * See Letter No.
34.
—Ed.
enthusiastic about the Sayans, especially on a clear day when the sun is on them.
Gleb, by the way, has become very fond of singing, so my silent rooms grew merry during his stay and fell quiet again after he left.
But he has no music and no songs.
I think we had a lot of that rubbish (from the times when we also used to “bawl”).
If nobody needs them any longer it would be a good idea to send them to him; he would be very glad.
Basil is the musician (on the guitar) and would rearrange them for him.
Gleb’s health improved somewhat during his stay with me due to the regular life and plenty of walking; he was much livelier when he left.
I think I have already written that Nadezhda Konstan-tinovna intended asking to be sent here (she was sentenced to three years in the northern gubernias).
If that plan is carried out it will afford a good opportunity for books, music and everything.
Kisses, Yours, V.
U.
January 4, 1898 Mark, I have received your letter of December 16 in which two interesting announcements with theses were enclosed.
I must admit that the prohibition of the lectures by Tugan-Bara-novsky and Struve did not very greatly surprise me since the latter’s article on the same subject was cut out and the theses were perfectly clear.
I did not understand, however, which minister banned the lectures.
But, of course, it does not take the St.
Petersburg government departments long to get in touch with each other 71 .
.
.
.
I was very surprised to learn that the Chicagoan is in St.
Petersburg.
The last time I heard of him it was said (or rather, written) that he was somewhere in the Cau-casus.
So he has a job now.
He does not answer my letter and I suppose I shall have to stop expecting him to; he is probably very busy now at his job, and with his perpetual journeyings could have forgotten it a dozen times over.
I’ll manage without him.
How did you find him? Howis he looking (not in the physical sense) and what does he plan to do? What contacts has he made and is he think-ing of resuming his attempts at literary work? (Perhaps Anyuta will write and give me answers to some of these questions, as many [answers, that is] as she can, so I am probably wasting your time asking you.
) By the way, have you written to him about my last request (I wrote to Manyasha about it)—to inform H.
Braun about permission for a translation? * The lecture (Lozinsky’s) is really a masterpiece of fool-ishness.
72 If P.
B.
does not write about it in the home news,73 send me the issue of Trudy Volno-ekonomicheskogo obsh-chestva containing it—if it is easy to find.
He should be put in his place beside Mr.
Yuzhakov.
If you send the lecture buy me at the same time the verbatim report of the discussion in the Free Economic Society, 1896, on the cur-rency reform.
Some Narodnik, it might even have been Lozinsky, also distinguished himself on that occasion.
] What have you heard about Syn Otechestva? 7 4 I wrote to St.
Petersburg that they should subscribe to it for me if it is worth the trouble.
** It is interesting because of the Narodniks on its staff.
Do you ever see that sheet? All the best, V.
U.
P.
S.
I have a gun dog again, a setter.
A friend brought it from town.
We’ll see how it turns out, whether it will live till spring (it is still very young and I am again afraid it will get distemper).
It has one disadvantage—it is of the female estate.

38 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA January 24, 1898 I have received letters from Manyasha and Anyuta and also two books—Semyonov (Vol.
III) and Yuridichesky Vest-nik.
Many thanks to Manyasha for the latter.
I have also received Basil’s photograph Please buy me the books—Kablukov, Lektsii po ekonomii selskogo khozyaistva, and V.
V.
, Ocherki kustarnoi promysh-lennosti (1 ruble 50).
The latter may perhaps be found second-hand; the former was recently issued for students and Manyasha can probably get it for me even if it is not on sale (as is possible, judging from the absence of adver-tisements in Russkiye Vedomosti).
I have nothing new to say about myself.
It is pleasanter now three of us go shooting together—we are having real spring weather; it is even thawing today.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna has been given reason to hope that her three years’ exile in Ufa Gubernia will be changed to two years in Shusha 75 and I am expecting her and Yeli-zaveta Vasilyevna.
76 I am even getting lodgings ready— the next room in the same house.
* If other guests come in summer we can take the whole house (the owners will move into the old log cabin in the yard), which would be much more convenient than our setting up house here ourselves.
* An amusing competition is going on between us and the local parson, who is also asking our landlady for a room.
I am protesting and insist that she wait until my “family” affairs have been finally settled.
I still do not know whether I shall be able to get rid of my rival.
What I do not know is whether N.
K.
’s case will be settled by spring; it is said that we shall get an answer in February, but so far that is only a rumour.
It is most annoying that Mitya’s case is dragging on so long; it will be unpleasant for him if he has to lose a year.
Still, he will probably be allowed to enter another univer-sity or to take his examinations as an external student.
* Yours, V.
U.
I am enclosing a letter to Columbus.
** Anyuta, I have read in the newspapers about the publication of your translation of de Amicis’s book.
If you have any spare copies please send me some.
On what terms did you do the translation? Was there a contract with the publisher, and what sort? My head is now fall of plans to issue my articles as a separate book.
77 A few days ago I received N.
Vodovozov’s Ekonomicheskiye etyudy, and that gave me the idea.
It would be very inconvenient to publish the article about the handi-craftsmen as a separate pamphlet.
It would be far better to print it together with the Sismondi article.
It could then be published without preliminary censorship (10 printer’s signatures are needed for that and these articles will make about 12—about 200 pages, that is), which is much more convenient.
It could be given the title of An Assessment of the Romantic Doctrines of Narodism.
Such a book would be more interesting and varied.
The main question, in my opinion, is whether the censors will permit the reprinting of an article from a suppressed journal.
I should imagine they will permit it, as it is an abstract article and was published a long time ago, long before the journal was suppressed.
I am also writing to N.
K.
about this—she should ask the writer’s opinion.
I do not want to wait until their new plans are put into effect.
The articles are actually not very suitable for a journal, as they * See Letter No.
34.
—Ed.
** The letter has been lost.
—Ed.
are too long.
Let the other articles that I think it would be dangerous to include in the book (they would not be allowed) and not very suitable (they are of a different character) go for the journal.
The article about handicraftsmen is quite mild and full of figures.
As far as the financial side of the business is concerned I think it is much more favourable than the censorship side of it.
Assuming that the price is a ruble fifty kopeks and only a thousand printed * we can allow 500 rubles for the publication and the same sum each for the booksellers and the author.
The sale of 500 copies would cover costs, and that number is certain to be sold.
The question is who will undertake the publication.
There is no one to be relied on in St.
Petersburg.
Would not Mark undertake the publishing job (buying paper, contract with the printer) and Manyasha the proofreading? ** If that plan can be put into effect I will immediately send corrections to the article on Sismondi (it must be broken up into §§ and some important misprints need correcting).
If you agree, telegraph me “send corrections”.
I calculate that the book could come out in April, if not sooner.
It seems to me we should try ourselves and not wait for the plans of the Novoye Slovo people, who move at a snail’s pace.
And, besides, it is a pity for me to write for nothing— I must earn something, too.
The objection may be raised that the articles are quite different in character, but I do not think there is anything wrong in that; Vodovozov’s are also different in character, and, in general, such collec-tions of articles are published.
There is, moreover, something common to them both; they are a criticism of Narodnik economics—one is abstract and the other uses Russian data.
Please answer me as quickly as possible about this—can the plan be carried out or not? If it can, we must start on it without losing time.

Sent from Shushenskoye to Moscow First published in 1 9 2 9 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.
4 Printed from the original39 TO HIS MOTHER February 7, 1898 Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received letters from you and from all the family dated January 22 and 23 and was very glad to get them; I send you my thanks for all the good wishes.
I guessed, of course, that you would write to Nadezhda Konstantinovna and invite her to visit you; it is to be hoped she will be allowed to.
I still know nothing about her transfer to Shu-shu; she keeps writing that it will be settled “in a day or two”, but it is still dragging on.
Now, however, we probably shall not have to wait long for a final decision.
As to what you should send with N.
K.
—I think you should give her a real load of books since we do not know whether there will be an opportunity in summer.
Manyasha intends going abroad (and that, of course, is a bit more interesting than Shu-shu and the Siberian mosquitoes), and you will prob-ably go off to Kokushkino with Mitya.
.
.
.
It’s bad that in two and a half months he has already begun to look puffy.
First—does he stick to a diet in prison? I suppose not.
In my opinion that is essential.
Second—does he do physical jerks? Probably not, either.
Also essential.
I can at least say from my own experience that every day, with great pleas-ure and profit I did my gymnastics before going to bed.
You loosen up so well at times that it makes you warm even in the worst cold, when the cell is like an ice-well, and after it you sleep better.
I can recommend to him an exercise that is very convenient (even if funny)—bow to the ground 50 times.
I set myself that stint and was not embarrassed when the warder watched me through the peephole and wasamazed that a prisoner who had never expressed a desire to attend the prison church should suddenly have become so pious! He must bow not less than fifty times without bending his legs and must touch the floor with his fingers each time.
Tell him that.
Most of these doctors, you know, only talk about hygiene.
I have already written something about clothes.
I do not need any underclothes except socks.
As for the local tailors, I do not place much hope in them.
It is very incon-venient to get clothes made in Minusinsk; one has to go there.
There is a tailor here who makes clothes for every-body (he told me so today), including former political exiles, even for all the priests (he boasted to me of that).
Although it all sounds very impressive, you had better buy ready-made clothes in Moscow and give the material you have to Mitya or Mark.
One thing I do ask you for in par-ticular—a pair of moleskins, because I tear my clothes terribly when I am out shooting.
If my straw hat is still in good shape (it’s a Paris hat, after all, the devil take it!) she should bring it.
Prominsky, as a matter of fact, has begun making hats (sometimes they look like felt boots!) but they are suitable only for spring and autumn and not for summer.
The only other thing is—kid gloves, if they can be bought without knowing the size (which I doubt).
I have never worn them, either in St.
Petersburg or Paris, but I want to try them in Shu-shu-shu in summer as a pro-tection against mosquitoes.
I can wear a net over my head but my hands get badly bitten.
Gleb assures me that the local mosquitoes bite through gloves but I do not believe him.
The gloves have to be suitably chosen, of course, not for dances but for mosquitoes.
Then I need some paper, ruled in squares; I do not suppose there is any in Minusinsk—any-way I do not need much, about four quires with squares of different sizes from the smallest to the largest.
Anyuta asks when the wedding is to be and who we are “inviting”! Isn’t she in a hurry! First of all Nadezhda Kon-stantinovna has to get here, and then we have to get permis-sion from the authorities to marry—we are people with-out any rights at all.
So how can I do any “inviting”? As far as concerns verbalisme and phraséologie it seems to me that they should be translated as verbalism (with anexplanation) and phraseology.
.
.
.
That, of course, is not really translation but simply transcription, but what else can you do? “Dilettantism ” is quite wrong for verbalism— almost the opposite, in fact.
Verbalism is probably closer to scholasticism, i.
e.
, to superfluous (pseudo) learnedness, than to dilettantism.
But I don’t remember exactly how Labriola uses these words.
Merci for Bogdanov.
I have read half of it.
Very interest-ing and to the point.
I am thinking of writing a review.
79 In reply to Manyasha’s questions: what sort of voice has Gleb? Hm, hm! I suppose it must be baritone.
He sings the things that Mark and I used to “bawl” (as Nanny 80 used to say).
The next question—will Paris go to her head? Very like-ly.
She has now seen for herself what it is like abroad and can judge.
I lived only one month in Paris, did very little work and spent most of the time running round to see the “sights”.
It is not clear to me either whether Manyasha wants to go to study or for the summer only.
Thanks to Mark for his letter.
He must not, however, forget Gogol’s “Ivan Andreiches”.
81 I do not know what progress has been made in Russia, but here in Siberia they are doubtlessly flourishing, and they are interested in other things besides knowing whether a government official is arriving and whether the young ladies are on the way.
I am surprised that you have not even heard about Syn Otechestva.
I saw in Russkaya Mysl 82 today (the issue of November or December 1897) that the newspaper declares itself a Narodnik organ pur sang.

U.
The real cold has now arrived, so we have given up shoot-ing and only go for walks—in the forest, though.
My lodg-ings are warm, however, and my clothes still warmer.

Petersburg, if, of course, it is not too late by now.

She asks whether I received a registered package sent by Anna on December 27.
* It is difficult for me to remember now because it was a long time ago.
I remember that I received some foreign catalogues and Neue Zeit.
84 Manyasha’s letter is dated January 26, so it is quite possible that my answer to the letter of December 27 had not reached Moscow by then.
** I received Bogdanov’s book before that; I liked it very much and have written a review.
*** Bulgakov’s book is not too bad, either, but I do not like the chapter on turnover and his formulation of the question of the foreign market is not quite correct.
I was, of course, very pleased to receive it.
Again our allowance is being delayed—owing to the new year.
Another piece of news—a new chief of police has arrived from Yeniseisk (it is the one who wanted to take the shotguns away).
85 He does not seem to have done any-thing to distinguish himself yet.
For some unknown reason Prominsky has had his allowance reduced from 31 rubles a month (he has five children) to 21 rubles—seven people cannot live on that sum in Shusha and his hatter’s business (that is his trade) is not a going concern here.

Did you send N.

money to subscribe to Vestnik Finan-sov? I did not expect it at all (because I asked her to sub-scribe only in the event of my finances being in a brilliant state) and now I get it from her as I always did.
Today I am sending Anyuta the books from the library and the technical reports by registered post.
Mark, Nadezhda Konstantinovna writes that the writer has proposed either to look for money for the publication of my articles or a publisher for them, and for this reason she will not take the manuscripts away from him.
I answered that she should take them and send them to you because one can “look” for many years, and, indeed, who would willingly go to so much trouble.
I shall start on the corrections to Sismondi in a couple of days without waiting for your answer to one of my earlier letters and as soon as they are finished I shall send them to you.
86 (The writer’s proposal is impor-tant to me only because it shows the feasibility of this enterprise from the standpoint of censorship, which is actually the only thing that interested me.
) As regards my other manuscripts, with the exception of the article on handi-craftsmen, ** 87 do not think they should be included, first, because they are of a different character, suitable only for a journal, the subjects are polemical and of temporary interest, and, secondly, because it is not worth the risk.

** That is, the articles on the “heritage” and on Yuzhakov.

88When you receive this letter you should be able, I think, to begin negotiations with the printers (in the plural, because you will probably have to seek and haggle) and look for a shop in which to buy paper.
While these preliminary searches are going on I shall send the corrections, and you will then be able to go straight on with the printing.
It seems to me important not to waste time, so that the book can come out in April.
All the best, V.

I think the article on Sismondi had better go first, followed by the handicrafts.

4 Printed from the original41 TO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW February 18, 1898 Today I am sending you, Mark, the corrections to the Sismondi article by registered post.
There were fewer cor-rections than I expected—only the misprints and the division of the article into chapters (two) and paragraphs.
It is to be expected that the compositors will find it much easier to work from a printed text, so there will be fewer mistakes and less proof-reading to do (but the proofs abso-lutely must be read).
The magazine pages I am sending can go straight to the printers, but give them strict warn-ing not to lose them * (they usually do lose manuscripts) and that each time they should send the original (manu-script or magazine page) together with the proofs; without this it is terribly difficult for a stranger (not the author) to correct them (I know this from my own experience) and there will be many unpleasant misunderstandings and mis-takes.
I hope Manyasha will find time to undertake the proof-reading.
In general, it is very important for the proofs to be read by one person from beginning to end, otherwise there will be a muddle because of the signs the proof-readers use, and, furthermore, they usually forget, when subse-quent proofs are received (there must be at least two), to verify whether the mistakes indicated in the first proofs have been corrected and whether fresh mistakes were not made in correcting the old ones.
Accurate printing and an elegant edition are very important.
* If it has to be torn up into separate pages (printers usually do that), number them all with special numbers to prevent losses.
The article (together with this letter) will arrive at the very beginning of March and if you set about the printing immediately and carry it out without delay, and if you hurry the printer, you may manage to finish it and present it to the censor by Easter.
That would be very good; the sale of the book will probably be much slower if it does not come out until May.
I am awaiting news from you on the way things are going.
I have been thinking a lot about the other two articles (on the “heritage” and on Yuzhakov); on the one hand, caution tells me that they should not be printed, but, on the other hand, it is a pity to abandon them, especially the second.
.
.
.
The fact is that it analyses a book and not a magazine article.
.
.
.
Perhaps we should try? If experienced people had not decided that it was impossible I should not have been averse to trying.
We should have to cross out a few places recalling the defunct journal * (I have no rough copy of the Yuzhakov article, so the publisher will have to do it.
It is not a big job), and then place them at the end, so that if they are removed (in case the authorities demand it) it will not spoil the preceding articles.
If you estimate the cost of the publication at 40 rubies a printer’s signa-ture, the loss on those two articles (together four signatures) would not be so great.
In any case the book should not be delayed on account of them.
If they have not yet sent you the manuscripts from St.
Pe-tersburg, write an urgent letter to Nadezhda Konstantinov-na to send them immediately and start printing what I send today.
All the best, V.
U.

42 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA February 24, 1898 Today, Mother dearest, I received a pile of letters from all parts of Russia and Siberia and have therefore been in a holiday mood all day.
From Manyasha and Anyuta I received their letters of February 9 and also Yuridichesky Vestnik 89 and Statisti-chesky Vremennik and also the Dnevnik syezda (of techni-cians).
90 Thank you for everything.
The last-named was very interesting and thank Anyuta very much for it.
She writes that the book by de Amicis is a children’s book.
I did not know that, but even children’s books will be useful here, for Prominsky’s children have nothing to read.
I even thought of doing a thing like subscribing to Niva.
91 That would be very nice for the Prominsky kids (pictures every week), and for me a complete edition of Turgenev in 12 volumes as promised by Niva.
And all this for seven rubles, including postage.
Very tempting! If only Turgenev is pub-lished decently (that is, without distortions, cuts, clumsy misprints), it would be well worth while subscribing.
Have any of our people seen the Niva supplements for past years? I think they issued Dostoyevsky? Was it decently done? I now expect to set my money affairs right, since the book edition of the articles should also bring in something what-ever happens, and, moreover, I am getting a big transla-tion from English (from St.
Petersburg)—Adam Smith—and I shall get something for that.
92 I shall then be able to pay off my debts (I must not forget them).
That is why I think it is also possible to subscribe to Niva.
Whether Turgenevwill be “decently” published, our people must decide, they have more facts to go on.
Today I received Russkoye Bogatstvo No.
1 for 1898.
I have been receiving Vestnik Finansov for a long time.
I shall have to ask you to send a smallish sum of money by N.
K.
(there will be no need for it earlier.
The allowances were paid today), since there may be some fairly big expens-es to meet.
That means that my debt will increase slightly.
Things here are still the same—no news, no visitors and still no acquaintances.
Anyuta writes that N.
K.
has written to her saying that a publisher has been found in St.
Petersburg.
She wrote to me only that they had “promised to look for one”.
We may have an amusing muddle; the plan was evolved in St.
Petersburg independently and prior to my letter, and mine was also independent, prior to the receipt of the St.
Peters-burg letter.
And so we are dancing round each other like people who have bumped into one another in the street and do not know whether to step left or right to allow their vis-à-vis to pass.
The matter has probably settled itself by now.
Kisses for you and regards to all.
Yours, V.
U.
I understood from Manyasha’s letter that both books (Yuridichesky Vestnik, 1887, No.
12, and Statistichesky Vremennik) had been bought and would not have to be returned.
N.
K.
’s case is still dragging on.
She will probably have to drop the claim for a shorter term, but they do promise to permit her to come here.
I am enclosing a letter to her because she may now be in Moscow.
If not, send it on.
Manyasha, Send me, in addition, the following things: (1) Hardmuth pencil No.
6 (Anyuta bought me one last year and I liked it very much, but it has now, unfortu-nately, served its time).
(2) A box of sealing wax and some sort of a seal to seal my letters.
(If we have not got an old seal, either buy or order a cheap one.
) There is no need for a name on the seal, even initials are not necessary, as long as there is some sort of a figure or drawing on it that is easily remembered and described to others.
I had both of these but, alas, (3) essuie-plume * (4) small scissors they got lost somewhere on the road.
In place of the former I am now using the skirt of my jacket and have inked it up beautifully.
The scissors I get from the landlord—sheep shears.
Their advantage is that they always arouse laughter and general amusement.

Printed from the original43 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW March 1, 1898 I am still waiting for news, Mother dearest, of Mitya’s release, but it is a long time coming.
I am quite well and life goes on as usual.
Even winter at last seems to be coming to an end.
We have got very tired of it here.
Today and yesterday there has been real spring weather.
I am enclosing a letter for N.
K.
in case she has not yet left, and a business letter for Mark on the other side of the paper.
Yours, V.
U.
Mark, I have received some information that compels me to change my original plan to publish the book in Moscow.
* The writer informs me that censorship conditions in Moscow are impossible.
Bulgakov’s book (about markets) was held up for a year by the censors! That is something quite unbe-lievable! If that is the case we cannot even think of Moscow; we must turn all our attention to St.
Petersburg.
The writer has every chance of publishing it at the moment but he wants to delay it till autumn (wrongly, in my opinion).
As regards financing the edition, I think we can raise “an internal * This refers to the publication of Economic Studies and Essays.
—Ed.
loan” from Mother, because the book will certainly pay for itself.
This information has put me so much off my balance that I have nothing to propose.
You will probably be see-ing N.
K.
; talk to her about it and come to a decision.
To make a “decision” from here means writing, writing, writ-ing, and all for nothing, without knowing anything, depend-ing on guesswork, etc.
Yours, V.
U.
I hope you have not had any more unnecessary trouble over this unfortunate business.

4 Printed from the original44 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA March 8, 1898 This week, Mother dearest, I do not think I have had a single letter from you.
From this I gather that Mitya is still inside, and that is very sad.
I do not know now whether this letter will find N.
K.
in Moscow.
In case she is still there I am adding one forgotten request.
Send me one of our sets of chessmen; it turns out there are some players among our comrades in Minusinsk and I have once already recalled old times most enjoyably.
I was wrong in thinking Eastern Siberia an outlandish place where no chessmen would be needed.
There are all kinds of places in Eastern Siberia.
Life goes on as usual.
From Tesinskoye they write that E.
E.
has had her allowance stopped—“mothers are not regarded as members of the family ” (a new interpretation!).
They have also reduced Prominsky’s allowance from 31 rubles to 19 a month.
Anatoly has at last “rescued” his wife after a lot of trouble.
Yuly writes from Turukhansk that he is living tolerably well—not the kind of fellow to lose heart, fortunately.
Yours, V.
U.
I am enclosing a letter for Nadezhda Konstantinovna.
Please send me as much money as possible with her; if she has already left, send it to Yelizaveta Vasilyevna’s address.
There may be fairly heavy expenses, especially if we have to set up house for ourselves, so I am going to make my debt a good round sum and raise another internal loan.
By autumn I shall probably receive enough for my translation to cover my debts—I believe more than five hundreds.
* * The italicised phrase is in English in the original.
—Ed.
Anyuta, I should like to ask you to get me some English text-books.
I asked for something to translate and have received the Webbs’ 93 big book.
I am afraid I may make mistakes.
I need (1) an English grammar, especially syntax, and especially a section on idioms.
If N.
K.
has not got a Nurok (I think she had one but I do not know if it was hers), send me yours (or Manyasha’s) at least for the summer, unless you (or Manyasha) need it.
The only thing is that I do not know whether Nurok will give enough on this question.
If you could get a good textbook of English it would be a very good thing.
(2) A dictionary of geographical and proper names.
They are very difficult to translate and transcribe from English and I am very much afraid of making mistakes.
I do not know whether suitable dictionaries exist.
If there is no information in The Book about Books or in some other refer-ence work or catalogue, perhaps there is some other source from which you could find out.
If you have a chance to find out and to get something (in this case I do not grudge money, for the fee will be a large one and I must make a good job of the first attempt)— but there is no need to take any particular trouble; I shall get the German translation and will be able to refer to it.
Yours, V.
U.
What do you think about summer? Will Mitya be allowed to go to Kokushkino? Are you thinking of staying there or not? Moscow is a rotten town, isn’t it? It is a rotten place to live in and a rotten place to publish books in—so why stay there? I really was surprised when Mark informed me that you were against moving to St.
Petersburg.

4 Printed from the original45 TO HIS MOTHER March 14, 1898 I have received, Mother dearest, your letter of Febru-ary 28.
I did not expect you to return from Kazan so soon.
A few days ago I got a letter from there from Alexander Ivanovich which greatly surprised me.
He says he is now working, that Nikolai Ivanovich is in St.
Petersburg; and that they are living in the same place in Kazan.
94 I must make up my mind to answer it some time.
I know nothing about his health—it is difficult to draw any conclusion from his letter; if he is the same as he used to be, it will be difficult for him to go to work and it will not be easy for him to make a living, either.
If books can be sent by express on the railway and the charge is the same as for a slow train, it is, of course, better to send them that way.
The thing is when and to whom to send them? It is risky to send them to Achinsk, for Nadezhda Konstantinovna to take them on with her from there; they may be delayed and get left in Achinsk.
They will most likely have to be sent to Krasnoyarsk again and wait for someone coming from there.
I shall probably be able to find someone more easily now.
With regard to being transferred from here, I am not so far thinking of it.
In my opinion it would be premature.
I shall wait until Nadezhda Konstantinovna arrives and see how things turn out.
I am not writing to her today because I hope that she will have left Moscow by the time this letter arrives.
If, despite my hopes, she is still there when it comes, please tell her that yesterday I received the Germantranslation of Webb (it is a great help to me—I could not have managed without it) and Vestnik Finansov.
There is no need to worry about my health—I am now quite well.
We are now having fine weather, the sun is getting appre-ciably warm and the roads are beginning to deteriorate.
Winter, however, retreats very reluctantly here and there is still a long wait ahead for the warm weather.
You will probably receive this letter about April 1, or only shortly before.
I offer you and Manyasha my best wishes on the occasion of your name day.
I hope Mitya will definitely be out by Easter.
Yours, V.
U.
From Manyasha I have received Moskovskiye Vedomosti, 95 at first one issue (I forget which)—there were no interesting articles in it.
Yesterday I received four more issues (Nos.
53-56) in which I read some interesting little articles badger-ing Marxists.
Merci for them.
In the near future, in three or four weeks or perhaps earlier, we must expect the spring breakdown of communi-cations with Russia; for a fortnight or perhaps as much as three weeks, there will be no post to and from Russia.

4 Printed from the original46 TO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW March 28 Mark, I received your letter of March 10 acknowledging receipt of my manuscripts and proposing various plans.
You have, of course, received my letter in which I reject the idea of publishing in Moscow (I wrote that letter imme-diately after I learned about censorship conditions in Mos-cow) *.
It stands to reason that if things are so impossibly bad with the Moscow censor it is no use thinking of publishing there.
Why should we risk such a large sum of money when there may be a delay of a year or a year and a half (at least)? You must gather the manuscripts together, do them up in one packet and send them back to St.
Petersburg, to the writer, since he is kind enough to take the trouble upon himself.
Write to him about the money, telling him we have it, and that he should inform you how much he needs; and that he should see about the publication in autumn, without losing time, as soon as his own work permits.
Such is the outcome of two months’ correspondence! I hope you have not yet done anything definite.
If you have bought paper you can send it on to St.
Petersburg, and if you have started having it set you must pay for the pages already set.
It is better to lose a few dozen rubles than risk hundreds.
The writer (and you can believe him) speaks confidently about St.
Petersburg.

Of course, if I had had any idea of the charms of our “first capital city” and its censors I should never have dreamed of publishing a book in Moscow.

47 TO HIS MOTHER May 10, 1898 At last, Mother dearest, my visitors have arrived.
96 They got here on the evening of May 7, and on that very day I was clever enough to go shooting, so they did not find me at home.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna, I find, is not looking at all well—she will have to take more care of her health while she is here.
As for me—Yelizaveta Vasilyevna exclaimed, “Oh, how fat you’re getting!”; and so, you see, you could not wish for a better report! The terribly sad thing is that they did not bring any good news about Mitya! I received your letter sent with them and that of April 20.
A big merci for the things you sent.
N.
K.
has made arrange-ments in Minusinsk about the books that are to come and I hope I shall get them soon without any trouble.
I may fetch them myself as I intend going “to town”.
About steamers.
They took N.
K.
only as far as Sorokino (some 70 versts from Minusinsk) after they had waited a week in Krasnoyarsk.
The water in the river is still low; there will be high water about the end of May or beginning of June.
It is 55 versts from Minusinsk to Shusha.
The local steamers make irregular trips; there is no timetable, but, on the whole, once navigation begins they will probably run more or less regularly and without any unusual delays.
I would very much like you to come here if you could manage it—if only Mitya is released soon.
By the way, Anyuta asked me who I was going to invite to the wedding; I invite all of you, only I do not know whether it would not perhaps be better to telegraph theinvitations! As you know, N.
K.
has been confronted with a tragi-comic condition—she must get married immediately (sic!) or back to Ufa! Since I am not at all disposed to allow that, we have already begun “bothering” the authorities (mainly for identification papers, without which we cannot get mar-ried), so that we shall be able to marry before the Fast of St.
Peter * ; we permit ourselves to hope that these strict authorities will consider this a sufficiently “immediate” mar-riage?! I am inviting the people from Tesinskoye (they are already writing that I shall certainly need witnesses) and I hope they will be allowed to come.

My kisses, Yours, V.
U.
I almost forgot—Nadya tells me that some books on philosophy were on their way to me, and that they went past here to Irkutsk.
Why is it that I have never heard anything about this? Has some letter been lost? I would ask Anyuta to find out what happened.

48 TO HIS MOTHER May 17, 1898 This week, Mother dearest, I received Manyasha’s letter of May 1.
I have not yet received my books but I hope to get them soon.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna made detailed arrange-ments for them in Minusinsk.
It is probably not worth while subscribing to a newspa-per; I hope to get Syn Otechestva from Tesinskoye.

4 Printed from the original49 TO HIS MOTHER June 7, 1898 I received your long letter of May 20 the day before yesterday, Mother deare s t , merci.
L a s t t i m e I f o r g o t t o tell you that I had received the box of books in Minusinsk and brought it from there myself.
97 I cannot understand why you have not had any letters from me for a long time; I have been writing to you every Sunday “from time immemorial”.
Our wedding has been somewhat delayed.
I handed in an application for the necessary papers to be sent to us a month ago, and myself went to the police chief in Minusinsk to enquire the reason for the delay.
It turned out that the “status sheet” has not yet (Siberian ways!) been received in Minusinsk although I have been here in exile over a year (the “status sheet” is a paper identifying the exiled person and without it the police chief knows nothing about me and cannot give me any certificate).
It has to be obtained from the Krasnoyarsk prison authorities—I am afraid the police chief will not hurry with this.
In any case there cannot be a wedding earlier than July.
* I asked him to allow the people to come from Tes to my wedding and he refused out-right on the grounds that one political exile in Minusinsk (Raichin) got leave of absence to go to a village last March and disappeared.
.
.
.
My arguments that there was no reason to fear that the Tes people would disappear had no effect on him.
* Lenin and Krupskaya were married on July 10, 1898.
—Ed.
The Tes people have been given permission to stay in Tes till autumn, then they will move to Minusinsk.
I think I have already written you about steamer traffic on the Yenisei.
The water is still high—it is even rising again; it is very hot and the snow is probably melting in the forests on the mountains.
The steamers here (they are all tugs) do not run to a schedule; they take two days and sometimes more to get to Minusinsk from Krasnoyarsk.
From Minusinsk it is 55 versts by road to Shusha.
I hope I shall get a telegram from you if Mitya is released and you decide to come to us.
Yelizaveta Vasilyevna is worried that the journey may be too much for you.
If you can trav-el second class on the railway I do not think it will be too tiring.

4 Printed from the original50 TO HIS MOTHER June 14, 1898 I received a letter dated May 30 from Manyasha, Mother dearest; tell her merci for it.
But why does she not say a word about Voprosy Filosofii that I sent on May 14? Did she receive the book? (I sent it at Anyuta’s request; Manyasha writes that my letters of May 10 and 17 have been received.
) Life goes on as usual.
I think Nadya is going to write today.
We are now having real summer weather.
The heat is exceptional—Y.
V.
finds it very difficult.
Nadya and I have begun bathing and have gone over to a summer system.
There is little news, and what there is is bad.
In Tesin-skoye Comrade Yefimov (a worker from Yekaterinoslav) has gone mad; he is suffering from persecution mania and Gleb has taken him to hospital.
There has been a very nasty affair which concerns Yuly in Turukhansk; one of the exiles (a scandal-monger) made all sorts of silly accusa-tions against him and they had to part company; Yuly is now living alone, is ill, his nerves are all to pieces and he cannot work.
God save us from these “exile colonies” and exile “scandals”! Yuly has asked his father to try to get him transferred somewhere else, no matter where.
I am quite well (Nadya and Y.
V.
, too).
I am finish-ing the translation and shall then go back to my work again.
98 I have been informed that the collection of my articles is soon to be printed.

4 Printed from the original51 TO HIS SISTER ANNA July 15, 1898 Yesterday I received your letter of June 27.
I had a letter from the doctor yesterday, about N.
Y.
— he shot himself with a revolver.
He was buried on June 23.
He left a letter for Gleb, and manuscripts, also for him.
They say he asked me to be given a message to the effect that he died full of faith in life and not from disappointment.
I did not expect such a sad ending.
Probably the trouble caused by that scandal-monger had a terrible effect on him.
I believe I have already written about a box of books addressed to me from Vilno (I have not yet received it).
Can those be the books that have gone on to Irkutsk? When I get them I will inform you.
By the way, the mix-up over my books worries me far less (I have plenty of books) than the mix-up over the library book (which you say you will return in a few days).
I did not anticipate such an indescrib-ably lengthy delay! So all our efforts to avoid delays, to manage the return in six weeks instead of six months, have been a waste of time, have they? If so, it will be a very sad state of affairs, especially as all my chances of using the St.
Petersburg libraries came to an end when N.
K.
left.
I have even thought of asking you whether you could see the librarian yourself and persuade him to give you exact terms for the despatch of books, time of sending, general punctuality, etc.
It would not seem a very dif-ficult thing to do and yet in eighteen months absolutely nothing has come of it.
I think it’s about time we gave it up—it is no joke trying to do battle against “long distances”.
I am extremely surprised that you have not received Voprosy Filosofii.
It would be a pity for it to get lost, for it is a competently written book and not a cheap one; the set, furthermore, would be broken up.
I addressed it to Maria Ulyanova by registered post on May 15.
I still have the receipt.
Could I have sent it to the wrong place? (I may have sent it to your address at Sobachya Ploshchadka).
Please get all the information you can and let me know.
I will present the receipt at the post office and claim compen-sation for the loss.
I always inform you in my letters of books that I send.
So, if a book is a long time coming, you may expect information about it in due course.
It seems as if another of my letters has gone astray.
Sergei Ivanovich has written to me that he will be glad to have the post of doctor in Sredny Kolymsk.
I think he is right.
It is better to have a job; without it you go under in exile.
He will probably be able to live there well enough on 2,500 rubles a year.
Nadya and I are making a fair copy of the Webbs’ book.
I have to post it, by the terms of the contract, in the middle of August.
I am utterly fed up with this copying (about 1,000 pages for the two of us).
The translation was interest-ing, for it is a very, very useful book.
Yesterday Nadya received a letter from Apollinariya Alex-androvna in Krasnoyarsk.
She is being sent to the village of Kazachinskoye in Yeniseisk District, about 100 versts up the river from Yeniseisk.
There are a number of politi-cal exiles there—Lepeshinsky, Lingling, Rostkovsky, Gri-goryeva.
She has been in Krasnoyarsk for about 10 days and is now apparently continuing her way to her place of exile.
When do they intend to release Mitya? I did not expect them to make such a fuss over nothing.
And where will he go when they let him out? Kiss Mother, and regards to all.
Yours, V.
U.
Are you going to the Caucasus with Mark or not? I was very glad to learn that you have sent the money for the publication to the écrivain.
A big merci for that.
I shall now await events.
But tell them to reserve 25 copies for me as author—I will send them to comrades and acquaint-ances.
When you get them, send me 12 or 15 copies at once; I will write to you about the rest and tell you where to send them.

4 Printed from the original52 TO HIS MOTHER August 2, 1898 A few days ago I received your letter of July 15, Mother dearest.
I hope Mitya will have been released by the time you receive this.
His release has been promised so many times that he will probably be free by autumn.
The investigation of his case is dragging on much too long.
I think Manyasha’s plan to go to Brussels is a good one.
She can probably study there better than in Switzerland.
She will probably soon be able to cope with the French language.
They say that the climate there is good.
Nadya has an acquaintance * who lived in Belgium for about five years and is now preparing to go back there from Russia (to Liége).
He is married to one of Nadya’s close friends.
* Nadya is writing to her today asking her to write to Manya-sha (in Podolsk) and give her all the information and addresses that might be useful to her.
If the janitor at your old flat says that the postman brought “a yellow book” in May, it must have been the Voprosy Filosofii that I sent.
So we may hope that the book has not been lost and that we can still get it back.
I will wait another week to see what Mark can find out about it at work, and then report the loss.
I am very glad Anyuta intends to inform everyone not to send anything to the address of S.
M.
99 That foolish * For purposes of secrecy Lenin’s relatives removed names from his letter.

.
.
Of course I pay no attention to these foolish antics (probably caused by our quarrel with the Minusinsk crowd) and I shall receive the books that were sent to her.
But it would be pleasanter to manage with-out her.
If there are still people who have not been informed, let Anyuta write to them.
A few days ago I received some of the books (mostly on philosophy) that Anyuta bought for me.
The books for me that have now been received are still in Minusinsk; they include the con-tinuation of the philosophical series.
Among the books the following got in by accident— I think they are Anyuta’s—Baedeker, Suisse, and Jahrbuch des Unterrichtswesens in der Schweiz, 1892, 1893 and 1894 (three volumes); Anna should write and tell me what to do with them.
If I am to return them to her, should it be now or in the autumn (when we intend sending a box of books by rail).
[Apollinariya Alexandrovna Yakubova] * is being sent to the village of Kazachinskoye, Yeniseisk District (I believe I wrote this before); it is on the post road a hundred or more versts upstream from Yeniseisk.
The political exiles there are Lingling, Rostkovsky and others.
She has not yet written to us from there.
The Tes people expect to get transferred in the middle of August.
A detailed letter has arrived from the doctor in Verkho-lensk in which he describes the death of N.
Y.
Fedoseyev, and returns a letter from Anna to N.
Y.
which arrived after his death (he does not know whose letter it is) and asks what to do with the 25 rubles.
(They are collecting money there for a memorial.
) They (the comrades in Verkholensk) have also undertaken to pay N.
Y.
’s debts (about 80 rubles).
The doctor writes that the filthy accusations made against him by some scoundrel (also a political exile) concern-ing money affairs had a very adverse effect on N.
Y.
, and he decided not to take any money from anybody (and he * For purposes of secrecy Lenin’s relatives removed this name from the letter.
—Ed.
stuck to his decisions), so that he suffered extreme hardship, could not work, and, as the doctor put it, “when he real-ised he could not work he decided that he would not live”.

Printed from the original53 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA August 16 This week, Mother dearest, I received Anyuta’s letter of July 30.
I received it on Monday, August 10, in Minu-sinsk where I had gone to have my teeth seen to.
100 I was very surprised to get this letter, which came, as it turned out, by express train.
Incidentally, the transfer of letters from this express train (which goes to Tomsk) to an ordinary train usually involves a loss of time.
On Tuesday August 11, I received a Moscow newspaper for July 29 by ordinary train and the letter by express was sent on July 30, i.
e.
, not much quicker.
I cannot send letters by express train from here; to do so I should need friends in Ob 101 to whom I could send letters for posting on the express.
Try once again sending a letter by express and we will see when it arrives.
Today I am sending my Webb translation to St.
Peters-burg.
I have written that they should send my fees to you; if the écrivain does not know your address, inform him for this purpose.
There ought to be some news about my collected articles, but there is none and Nadya and I are beginning to think it a fiasco.
.
.
.
Manyasha, I think, is wrong to hesitate.
It would be useful for her to live abroad and study in one of the capitals, and studying in Belgium is especially convenient.
What subjects does she think of reading?You see, I was right in postponing the report that Vop-rosy had been lost; the book has not been lost but has been delayed so long that the reason for sending it is no longer valid.
Yours, V.
U.
Anyuta, By this mail I am sending you a registered packet contain-ing Negri, Tempeste, and the catalogue you asked for.
The address is the same as in this letter.
Acknowledge receipt.
At the same time as your letter I received news from Ar-changel that M.
G.
also shot herself (July 18) two days after she received news of N.
Y.
’s death.
A terribly tragic story.
And the wild slanders of some scoundrel by the name of Yukhotsky (a political exile! exiled to Verkholensk) played a major part in this finale.
N.
Y.
was terribly shaken by them and disheartened.
Because of them he decided not to accept help from anyone and he suffered terrible privations.
They say that two or three days before his death he received a let-ter in which the slander was repeated.
The devil knows what it all means! For people in exile, these “exile scandals” are the worst thing of all, but I would never have believed that they could assume such proportions! The slanderer was exposed a long time ago and condemned by all comrades, but I never thought that N.
Y.
(who had some experience of exile scandals) would take it so much to heart.
The day before yesterday I received Shakhov, Gumplo-wicz and Izvestiya (two issues, January and March); the delay of one mail day was the fault of our postman.
Yuly hopes to get out of Turukhansk soon.
In Tesinskoye they are having a wedding and will soon be moving to Mi-nusinsk.

54 TO HIS MOTHER August 26 Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received your telegram of the 21st about Mitya’s release and also your letter and Anyuta’s.
I was very glad to get all the news, especially about Mitya.
His being released means the investigation is finished; now it will be interesting to know what the prosecuting authority is preparing for him.
102 I am waiting for news of how you are getting fixed up for the winter.
Anyuta’s letter is very interesting and I was very glad to learn that my fears of a fiasco were premature.
* I am sending a registered package (to the same address as the letter) containing the manuscript of an article written a few days ago.
Please send it on to the écrivain with a request to try and place it somewhere; if it is too late for the collec-tion of articles, try one of the journals (Mir Bozhy, or per-haps Nauchnoye Obozreniye would be more convenient).
103 I don’t know whether it is convenient for me to send manu-scripts direct to St.
Petersburg.
I did that with Webb because the deadline (September 1) was only a fortnight away, but I don’t know whether it gave rise to any dis-satisfaction there.
For the time being I shall continue send-ing them to you.

E.
, it seems, has been decently provided for and feels better.
The doctors have not yet been able to give an exact diagnosis—either it is just a pain caused by a blow (she fell from a carriage about six or eight weeks ago) or an abscess of the liver, a serious complaint that is difficult to cure and requires lengthy treatment.
I am very sorry for A.
M.
, who has not recovered from the death of her child and her own illness; she becomes so agitated at times that she almost has nervous fits.
I would rather not leave her here alone, but my time is up and I must leave.
I am asking the local comrades to visit her.
As a result of my trip and of the need to help A.
M.
and make certain purchas-es, my finances are in a sorry state.
Please send Yelizaveta Vasilyevna (from whom I have received a loan) about a half of the sum that should be sent you for the (whole) Webb translation (sent to St.
Petersburg on August 15 * ).
If it has not yet been sent I think it will be better to wait a little while (or get someone to bring the money if the opportu-nity arises).
I shall not experience a crisis so there is no par-ticular hurry.

I am very pleased with my trip here; I have had my teeth treated and have had a breath of fresh air after eigh-teen months in Shushenskoye.
Few though the people in Krasnoyarsk may be, it is nevertheless pleasant, after Shusha, to see people and talk about something else besides shooting and Shushenskoye “news”.
The journey back is quite a long one (five days or so); the Yenisei steamer makes devilishly slow headway against the stream.
I shall have to stay below decks because the weather has turned unusu-ally cold (it goes without saying that I am wearing my winter clothes [and here I have also bought a sheepskin coat for Nadya] so I shall not suffer from the cold).
I have got in a supply of candles and books, so as not to die of bore-dom on the boat.
I shall probably have travelling with me Lepeshinskaya, the wife of an exile, who is going to work in the village of Kuraginskoye (about 40 versts from Minusinsk, where our comrade Kurnatovsky lives); her husband has been transferred to the same place.
Yesterday I heard the good news that Yuly had been transferred, but I do not yet know exactly where to.
The last letter I received from home was from Anyuta dated August 24.
Thank her very much for it and for the books (Neue Zeit, reprints from the Archiv, Kokhanskaya’s 104 biography and others).
I shall answer when I arrive in Shusha, in about ten days, that is; it is a pretty long delay but there is nothing I can do about it.
Yours, V.
U.
Many kisses for you and regards to all.
I have just seen A.
M.

I suppose you are fixing things up with Mitya and the tourists that have arrived.
It seems that Anyuta’s trip was not very successful.
That is a great pity because one does not manage to go to the Crimea very often.
How is Manyasha? Has she left yet? Did they arrange details of addresses and letters with her? If they did, write and tell me and I will write to her from here.
I am greatly surprised at the stubborn silence of St.
Petersburg; I sent the Webb translation on August 15 and up to now they have not even acknowledged receipt of it (I sent it by registered post, of course, addressed to P.
B.
, care of the warehouse).
There is also amazing silence about the collection of articles; the last letter was dated August 7 which said that proofs of over a hundred pages had been read, and means that the book was half ready.
Surely there could not be a delay of more than a month.
Probably it is a fiasco, but even so I expected them to send me the book (by registered post—there is nothing inconvenient in that).
I am quite at a loss, but Nadya and I are more and more inclined to think it a fiasco.
That would be unfortunate in the extreme.
I have finished the rough copy of my “markets” and have begun polishing it.

delay (I expect to send the first package off in a month’s time at the very latest); if the printing of the book begins in December, it could be in time for this season.
It will be necessary, however (if the previous book was a fiasco), to find a publisher and conclude a contract with him.
I am writ-ing all this in case Anyuta sees the écrivain—she often goes to St.
Petersburg or learns something by chance, and in general (even if she does not see or learn anything) it is interesting to talk and hear other people’s opinions.
We have no news at all.

58 TO HIS SISTER ANNA Anyuta, Today I am sending to Mother’s address two notebooks of the “markets”.
These are the first two chapters, about a quarter or a fifth of the entire work.
Altogether there are eight chapters and I am now finishing work on the third, so that by January it will most probably be finished because Nadya copies it quite quickly, as I write it.
Although I am abridging the first rough copy very considerably it is still an enormous size.
In the first two chapters 1 reckon there are about 270,000 letters, and if you count 33,000 letters as a printer’s signature, there will be about eight and a half signatures.
The whole book, therefore, will be about 35 or 40 signatures; I still hope to keep it down to 35, but even that will be a thick book (560 pages).
It is desir-able to have it printed in a big format with average-sized type, so that there will be about 2,400 letters to a page and more than 33,000 letters to the signature—that will be more convenient since there will be fewer pages.
As far as concerns the actual publication, apparently we shall have to place our hopes on finding a publisher.
If you happen to be in St.
Petersburg, perhaps you will discuss it with the écrivain.
Would Mrs.
M.
Vodovozova undertake to publish the book? 105 [I do not count on an independent edition because I consider the collection of articles to be a flop—although up to now I have not heard a single word about it or about the translation! If it should so happen that this is not the case, our own edition will also be possible; then it will be necessary to find a good, intelligent proof-reader, pay him properly and make it a condition for him to send off every signature immediately it is read.
] Printing can (and should) begin now (I say “should” because otherwise it will not be out by spring); it can then be sent by chapters and I promise that I shall not be late.
If a publisher is found, a detailed contract must be conclud-ed with him, and one absolutely definite condition must be the despatch of proofs [it is very difficult for anyone but the author to find misprints, for instance, in tables; and then there may be corrections and addenda, etc.
].
In spring the écrivain wrote to me that it could be printed in serial form in Nauchnoye Obozreniye or some other journal.
Of course I am not against that, but it is hardly feasible for any journal to take such a big thing—that would be very unusual.
It is far more likely that they would take a chapter or two for publication.
The second chapter, and the first as well, are independent and complete.
Having this in mind, we hurried to send off those parts that were ready imme-diately.
The only thing is, that if they are given to a journal an agreement must be reached on the deadline for printing them and also on the author’s right to publish the whole book without waiting for the journal to complete publication.
106 I am sending the Preface to the book, not for it to be printed (it will probably have to be revised or added to after a time) 107 but in order to give an impression of the plan of the book as a whole.
I will send the summaries for the table of contents with each chapter.
If such detailed summaries are not required (although in my opinion detailed contents are more convenient for the reader), they may be abridged and only the titles of the sections left.
* By the way, these section titles should not be set in bold-face type or italics (that is too imposing) but should, on the contrary, be set in the smallest available type.
That would take up less space and be more in accordance with the purpose of the headings.
As far as the tables are concerned, I also think they would best be set in small type, so as to take as little space as possible.
I feel that all these details may prove to be of no value— * The detailed table of contents to The Development of Capitalism in Russia was not abridged.
—Ed.
but for my part, at least.
, I want to do all I can.
It is quite possible that the écrivain will want, or will agree, to take the matter into his own hands—the one pity is, however, that he is unbelievably and incomprehensibly unpunctual in maintaining communications and is, apparently, absolute-ly incorrigible in this respect.
In general, he is rather too lavish with his kindness; his wife, for instance, herself read the proofs of the beginning of the collection of articles— a tedious job that takes up a lot of time.
Why should she have undertaken it when she already has so much to do? Under the circumstances it would have been much more convenient to hire (even if it has to be one they recommend) a special proof-reader 108 and demand that he is punctual in his work and informs you of the despatch of every sig-nature of the proofs.
Here I have to stop.
Please answer quickly, if only to acknowledge receipt of the manuscript.
Yours, V.

5 Printed from the original59 TO HIS SISTER MARIA November 11, 1898 We received your letter, Manyasha, and were very glad to have it.
We have now got out the maps and are trying to find out just where Brussels is—the devil take it.
We have discovered it and have given it some thought—a stone’s throw from London, and from Paris and from Ger-many, which puts it pretty well in the very centre of Europe.
.
.
.
Yes, I do envy you.
During the first period of my exile I decided not to look at a map of European Russia or Europe; there was always such a bitter taste in my mouth when I opened those maps and looked at the various black dots on them.
Now it does not worry me, I have learned to be patient and look at the maps more calmly; we even begin to wonder which of those dots it would be interesting to reach later on.
During the first half of my exile I looked mostly backwards, I suppose, but now I am looking ahead.
Oh well, qui vivra, verra.
* As for newspapers and books, please get hold of whatever you can.
Send all sorts of cata-logues from second-hand booksellers and bookshops in all languages.
There is a request I should like to make of you today, but I have decided to put it off till next time.
I would remind you of what I wrote to you or to Anna last year—the most interesting newspapers are the official organs that contain verbatim reports of parliamentary dis-cussions.
If you find out where such newspapers are sold (are there only Belgian or are there also French and English newspapers in Brussels?) and send the interesting issues * He who lives will see (Fr.

Printed from the original60 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA November 15, 1898 How are you managing to winter in Podolsk, Mother dearest? This is not a very merry winter for you—Mark has to live away from you, Mitya is chained to Podolsk.
He did not answer my questions about how he has to do his army service—in the ranks or as an assistant surgeon? Is there any information about his case, when it will end and how? Or none at all? How is Mark keeping? Is he not miserable alone in Moscow or is he up to his neck in work at his office and his evening lectures (does he still give them?)? 109 We have no news.
The only change is in amusements— now that winter has come I go skating instead of shooting; I recall the old days and find that I have not forgotten how, although it is about ten years since I last skated.
Nadya also wants to learn to skate, but I am not sure whether she will manage it.

Anyuta, I forgot to write to you by the last post that I had received Neue Zeit then.
Yesterday I got a bill from A.
M.
Kalmykova.
I have accumulated a debt of about eight rubles and still go on ordering and ordering.
I cannot under-stand why I still have not had the fees for the translation I sent to St.
Petersburg as long ago as August 15! If the money comes, please send fifty rubles or so to the book warehouse, and if it does not come by the time this letter arrives, Ido not know what to do.
If it is possible, it would be a good thing to send even ten rubles to the warehouse; as far as the fee for the translation is concerned, I have been told it will be paid in any case (there should not be any objec-tions from the censors)—and so it is only a matter of time.
Last time I wrote to you I asked you to send the book to various acquaintances of mine but forgot that you do not know the addresses.
110 I do not know the Archangel address-es myself.
Today at a guess I am writing to M.
E.
Grigoryev * at that sawmill where he works.
I think you have had some correspondence with Archangel; would it not be bet-ter, then, if you were to send them to your acquaintances to be handed on? If that cannot be done, leave them until you get the addresses.
The address of Lalayants is: Is.
Chris-toph.

It would be a good idea to send a copy to the Samaran, who writes in Nauchnoye Oboz-reniye.
** He is in St.
Petersburg, but I don’t know his address.
Am I not loading you down too much with requests? Wolfe’s are advertising a library of French classics at ten kopeks an issue.
Have you seen what sort of an edition it is? Yours, V.
U.
I was amazed to read that Labriola is being published in Russian! I can imagine in what distorted form! Could it have been you who translated Labriola? I read in Frankfurter Zeitung 111 a very interesting article about the Stuttgart Parteitag.

Printed from the original61 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA November 22, 1898 Today, Mother dearest, I have to write a long business letter to Anyuta.
For this reason I shall not write to you, especially as Nadya has already compiled a very lengthy description of our life here and I have nothing to add to it.
Her story is true in the main—only there is some exaggera-tion about my work on the “markets”.
* Yours, V.
U.
Ask Mitya to send Pamyatnaya knizhka Tulskoi gubernii** to Alexei Pavlovich Sklyarenko as soon as possible; I don’t know his address.
Anyuta, I received two of your letters together—dated November 1 and 4.
There is a good side to the publication having been handed over to Vodovozova; at any rate, the work is certain to be done.
Her account for the Studies seems to be perfec-tly correct and the smallness of the fee is due to the small number of copies.
113 I cannot, of course, accept such a fee for the “markets”.
I intend to take advantage of Vodovo-zova’s offer (if you see her, convey to her, of course, many thanks from me) to publish my “markets”—as for the financial conditions, I leave it to you (if it will not be too * See Krupskaya’s Letter No.
11.
—Ed.
** Which I am sending by registered post to your address today.
much trouble) to discuss that with her; I do not know which is better, a definite fee or “all the net profit”.
The more advantageous of those two methods of payment must, of course, be chosen, especially as I do not need the money in a hurry.
The most important of the conditions attending publication is to ensure perfectly good proof-reading.
Unless this is done it really is not worth while publishing anything.
The proof-reading of the Studies was very bad.
Apart from those misprints distorting the meaning * that I sent you, 114 there are numerous minor ones that comrades are already complaining to me about.
It is absolutely necessary to have a very intelligent, professional proof-reader; that must be made an absolute condition and I am even willing to pay such a proof-reader double in view of the author’s being unable to read the proofs himself.
This is especially true of tables—there are always mistakes galore, and in the “markets” there are a lot of tables.
Then (even if you have the best proof-reader) I must have copies of the final page proofs sent to me immediately, signature by signature, and I will send you a list of misprints.
The delay in issuing the book because of this will be (if they are sent punctually) at most a month; that is no great misfortune as long as the book is printed decently.
With regard to the date of issue— the work can begin now (we have the third chapter in a fair copy and in a few days I shall finish the fourth, that is, half of the book; the second half is much easier, so I can con-fidently undertake to send to Moscow the last chapter by Feb-ruary 15, or even earlier); this would be particularly conveni-ent for me, because I would have time to send in not only the misprints to the first signatures but perhaps some more important changes.
The format and the type should provide for about 2,400 letters to a page; the whole work would then be no more than 30 signatures, say 500 pages in round figures (more pages would probably be too many and would be bulky for the reader).
Lastly, with regard to the chart in Chapter II—special attention will be needed to make sure there are no mistakes in it.
Please talk to Vodovozova * At the same time as I sent the corrections to you I sent them to the écrivain with a request to print them, without fail, on a sep-arate sheet, to be put into the book when it was sold.
It is now neces-sary to make the same request of Vodovozova.
about all this and answer me as soon as possible after you receive this letter.
We shall send Chapters III and IV when they are finished, in about a fortnight.
Please send Manyasha another three copies of the Studies.
Alexander Leontyevich’s * address is Gudina’s House, Oper-naya Street, Archangel.
I have sent them to all the com-rades here.
Another copy must be sent to the Samaran who writes in Nauchnoye Obozreniye.
Out of the third of the fee you have received, a half will cover the money sent by Mitya for Yelizaveta Vasilyevna.
From the other half, please send a half to Kalmykova’s warehouse (I have run into debt there, and I order a lot of things) and use the remainder to subscribe to journals and newspapers for 1899; it is time, especially for the for-eign publications.
Russkiye Vedomosti for one year —8 rubles 50 kopeks (pay for ten months for me); Russkoye Bogatstvo for one year —9 rubles Mir Bozhy for one year —8 rubles Niva for 1899 —7 rubles Frankfurter Zeitung for the first quarter of 1899 —4 rubles 70 kopeks Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik, herausgegeben von Heinrich Braun.
For 1899 —1 marks.
We here greatly appreciate newspapers and journals, especially those that arrive in good time; that is why I ask you to subscribe as early as possible.

Mitya, Your information about my shooting is inaccurate.
Who told you about it? Maybe Anyuta made some chronological errors and produced some ancient myths about hares as up-to-date news.
In the autumn I made quite a good kill among the hares here—there are masses of them on the islands in the Yenisei and we soon got fed up with them.
Prominsky shot several dozen because he wanted the skins for a coat.
It is more interesting to shoot black grouse and partridge, but more difficult.
In July I got a few grey-hen, but now people go after them on horseback with rifles; in winter you can’t get near enough on foot (except on rare occasions).
For partridge (autumn) you need a good dog and my Jenny is either too young or simply no good.
In winter they mostly catch partridges in traps and snares.
* We now have a new attraction, a skating rink that takes me away from shooting quite a lot.
Next summer I hope to go shooting much more—there will be less work, the dog will be used to its job and it will be my last (I hope) summer in Siberia.

to employ a professional proof-reader (for the Studies)— there are numerous misprints, and I am particularly wor-ried about those that distort the meaning, a list of which I sent to you and to him.
I am expecting an answer in a day or two as to whether they can be stuck in somewhere; they are essential.
I think there is hardly any sense in undertaking an edi-tion of our own; first, it is desirable to establish permanent relations with Vodovozova, who is suitable as a publisher; second, the sum (needed for the edition) is very, big, and the matter is very tedious, complicated and difficult.
In doing it ourselves for the first time we are certain to make all sorts of mistakes and I am very anxious that this publication should be outwardly irreproachable, even if it costs a few hundred rubles extra.
Thirdly, there is no very great difference in time; my letter will arrive by Christ-mas and Vodovozova is arriving in February—it may per-haps be possible to communicate with her in writing.
And how much time would be wasted (in the case of our own edition) on travelling, searching, etc.
It is very hard to keep track of a publishing job from another town.
Would it not be better, therefore, to write to Vodovozova? Ask her when she can start setting the book, how much time it will take, will it be possible to issue the book before the end of April, etc.
As far as the terms are concerned, I think it is better to take the net profit rather than fees per signature.
In the former case I would expect to receive about one-third of the gross sum or even more; in the latter, to make up such a sum it would be necessary to pay a minimum of 75 rubles for each printer’s signature, which would be burdensome and risky for the publisher.
I have finished four chapters and even the writing of the fair copy will be finished today, so I shall be sending you Chapters III and IV in a day or two.
I hope you will receive the whole book in February.
If you are going to read the manuscript, by the way, please send me your remarks.
In my rough copy I have marked off the pages of the fair copy, so that I can send corrections.
And, again, about the Studies—send me any press reviews that you or any acquaintances come across, because here I do not keep up with the current press.
If small type and tables cost more to set, the publisher will have to spend quite a lot on the “markets” because there are many tables, and some diagrams as well.
The total volume of the book, as far as I can tell at present, comes to about 450 pages at the rate of 2,400 letters to a page, which is less than I anticipated.
If the pages are like those in Vodovozova’s publications (they are very widely spaced with no more than 2,000 letters to a page) there will be no less than 550, so smaller type is desirable.
It is very desirable to print all the tables in small type, other-wise they will take up a lot of space, be less graphic and not be taken in at a glance by the reader.
The tables that are printed sideways on a whole page are particularly incon-venient (i.
e.
, you have to turn the book round to read them).
All this is very important to the reader.
It would be a good thing to have the type used in the tables in the appendices to Vodovozova’s book Zemlevladeniye i selskoye khozyaistvo; all the tables in the second and other chapters should be set in this type (most of the tables are in Chapter II; there are fewer in the other chapters, but there are some).
You must talk to the publisher about all this and also about sending me the proofs (as I have already written).
To speed up publication it could be done at two printing works, Part 1 (the first four chapters) and Part 2 separately, with the pages numbered individually.
With regard to Mark’s proposal to change the title and make it a two-volume edition—I do not think this would be convenient.
The more modest and heavier-sounding title is better because of the censorship; to change the title would mean that I would have to make a large number of petty, and, therefore, onerous changes in the text.
It is not a good thing to split it into two volumes.
If you take the format and type of the Studies as the standard, each volume would be smaller than that book (and they could not be sold as separate volumes because the composition is a single whole with cross references to different chapters, etc.
).
As to price, I did not expect it to be more than 3 rubles and consider a higher price to be undesirable (and a lower price would mean los-ing money).
As many copies as possible should be printed * ; * I agree completely with Mark that there “must be” at least 2,400.
But what will the publisher say?it is a pity that such a small number of the Studies was put out.
With regard to censorship obstacles to the “mar-kets”—I do not expect any, unless there is to be a period of toughness and special severity against our people.
If the Studies sell well, the “markets” will probably sell better.
This should be impressed on the publisher.
There is also the question of the number of copies to be supplied to the author (I hope you sent Manyasha another three copies of the Studies).
I think we should take fifty, because this time I shall have to send them to many people and sometimes to exchange them for Zemstvo statistical publications.
Well, I think I have chattered away long enough—and there must be many repetitions of what has been said before in other equally long business letters! You must be bored with reading all these repetitions.
It is very much like my writing—the first rough copy of the “markets” I have scratched about and abridged most ruthlessly.
All the best, V.

Mail days here are Tuesday and Friday, but that, of course, is not what interests you.
We receive Wednesday’s and Friday’s newspapers, on the fourteenth day from the day of issue, that is.
It is, therefore, more convenient for you to write on Tuesdays and Fridays (from Moscow, of course; about Podolsk I do not know).

Anyuta, Today I am sending a registered letter containing the third and fourth chapters of the “markets” to Mother’s address.
I have made a more exact calculation of how much I have written; in the first four chapters there are about 500,000 letters.
* That is fewer than I imagined (and the second part will be less than the first).
My fears were ground-less; the type that gives 2,000 letters to the page will * I have counted about 900 letters to a page (and about 1,600 letters in those long pages that have been used for Chapter II).
be quite all right.
I have nothing against an edition of two separate volumes—decide yourselves with the publisher.
The only thing is the figures—the figures!—they will get them all wrong unless they send me the proofs to correct.
* Please make two corrections to the manuscript: (1) in the Preface strike out everything from “As we know” in the second sentence to “opponents’ views” in the third; in the next sentence instead of “it seemed to us” write “it seemed to the author”.
I think it might be rather dangerous to speak about “opponents” in the very first paragraph.
116 (2) On page 44 cross out the footnote at the end of Section VI and in place of it write: “cf.

You write that you received my letter of November 15 ** and did not receive the previous one about books.
I no longer remember exactly when I sent it, but I know for sure that immediately after I received books from St.
Petersburg I sent you an ordinary letter with a list of misprints that distort the meaning and a request to distribute a few copies among acquaintances, including another three for Manya-sha (in addition to one for herself), one to St.
Petersburg, not to the old man but to the Samaran, one to Kokushka (I have not sent him one); and three for you, three for the Chicagoan, the author of The Factory (T.

Printed from the original65 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S MOTHER December 20 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Today Volodya has unexpectedly gone out shooting so I am writing.
Recently the frost here has been as much as 20° below zero, but today it is only two and a half degrees below and Volodya was tempted to go out with his gun, especially as the Shushenskoye sportsmen have a theory that this is the best time to go after grouse; the birds have not eaten during the heavy frosts and are now so busy eating that they do not see a man approaching.
Volodya has taken somebody else’s gun because he has broken his own; the barrel proved to be made of cast iron and cracked merely from being dropped on the ice.
We sent the gun to Minu-sinsk but the gunsmith there refused to repair it.
And so we shall have to buy another.
We have heard that a very good double-barreled gun is for sale in Minusinsk and Volodya is thinking of acquiring it.
We are now busy preparing for a trip to Minusinsk.
Actually our preparations boil down to Volodya pinning a sheet of paper to the wall and writing down everything we have to buy in town.
Mother is not going with us—first she said “no” because the road was bad, and now she says it is too cold.
We are going on Christmas Eve and shall return on the first or second, so Volodya’s next letter will be from Minusinsk.
I do not know whether Volodya told you that Kurnatovsky and the Lepeshinskys are coming to Minusinsk for Christmas, and that they intend to skate, play chess, sing, argue, etc.
It looks as though we shall have a good time.
When the “markets” are finished there is a plan to settle down to the study of languages in general and German in particular.
Volodya is ordering Pavlovsky’s Russian-Ger-man Dictionary from the warehouse and asks Anyuta to get hold of Turgenev in German and a decent German gram-mar.
I have heard that one of the best German grammars is that of F.
Fiedler but I do not know for sure.
Oh, by the way, we suspect that our surmise about Zhizn 119 was incorrect.
If so, it is not, of course, worth while subscribing to it.
We have received only one letter from Manyasha.
Why doesn’t she write? Perhaps her letters do not reach us—she should register them.
Volodya has come home and is making a fuss about my staying indoors and not going skating.
So I shall close now.
“Happy New Year!” Kisses for you and Anyuta, regards to D.
I.
and M.
T.
* Mother sends best regards to all.
There is nothing to write about at the moment, but there may be after Minusinsk.
Again, kisses, Yours, Nadya I add my New Year’s greetings.
With regard to the translation of Turgenev—I should think it would be best to enquire at Wolfe’s and at the same time to get a catalogue of Reclaim 120 editions.
It does not matter to us which of Turgenev’s books you get, the only thing is that the translation must be a good one.
We should like a German grammar that is as complete as possible, especially as regards syntax.
It would probably be better if it were in German.
Perhaps we should go over to Wolfe altogether for ordering books and for information.
Kal-mykova’s warehouse is not very forthcoming with infor-mation; I asked them to get me a reprint of N.
Karyshev’s article “Material on the Russian National Economy” from the Second Issue of the second part of Izvestiya Moskov-skogo selskokhozyaistvennogo instituta for 1898, but they refused to fulfil my request or even send me the address of Izvestiya.
Can you get it? All the best, V.

Oulianoff, Rue des Minimes, 40, Bruxelles, Belgique December 22, 1898 I have received Kovalevsky’s book from you, Manyasha, but not a single letter.
This surprises me (and all of us); since that first letter from you we have not had another.
Are letters being lost? Or, perhaps, you are so full of your new life that no time is left for letters? I have had Kova-levsky’s book for a long time; I got it in November, when I ordered it from a Petersburg shop; I started reading it but, I must admit, did not finish it—it is a boring compila-tion.
Write and tell us when you think of coming for the summer, what newspapers and journals you are reading, and whether you have got to know Brussels properly and the publishing business there.
Send me Journal officiel, 122 when it contains interesting parliamentary speeches.
I intend writing you a long letter after Christmas, to celebrate which we are going to Minusinsk in a few days.

Printed from the original67 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA Minusinsk, December 28, 1898 I am writing to you, Mother dearest, from Minusinsk; Nadya and I are here for Christmas and will remain until the first.
We are having an excellent time here.
This is just the kind of holiday from work that we needed.
Among other things we skate very strenuously, sing, and so on.
Yours, V.
U.
I am writing to Anna separately.
Yesterday I got a letter from Manyasha with her new address in Brussels.
Anyuta, I have received your postcard of December 5 and your letter of December 8.
Thanks for them.
I read a detailed account of the écrivain’s lecture in Russkiye Vedomosti.
Of course, it was hardly worth while putting forward such new views in a short lecture: The remains of Fedoseyev’s work would be interesting in this respect; I think he held very different views on landowners’ farms before the reform.
123 (I do not remember whether I informed you that we have received N.
Z.
up to No.
24 inclusive.
) With regard to Pamyatnaya knizhka Tulskoi gubernii, I wrote that it was for A.
Sklyarenko whose address I did not have at the time.
I informed you a long time ago that I had received the report of the literacy committee.
* I am in agreement with the writer’s advice (to send it to the printer immediately, use the same format and type as Tugan-Baranovsky’s book 1 2 4 and not send the proofs * See Letters Nos.
61 and 64.
—Ed.
here).
The type used in that book will be compact enough; it will come to about 500 pages.
I have finished another two chapters (V and VI) and chapter five has been rewritten.
I hope to finish in January.
Of course, I agree to entrust the second proofs to you and shall be very, very grateful to you for this strenuous and thankless work.
I nevertheless think a professional proof-reader is indispensable; in my opinion two rubles a printer’s signature is too little—pay him three rubles or more per signature for the reading of two proofs and take the third (not the second) proof yourself.
For misprints send them to me (not one signature but 5-10 at a time).
I do not think, however, that it will be very convenient for me to send you the rough copy; I sometimes need to make additions, inserts, etc.
, and I cannot do this without the rough copy.
Could you not pay the proof-reader more and have him send the pages of the fair copy with the proofs? If that is impossible I will, of course, send the rough copy (you can demand it by telegram “send rough copy ” ).
Yours, V.

Printed from the originalQX 68 TO HIS MOTHER January 3, 1899 Nadya and I returned from Minusinsk yesterday, Mother dearest, where we had spent a week with Gleb and Basil very pleasantly and saw the New Year in among com-rades.
125 There were many toasts on New Year’s eve but the one most heartily greeted was that proposed by one of the comrades “to Elvira Ernestovna and absent mothers”.
Today we have not been able to get back into our routine, but tomorrow we shall set to work again.
Chapter VI of my book is finished (but not yet rewritten); in a month or so I shall finish the book altogether.
I answered Anyuta’s letters of December 5 and 8 while still in Minusinsk * ; I wrote to her that I agreed to the immediate despatch of the first chapters to the printer, to having the proofs corrected without the author (it is desirable to have three and not two proofs) and the despatch of the final (clean) copy only to the author and, in general, that Anyuta should take charge of publication and do as she thinks fit.
I hope Anyuta received my letter.
At the same time I sent a letter to Mitya asking him to buy me a gun.
Will it cause any difficulties of a financial nature? Something seems to have gone amiss with my fees and I keep ordering books from Kalmykova’s warehouse, so I am beginning to have twinges of conscience.

Printed from the original69 TO HIS MOTHER January 10, 1899 Your letter and Anyuta’s, sent on December 24, I have received, Mother dearest.
As Nadya will write in detail, there has been a hitch with the parcel.
* You write that my letter of the 6th ** arrived on the 22nd and that such a delay seems strange to you.
I do not know the reason.
Perhaps the letter was late in leaving Minusinsk; sixteen days is not long, seeing that we receive newspapers from Moscow on the thirteenth day.
With regard to the proofs of the “markets”, I have to admit that the writer’s statement that the manuscript is exemplary does not appease me; the writer has on one occasion shown himself to be a poor proof-reader and, in gen-eral, it is not his business and not within his capacity to handle such tedious work properly.
I think, therefore, that it will be necessary to insist on three proofs and not two (the last to go to Moscow), and on Anyuta being in direct contact with the proof-reader.
I am afraid of its being pub-lished as badly as the Studies—that would be very sad.
In general it is very difficult, impossible even, to give you answers to all minor and partial questions from here; they must be settled there, on the spot.
I am not, therefore, quibbling over the change of the title, even though I do not like it, and the idea that it will “go” better with a broader title is something else I do not like.
I deliberately chose * See Krupskaya’s Letter No.
12.
—Ed.
** See Letter No.
63.
—Ed.
a modest title.
If, however, it is preserved as a sub-title it is not so important and, I repeat, all minor questions must be decided immediately on the spot.
My answers from here are always delayed and useless.
If it is possible and convenient I should like to have the last proofs, even if at the rate of 5-10 signatures at a time.
I read in Russkiye Vedomosti about Tugan-Baranovsky’s debate.
Yes, he should have answered Kablukov 126 more sharply! We shall soon be sending the fifth and sixth chapters; there may possibly be a delay with the end but it will not be very great.
I do not think it will hold matters up.

Merci for it.
On Tuesday we also received Neue Zeit from Anyuta.
It is most satisfactory that all last year’s issues of Neue Zeit are gradually reaching us.
Anyuta, of course, has read Die historische Berechtigung, etc.
, in the issues she sent me.
I had read that article before this and am in complete agreement with its arguments (as are other com-rades here).
By this mail I am sending you two more note-books with parts of my book (Chapters V and VI) (&a separate page—the table of contents); these two chapters contain about 200,000 letters and the last two chapters will contain approximately as many.
I should like to know whether they have begun to print the beginning, about how much time it takes to set a signature and if Anyuta is reading the last proof as she originally intended doing.
If that is the case I do not think there would be anything inconveni-ent in sending the author the first few signatures together with other books.
However, the pros and cons of this have probably already been considered without reference to my opinion.
We have no news.
Yuly has not written for a very long time, which surprises and worries me.
Anatoly is still unwell, poor fellow; he recently went down with typhus and 128there were some subsequent lung and heart complications.
We advise him to apply for a transfer to Minusinsk District because the climate in Yeniseisk District is much worse, but he will have his own way.

6 Printed from the original71 TO HIS SISTER MARIA Mlle Marie Ouljanoff, Rue des Minimes, 40, Bruxelles, Belgique January 24, 1899 I have received the catalogues you sent, Manyasha.
A big merci for them.
There are some interesting things in them.
I intend sending you a list of the books I should like to acquire.
Write and tell me if you have become familiar with Brussels in general and with book publishing and bookselling in particular.
I should like to read the verbatim reports of some interesting parliamentary discussions.
In Paris, for instance, they are to be found in the Journal officiel, each issue of which can also be bought separately, of course.
I do not know whether it is obtainable in Brus-sels.
The Belgian government newspaper most probably publishes similar reports too.
Where did you get the English catalogues? Are there English bookshops in Brussels or did you order them from London? I am now busy with urgent work; there is not much left for me to do to finish my book, and then I shall most likely have to start contributing to the magazines.
That is why I am writing very little, especially as Nadya says that she will write in detail about our life here.
If you come across anything in second-hand bookshops on the economics of farming in France, Britain, etc.
(farm-ing statistics, enquêtes, the reports of British commissions),or on the history of industrial forms (among others, Bab-bage, Ure—the older writers on this subject), please buy them if the prices are moderate.

6 Printed from the original72 TO HIS BROTHER January 26, 1899 I have received your letter about guns and hasten to reply without awaiting the promised price list.
I have the price list of the gunsmith’s shop belonging to I.
Schön-bruner (Stary Gazetny Street, between Tverskaya and Nikit-skaya Streets, in the house of Tolmachov), which Mark sent me last winter.
The most suitable on the list seem to me to be the centre-fire guns by August Francott in Lüttich, pp.
6-7 (45-55 rubles with a choke barrel—incidentally, is it true that the choke increases the concentration of the shot and the accuracy of the gun, as the price list claims and as I have heard from sportsmen? If so, it must be a very useful thing—12 and 16 calibre, weight about 7 2 lbs) —and on page 22, a light gun by the same firm (6 2 lbs, and a barrel of 14 2 vershki * and not 17, also with a choke, 65 rubles for a 12 calibre).
** You ask about calibre and weight.
I have a 12 calibre gun and I have some cartridges (brass) of that calibre left (made by Y.
Torbek; I paid 12 kopeks each for them); this is the size.
*** However, you’ll probably have to buy new cartridges (25, brass, will be enough, I think) because the cartridges have to fit the gun exactly.
And so you must choose the calibre and weight yourself; it is not important, as long * About 25 2 inches; vershok= 1 w inches (approx.
).
—Ed.
** There are cheaper guns: 42 rubles (p.
10), 35 rubles (p.
14, fig.
No.
18, without choke).
If it shoots well and is reliable, that will do.
I am not interested in the ornament.
12 calibre is a bit big, perhaps 16 calibre would be better.
*** Here Lenin drew a small circle in pencil.
—Ed.
as it has a good range (it goes without saying that, all other things being equal, a light gun is preferable; perhaps it really is better to have a heavier barrel, in case of necessity it can be scoured, and it won’t break or buckle so easily.
I have been spoiled, you know, with my light plain-bore gun!).
I was particularly interested in the terms Schönbru-ner offers; “selection of the gun is made by the purchaser if he is present at the test, or by the shop” (p.
3), and not a word about any special payment for a test! But you should not leave it to the shop, of course, to make the selec-tion, you must test the gun yourself and measure the spread of the shot * and take the test sheets.
It is strange that they should test it “at 50 arshins ** ” (p.
3 N.
B.
)! What the devil do they mean by that? What game can you shoot at a distance of 17 sagenes? *** I always tested my gun at 25 to 3 0 sagenes.
That, incidentally, may be due to my inexpe-rience.
If you “hold a consultation” (oho!) all this will probably be weighed up.
I was extremely surprised to learn that Schönbruner considers the weight of a gun for transport purposes to be 35 pounds (sic! p.
108—“over long distanc-es”).
That’s scandalous—17 rubles 50 kopeks! The gun weighs 7 2 lbs which is 4 rubles and for the box (you write) about 2 rubles, which comes to about 7 rubles, just as I wrote to you and as I have been told in Minusinsk.
Would it not be better to order a box yourself and send it? A device for filling cartridges, the simplest kind (I have one that cost a ruble seventy-five kopeks; the thing for getting the caps out is just a spike on a stick.
In Schönbruner’s price list, p.
75, fig.
No.
133, the “ordinary local” kind are I ruble 75 kopeks).
I do not need a game bag (when I kill anything I bring it home on a bit of ordinary string!), I have a cartridge pouch, a soldier’s (leather) cartridge box that holds 12 cartridges, and the other 8 or 9 go in my pock-et; there is also a sling, although it would be better to fit a ring for it in the shop, if it can be done.
What do you mean by “caps of a suitable calibre”? Caps are the same size for all breech-loaders, aren’t they? I am marking out the size * It is as well to take the measurement if they test the gun in the shop, otherwise there will be a lot of trouble getting it.
** Arshin= 28 inches.
—Ed.
*** Sagene= seven feet.
—Ed.
of my caps at the top * ; if they are not the same size you had better send about 500, of course, or even more; here only the kind I have are available.
With regard to wads—I use ordinary newspaper and thought buying them an unnecessary luxury.
If I am wrong in that (if wads are important for striking power) and if they are really cheap (as you write), then send me either some wads or an instrument for cutting them (in the price list p.
92, 75 kopeks; I have heard that it is a very con-venient thing to have.
Write and tell me whether you use one and what sort of cardboard you use).
There is no need to buy a cover specially—I have a simple one, the old one they gave me in the shop in Krasnoyarsk with the gun.
** One of the comrades tells me that wire brushes are very useful.
I think that is all.
If there is a second-hand gun that has been tested and has no defects in the barrel, of course it is worth while taking it.
Address the gun to Yelizaveta Vasilyevna.
There is no great hurry—it should be here by March 1, and even the end of March will be all right.
I am very, very glad that your case is taking a turn for the better, and that there are fresh hopes of getting into the University.
The mistake at the beginning of § II of Chap-ter IV (p.
346) you did well to notice; thanks for that.
It should read 41.
3 million chetverts 130 and not 14.

*** In my first rough copy I had it right, in the second rough copy I made a mistake and did not notice the absurdity.
Please send the correction immediately.
With regard to the word “rational” in the quotation from Kablukov, there is no need to change it; there is no doubt that here Kablukov means “reasonable” and not technically rational; I also understood “rational” to mean “reasonable” and not “tech-nically rational”.
I ridiculed him on this point because * Here Lenin drew an arrow pointing to the margin where he showed the size of the cap in pencil.

** Will the cover from a single-barrelled gun do? Incidentally, I think it would be better to get one made here, they sting you badly in the shops.
*** Collected Works, Vol.

—Ed.
his argument is pure tautology, since the Narodniks con-sider natural economy to be “reasonable”.
Should the reader understand “rational” in the second case differently from the first (i.
e.
, different in Kablukov’s words than in mine)? * Tobacco plantations actually number 75—95—650 thous-and (i.
e.
, 75,000, 95,000, 650,000).
** Skating is something I do with the greatest of zeal.
In Minusinsk, Gleb showed me a number of tricks (he is a good skater) and I have been practising them with such industry that once I hurt my hand and could not write for two days.
My old skill has not been forgotten.
This kind of exercise is far better than winter shooting, when you flounder up to your knees in snow, spoil your gun and rarely see any game! All the best, V.

Printed from the original73 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Vinogradov’s House, Bronnitskaya Street, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia January 30, 1899 Yesterday, Mother dearest, I received Neue Zeit from Anyuta and a price list from Mitya.
Merci for them.
Today I read an announcement about Nachalo 131 in Russkiye Vedomosti.
It is a good thing I have managed to finish my “markets” just in time for the beginning of Nachalo (I finished them at long last today.
On Wednesday I am send-ing in the last two chapters) and now I shall be free to do a little work on current affairs.
I have received a little book to review, but have not yet managed to read it.
132 I do not remember whether I wrote about Anatoly being ill all the time.
He has had another misfortune; an order has arrived transferring him to the village of Antsiferovo (several dozen versts to the north of Yeniseisk on the road to Turukhansk) 133 —further banishment to punish him because an exile by the name of Makhnovets (who only arrived this winter) ran away and gave somebody Anatoly’s address.
From this the conclusion was drawn in some incomprehensible manner that Anatoly must have known about the escape! So far Anatoly has not been moved because of his illness—he cannot even go out of the house.
He has applied to be transferred to Minusinsk District or to Russia for treatment.
Nothing has been heard about Yuly’s transfer.
Three exiles have also been transferred from the village of Kazachinskoye (where A.
A .
Yakubova lives); those transferred are Lengnik, to a place not far from us, Are-fyev and Rostkovsky, so the Kazachinskoye colony has been very, very much thinned out.
Kurnatovsky (he lives in the village of Kuraginskoye, some 100 versts away from us) asked to be transferred to Shusha; he has been refused; he is now being transferred to the village of Yermakovskoye (about 40 versts from Shushenskoye), where he will be quite alone.
We are having exceptionally good weather; very light frosts (10-12 ° ), bright days and sunshine that is already springlike.
This is not a Siberian winter! Many, many kisses for you and regards to all.
Yours, V.

6 Printed from the original74 TO HIS MOTHER February 3, 1899 Today, Mother dearest, I am sending you the last two parts of my “markets”, Chapters VII and VIII, and two Appendices (II and III) 134 and the headings of the last two chapters.
At last I have finished a work that at one time had threatened to drag on infinitely.
I would ask Anyuta to send them on to the writer as soon as possible together with the enclosed review of Gvozdyov’s book.
The writer sent me the book “for review” and I thought it would be awkward to refuse from here.
But I did not enjoy writing the review.
I did not like the book—nothing new, general-ities, an impossible style in places (he writes about “con-nivances at farming” and things like that).
He is at the same time a supporter and an opponent of the Narodniks and, most important of all, a Nachalo collaborator.
Little as I like that “Samara” spirit, * I nevertheless decided to restrain myself and fill up four-fifths of the review with remarks against the Narodniks and one-fifth against Gvoz-dyov.
I do not know whether the editors will like it; I do not know their relations with the “Samarans”.
Nadya is writing to the écrivain’s wife about all this today.
Many kisses for you and best regards to all.

Printed from the originalThe first page of Lenin’s letter to his mother February 3, 189975 TO HIS MOTHER February 7, 1899 Today I am sending you, Mother dearest, another small package (registered)—first, the issue of Izvestiya 135 I was asked to return and, second, a review 136 that I ask you to pass on to the writer.
By the next post I will send a little addition to Chapter VII.
I hope it will not be too late.
I think I forgot to write last time that according to my rough calculation the whole book contains about 934,000 letters.
This is not very much, altogether something like 467 printed pages, counting 2,000 letters to a page.
If, however, there are fewer letters to the page, for instance 1,680 (as in Tugan-Baranovsky’s Crises)—which, of course, would make the edition unnecessarily expensive—there will be about 530 pages.
Anyuta apparently did not receive the letter (written a very long time ago) in which I asked her to send me (1) a decent German translation of Turgenev and (2) a detailed German grammar (oven one in German for Germans, because those for Russians are usually very brief).
* I want to make a real study of German.
Now I ask you to send me a Russian-German Dictionary, one of those we have at home, Lenström, or bettor, Reiff’s dictionary of Russian and three European languages.
I wanted to order Pavlovsky’s * See Letter No.

6 Printed from the original76 TO HIS SISTER ANNA February 13, 1899 Anyuta, I have received your letter of January 27 and am delight-ed with the news about the “markets”.
If my letter of Ja-nuary 10 was, as you say, too pessimistic, this one will probably be far too optimistic.
I am very grateful to V.
A.
, Mitya and especially you for the trouble you have taken with the book, about the fate of which—as far as a satisfactory edition is concerned—I am now quite reas-sured.
With regard to the title—I am inclined to agree that mine is too long; it is, true enough, a necessary one, but it would be better as a sub-title.
The title itself sho-uld be more modest than The Development of Capitalism in Russia, which is too bold, too broad and promises too much.
On the Problem of the Development of Capitalism in Russia would, in my opinion, be better.
I did not receive Ribot’s booklet (Affektivnaya pamyat) which you say you sent.
137 There seems to have been a delay, either in your sending the registered packet or in the delivery here.
I wrote in an earlier letter about the approximate number of letters in the entire composition, so it should be easier for you to calculate how many more pages there will be.
I am anxiously awaiting the first two chapters—typographic-ally the second is the most difficult.
You did well to con-vince V .
A .
not to make changes “according to sense” (incidentally, with regard to the little illustration you werequite right—that is indeed what I meant to say, little and not nice.
As regards sharpness of tone, I am now in favour of toning down such passages and decreasing their number.
I have realised that they are much stronger in print than in speech or in a letter, so one must be more moderate in this respect).
I am also very, very pleased with the tables, with your having convinced the printer not to omit decimal fractions but to print them below the level of the whole numbers and in a different type and not to print the tables sideways.
Even if it makes the publication somewhat dearer, it does not matter very much.
Judging from your approximate estimate of the cost, you will probably be able to fix the price at no more than 2 rubles 50 kopeks for an edition of 2,400 copies.
* With regard to all that, however, I leave it entirely to you to decide.
It will also be interest-ing to see how well the diagram comes out.
138 What do the statisticians say about it (V.
A.
and the other ** )? Several remarks have been made to me about its being unusual.
Does it serve its purpose of being clear and convincing? The publisher *** wrote to me about the “Heritage”; there is a certain grain of truth in his remarks.
139 As far as the Samarans are concerned, I doubt very much whether they have said anything sensible (I have already had a letter about the accusation of “bourgeois sympathies”).
140 The question of “from whom we received the inheritance” is not the one I posed in my reply to Mikhailovsky—do we renounce that heritage “that Moskovskiye Vedomosti attacks” and which I gave an exact definition of? 141 If polemics were to be started against the Samarans on the fundamental ques-tion of the attitude of Marxism to the liberal-enlightener trends, and of the role and significance of the “extra-eco-nomic ” , it would be very interesting and useful.
All the best to you, Mark and Mitya, and many kisses for Mother.

144 I have never received the Ribot booklet that Anyuta promised; I am surprised at this and it is strange that Anyuta should single out the page on which the type is supposed to be the same as that used in the “markets”—page 24.
Is Ribot’s book set in different types? This book is of no importance to me in itself, by the way, since I hope to get the first batch of proofs soon.

Printed from the original78 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA February 28, 1899 Today we said “Good-bye” to our guests, Mother dearest; the people from Minusinsk came here—Gleb, Basil, Z.
P.
, local workers and others—and stayed here from Wednesday till today (Sunday).
We had an excellent time and are now returning to our usual tasks.
The Minusinsk people intend asking permission to come here for the summer; conditions are very bad in town in the summer.
I do not know, however, whether material circumstances may not keep them tied to the town.
If they can come here we shall be able to spend an excellent summer.
Elvira Ernestovna, Gleb tells us, is ill all the time.

did not come—she is acting as dis-trict nurse in the village of Kuraginskoye.

U.
Are you planning how to spend the summer and what are you thinking of doing? Anyuta, I have received the issues of Neue Zeit; 146 merci for them and for the agricultural returns, 147 and also for the clean proofs of “markets”.
I was very much pleased with the last.
You must have had a lot of trouble with them, but as a result there are practically no misprints.
I have not found any in the tables (although you write about them) and those in the letterpress are a mere bagatelle.
I think the type is satisfactory.
There will be about 30 printer’s sig-natures (that is the maximum, there will probably be fewer), just the number I counted on.
The tables have been set excellently.
It is particularly good that the decimal fractions stand out well and there are no tables printedsideways.
* The tables set in 6 point (p.
46) and in 5 point (p.
39) have come out very well—I could not wish for any-thing better.
149 The sub-titles and the numbers of the sections are all set in suitable type.
In short, on this occasion I have no reason to regret that the author cannot read the proofs.
In one of my next letters I shall send you a short list of my acquaintances to whom I should like you to send the book directly from Russia.
It would cost more to send a lot of copies to me and for me to send them from here, and it would be less convenient.
I hope that by the time you receive this letter you will have gone a long way past the second chapter, which, from the proof-reader’s point of view, is the most treacherous chapter.
I shall give the Preface a little more thought—perhaps I shall send another, or perhaps the old one can stay.
150 I am adding a list of misprints to this letter.
I have received Nauchnoye Obozreniye No.
1 with the article by P.
B.
Struve against Ilyin only from the Minusinsk peo-ple.

I do not know whether I can now write and quote from the “markets”, i.

14879 TO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW February 28, 1899 Mark, I received your letter of February 8.
Your chess game came in very handy.
The people from Minusinsk were here at the time as visitors and as they are now enthusiastic chess players we had some exceedingly tough battles.
We analysed your game, too.
Judging by that, you have begun to play much better.
You must have given much thought to each move and (perhaps?) consulted your neighbours.
Otherwise, you know, I shall now be afraid to play against a man who has defeated Lasker! 153 With regard to the “forces of the true believers” arrayed against me for my article on the “heritage” 1 5 4 —I await with interest something in the press about this.
The funda-mental question of “support” is, in my opinion, a very important one (in connection with the question of “econom-ics” and extra-economic relations.
By the way, do the forces connect the two issues?).
It would be very useful and very interesting to talk on this subject to people who do not limit themselves to Gvozdyov’s theories (have you road his book about kulaks? I think it is very, very weak * ).
We shall wait a while.
I read your remarks on the “markets” with great interest.
We shall see what sort of impression they produce as a whole—what the critics say, especially those who are to our way of thinking.
It is now impossible to correct the * See Letter No.

—Ed.
book (except in individual passages, of course), that is, it is impossible to change its general character, its laconic style (as it is there are about 500 pages! More would be absolutely impossible!)—masses of figures, tables, etc.
, and a narrow subject.
Only one correction would have been possible here—to divide the book into two parts or two volumes and spend a year or two on reworking each of them.
For various reasons I found this plan not very suit-able.
The question of foreign markets is touched upon in general terms only in Chapter VIII, in one § and in con-nection with the problem of the border regions of Russia.
In general I had to reject the examination of the foreign market completely.
I have not heard anything at all about your plans to leave your job.

6 Printed from the original80 TO HIS MOTHER * March 7, 1899 This week, Mother dearest, I have received three little books by Turgenev in German.
Merci for them.
I am glad you got the Reclaim edition—I think it is the most conve-nient.
I am now waiting for a dictionary from Russian into German (I remember we had two—Lenström and Reiff, an old dictionary from Russian.
The latter would be better, although the first of them is quite all right), and also some sort of a grammar.
I wrote about this to Anyuta; Mark has a Book about Books in which several detailed German gram-mars written in the German language are listed.
I wanted to order Pavlovsky’s Russo-German Dictionary from Kal-mykova but it seems that it is not finished and is being published piecemeal.
I am now finishing an article 155 in reply to Struve.
** It seems to me he has got things badly mixed up and his article may cause a good deal of misunderstanding among supporters and malicious glee among opponents.
If it is not possible to place the reply in the journal (for the simple reason that Tugan-Baranovsky or Bulgakov will get their answers in first; I still have not had the January issue of Nauchnoye Obozreniye) I think I shall include it in the “markets ” as a fourth Appendix (the article is no more than * An envelope addressed to Lenin’s sister Maria in Brussels in his mother’s band was attached to this letter.

Of course it would be better in the journal.
There are no changes here.
The weather is warm.
Spring is already making itself felt.
There is little good news from the comrades.
Apollinariya Alexandrovna was allowed to go to Yeniseisk for three weeks.

Your letter came just before our guests arrived.
We resolved to celebrate Shrovetide in style and invited everyone from the town (six people).
* Our quiet Shusha suddenly became crowded and noisy.
We spent the time in real holiday fashion and the five days passed before we realised it.
On the last day Mikhail Ale-xandrovich also came (he is now our nearest neighbour and we hope to see him often—he lives 35 versts from here).
After the visitors it took us all a long while to get back to normal again.
Volodya has immersed himself in an arti-cle in reply to Struve.
Still that eternally new question of the markets.
It looks as though Volodya will have to put in quite a lot of time on polemics in defence of the postulates made in his Studies.
He intends to write about Kablukov, too.
I have no regular occupation, I just read.
I have now been ten whole months in Shusha and have not managed to get anything done, I am always going to do something.
Spring is in the air.
The ice on the river is covered with water all the time and the sparrows in the willow trees are chirping furiously; the bullocks low as they pass up and down the street and the landlady’s hen under the stove * See Letter No.

—Ed.
clucks so loudly in the morning that she wakes everyone up.
The streets are muddy.
Volodya is more and more often thinking of his gun and waders, and Mother and I are thinking of planting some flowers.
From this descrip-tion you can get some idea of the way we pass our time and will realise that there is not a great deal of material here for letter-writing.
Judging by your letter, your life is the exact opposite of ours—there is life and movement all round you.
You seem to be entering into local life and to be full of its interests.
Thanks for the newspaper cuttings, send some more.
Your irritation at your lack of knowledge of French only impresses upon us the pitiful knowledge of languages that Volodya and I possess—his knowledge is a little better, but mine is very poor.
We have got hold of Turgenev in German and intend to start translating from Russian into German, but so far we have neither a diction-ary nor a grammar and, even if we had, it is hardly likely we should study.
Apparently we shall get to know languages only when we go abroad and necessity forces us to study them seriously.
When are you thinking of coming home? Will you have to take any examinations? Do you feel very homesick in Brussels? Have you many friends? Oh yes—did you know that Anatoly is very ill? The doc-tors have diagnosed consumption and he has a high tem-perature all the time.
Kuba was given permission to go to Yeniseisk for three weeks and she has gone there.
She writes rarely and only to clear her conscience, so I don’t know how she is getting on—probably not too well.
Zina is still the same as usual, merry and vivacious.
And so, good-bye.
Many kisses.

A very big merci for your photograph.
I think it came out quite well and I am all the more glad because the one I have is rather old.
It would be wonderful if you could visit us in Shusha.
In summer the journey is a rela-tively easy one—by rail to Krasnoyarsk and then by steam-er to Minusinsk (at the beginning of May the steamers do not usually go as far upstream as Minusinsk but in summer they go further, sometimes, though rarely, even to Shusha).
Shusha is not a bad place to stay in summer.
Gleb and Basil are applying for permission to be transferred here for the summer (summer in Minusinsk is very bad); I do not know whether permission will be given.

Anyuta, I have received the Izvestiya 156 —a big merci for it— and the clean proofs.
* By and large I am very pleased with them; the book is neatly printed, the tables are clear and without misprints, and very few of the tables are printed sideways.
But I don’t know about the diagram, how did that come out? I am sending you a list of the misprints in sig-natures 4 to 11.
A few of them (I have underlined them) either make reading difficult or distort the meaning (these are very few).
Perhaps it will be convenient for you to do this: in addition to the list of misprints at the end of the book you put in a special sheet at the beginning (it should be glued in) asking the reader to correct, before reading, the most important misprints, of which these (the ones I have underlined) are of significance, the remainder being given at the end of the book.
I believe this is sometimes done.
Since it is no use hoping for any book to appear without misprints, I can tell you (contrary to your expectations) that I feel fully satisfied.
As far as accuracy is concerned the Studies will not compare at all with this publication; there are few misprints and most of them are quite unim-portant.
As for the contents, do as you please; you may confine it to the section headings or add the detailed contents I have compiled.
157 I am sending a list of acquaintances to whom I would like you to send the book when it comes out.
Mitya will have plenty to do sending off such a heap of packages! But that is better than sending a lot here (three copies will be enough for me).
I am also sending a Postscript to the Preface.
If it is not too late I should very much like to print it, so as to make reference to Kautsky’s splendid book.
158 Perhaps it will be possible to set the Postscript, even if the Preface has already been set.
As soon as you receive this, write and * These were the proofs of Chapters II and III of The Development of Capitalism in Russia.

Why have they not paid any fee for it all this time, for, according to Nadya, it should have been paid irrespective of whether the book appeared or not.

Popova.
We are not writing to the writer about it because we think this question cannot really be dealt with in writing.

Thanks for the views of Brussels, although I do not want to think of foreign countries too soon, I do not even want to think about Russia.
All I allow myself to think about is the summer.
In her last letter to us, M.
Al.
wrote that she is coming to see us this summer with Anyuta, and today in a letter to Podolsk I plunged into a description of the charms of Shusha.
* I even outlined a trip to Lake Perovo, where we shall catch crucians and fry them.
You see, the Minusinsk crowd are asking to come to Shusha for the sum-mer, and we are thinking of acquiring a horse, so that it will be easy to go everywhere.
I have become quite a “patriot” and can talk with great enthusiasm about the Yenisei, the islands, the forest, etc.
All the same I am sorry I am not a man; I should wander around a lot more.
Although I should very much like to see you, I do not intend to tempt you with Shusha, because, speaking impartially, Shusha is a village like any other, and if I were asked today to choose between a place to spend the summer—near Moscow or in Shusha, I should choose the former.
* The letter has been lost.

Volodya is now greatly interested in Kautsky’s Agrar-frage and is writing a review of it.
* So far I can only glance at the book and lick my chops.
In general, we have quite a lot of books and the very abundance of them only makes one conscious of how much there is to be read and how little one reads.
We are not yet receiving Nachalo, so far only that boring Russkoye Bogatstvo.
However, I must stop.
Mother sends you kisses and con-gratulations.

It is an excellent likeness, isn’t it? Many kisses, Yours, Nadya March 17 I apologise, dear Manyasha, that this time, too, I am writing very little, just adding my congratulations to Na-dya’s.
The fact is that today a lot of letters have to be written to Turukhansk (the post goes once a month), 159 and then I have to send Anyuta a list of the misprints in the clean proofs she sent me.
We have very little news.
There is a lull in literary activity—we keep waiting.
Foreign newspapers write of events in St.
Petersburg and Finland (judging by Frankfurter Zeitung) but what they write is inked over, so we know very, very little.

Printed from the original84 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Vinogradov’s House, Bronnitskaya Street, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia March 21, 1899 I am sending you a note (or a review) on Kautsky’s book, Mother dearest; I would ask Anyuta to send it on.
I have not yet received the first issue of the journal.
* We hope to get it the day after tomorrow.
If Anyuta has not yet written anything to Manyasha about German books, is she going to write? If Manyasha is leaving soon, let her leave instructions at the post office to send books on to some other address (a friend’s, etc.
).
Perhaps Anyuta will also write to her about her own friends? If possible I should like to obtain the missing issues of Novoye Vremya for 1897-98.
Many kisses and regards to all.

Printed from the original85 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA April 4, 1899 I have received your letter and Mitya’s, Mother dearest.
There is no need for you to worry about a place to stay in Shusha, there is plenty of room here.
We had four visitors staying with us at Shrovetide.
If your health per-mits we should be very, very glad to see you, so as not to have to wait until my term is up (sometimes the term is extended—although I hope mine will not be).
Nadya is writing in greater detail, * but as regards the season I must make a correction to her letter, at the beginning of May the water is still low—the steamer put us ashore half way.
It is no good travelling an extra hundred versts by road.
The best thing is to reach Krasnoyarsk at the end of May, when you can easily go by boat as far as Minusinsk, and from there it is only 55 versts.
As a summer resort Shusha is not much worse than any other, I think (if worse it is).
It is only a question of the journey.
There is no need for you to be worried about the gun.
I am used to it and am very careful.
** Shooting is the only form of amusement here, and some sort of “loosen-ing up exercise” is necessary because of my sedentary life.
Thank Mitya for the trouble he took over the gun (which I have not yet received).
* See Krupskaya’s Letter No.

I read in Russkiye Vedomosti that Mark beat Chigorin! So that’s what he’s like! I’ll have to cross swords with him one day! Many kisses for you and regards to all.

They are for me; please ask Mitya to make a list of them and send it to me.
April 4, 1899 Anyuta, I have received Prakticheskaya Zhizn and Heyse’s German Grammar.
Many thanks for the latter, it is an excellent book.
I wrote you last time that I had received Tsion.
161 By the last post I sent a telegram to Petersburg in answer to the following, which I received on March 26.
“Proposed price of book two rubles, author’s royalties about 1,500 rubles, wire consent Kalmykova’s warehouse.
” * I gave my consent—because I cannot, after all, haggle by tele-graph—and on the eve of publication! How can I hold it up for that! Actually I am not much in favour of that “con-sent”.
I was rather surprised that they (who? I do not know, there is no signature) should have done things in a round-about way and, instead of asking you as the person in charge of the whole business, applied directly to me.
I now regret that I did not answer “ Apply to Yelizarova in Moscow, she is in charge of the affair.
” That is how I should have answered! Because 1,500 is very little for three years’ work, it works out at 50 rubles a printer’s signature.
Furthermore, since the Studies are selling exceedingly well there need be no worry about the “markets”.
If that is the case there is no reason for making the booksellers a present of 30 per cent.
One could, if the publisher were a more practical man or woman, offer the booksellers half that percentage and also sell the book through the Nachalo office, which, it is to be hoped, would not refuse.
By the * The telegram has been lost.
—Ed.
way, it is probably a waste of time writing all this now, since the deed seems to have been done.
Of course, we shall have to make concessions on the fees because of the cheap-ness of the book.
Since it is not we, but other people, who are publishing the book there is no sense in making special claims.
And so, all the preceding is merely platonic con-templation and not “business” propositions.
I believe it most probable that even the list of misprints in signatures 11 to 16 (I received them from you the day before yesterday) will be too late, so I am sending it only in case, and without making a fair copy.
* I have at last received issue No.
1-2 of Nachalo from comrades.
(Please subscribe to it for us, if you have not done so.
I did a very foolish thing in again relying on the écrivain.
I hope I shall not be so silly in the future.
) In general, I liked it very much, but B.
Avilov is rather weak, more scathing than sound.
162 Bulgakov simply made me mad; such nonsense, such utter nonsense, and such eternal professorial pretentiousness—what the devil is this?! 163 No wonder Syn Otechestva has already praised him! We’ll see how he finishes up.
I am thinking of writing “about Kaut-sky’s book and Bulgakov’s article”.
164 I have given up the plan to write about Kablukov, he is not worth a second article.
The écrivain, as usual, is silent, and we do not expect any information on journal affairs from him although we feel a considerable need for such information.

Printed from the original86 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA April 11, 1899 I received Mitya’s parcel on Tuesday, Mother dearest.
Send him a big merci for all his trouble.
I am pleased with the gun (the weather is bad at present; the usual spring squalls—strong winds from across the Yenisei; so there has been practically no shooting).
A charge of 2 w measures seemed too big (the gun kicks) and so I have begun using 2 2 measures.
I don’t understand how they could have used 3 in the shop! I have not yet been able to observe that the left barrel is better than the right—probably because I fired from too great a distance, 60 paces or so, about 30 sagenes.
If you come here bring some plain black tulle for mos-quito nets—I cannot go about here without a net.
The locality is rather swampy.
And also, please bring me anoth-er 200 wads for powder and for shot (similar to those Mitya sent me.
There are none to be had here, and they are light and easily packed).
At Easter I intend to make a shooting trip to a much better area.
Many kisses, Yours, V.
U.
(Next Sunday there will be no post on account of Easter.
Then the ice on the Yenisei may begin to move—it usually does soon after the twentieth of April.
There may be someinterruption of our correspondence; but you should not let that worry you.
Last year, I believe, there was practi-cally no interruption.
) Anyuta, I shall send to Mother’s address by the next post an article on Kautsky and Bulgakov.
Please send it on to the writer with a request that he inform you immediately whether the editors accept it.
I believe it quite possible that they may not do so, because the écrivain is probably on Bulgakov’s side and may find polemics inconvenient, especially sharp polemics.
As far as possible I tried to modify my tone but I was unable to speak coolly about that disgustingly professorial and clumsy article, which strikes a terribly dissonant note.
I do not, of course, want to res-trict the editors’ right to make “corrections”, but there is no need to write about this since it is understood, unless the author makes specific provisos.
If they do not accept the article, inform me, please, as quickly as possible and send the article, if you can, to.
Zhizn or Nauchnoye Obozre-niye [Mir Bozhy is hardly likely to accept it].
There has been no information from the writer on literary matters, and we do not hope for any.
Meanwhile it is devi-lishly inconvenient to write without constant and regular communication.
A long time ago, in January, I think, I wrote them (or Nadya wrote) that I intended doing an article about Kablukov; they did not inform me that they had another article.
* You hear nothing about reviews.
(The review of Kautsky’s book should be cancelled or sent somewhere else in view of this article against Bulgakov.
) You never know what they have and what they have not.
It would be a very good thing, if it were possible, to start a correspondence with the Chicagoan, who is in the know and probably has fairly close connections, so that he could answer all questions and in general keep you au courant with journal affairs.
I do not know whether this could be done.

How am I to send manuscripts if you (and Mother) go away? 165 In any case, leave the post office an address to which letters and parcels can be forwarded.

I am writing to Anyuta separately.
This year spring has come particularly early.
The trees are breaking into leaf and the water in the river is rising rapidly.
The steamer could no doubt get as far as Minusinsk already, but nobody can say definitely whether the high water will last and for how long.
Mikhail Alexandrovich (Silvin) wrote me that his fian-cée wants to visit him at the end of May (not earlier than the 23rd).
Her name is Papperek (Olga Alexandrovna), address, Yegoryevsk in Ryazan Gubernia (she teaches at a secondary school there).
If you decide to come, perhaps you could set out together.
In any ease it will provide a con-venient opportunity to send things.
Mikhail Alexandro-vich has asked her to call at Podolsk on the way, but you must, of course, get in touch with her because there may be circumstances that prevent her from doing so.
Yermakov-skoye (where M.

lives) is 40 versts from here, and the road there from Minusinsk is through Shushenskoye.

Many kisses and regards to all.
How are you fixed up now? How are you feeling? When are you expecting Manyasha? May 1, 1899 Anyuta, I have received your letter of April 12, my book and the Webb translation (three registered packages).
I am very pleased with the appearance of the book.
The publication is excellent thanks to the great trouble you took with the proofs.
It goes without saying that you did well to raise the price.
It is quite enough that there will be a 25 per cent discount for students.
Have you sent the book to all our acquaintances? I think you should take a further fifteen or so copies as the author’s reserve; we shall have to exchange them for various symposia, etc.
I have already written to you about the Studies and asked you to obtain a few more copies (send me two copies, but there is no hurry).
I am very pleased with the title of the book; the écrivain’s correction proved worth while.
If royalties arrive do not send them yet.
(I am writing to Mother about a good opportunity to send things here that will soon occur.
) I am willing to take the job of editing the Webb transla-tion.
I shall edit it in conformity with my own translation of the first volume.
Since I have been given the job of edit-ing there is nothing else to wait for, and the first volume should be sent to the press immediately, should it not? Or will that again depend on P.
B.
’s “preparations”? For the editing job the following are indispensable— (1) the English original of Volume (I have only Volume 1), (2) the German translation of Volume 2 (K.
Hugo, I have only Volume 1 although Volume 2 has also been published).
If these books have not yet been sent, please write quickly and tell them to send them immediately.
I am afraid this may also cause a delay.
Is it not possible to give someone the job of getting those books from them and sending them to me? 167 I did not very much like P.
B.
’s sending my reply to him on to Nauchnoye Obozreniye; is he trying to avoid polemics in Nachalo? 168 If he is, my article about Bulgakov willobviously not be published.
At last I have received Nacha-lo—two issues, complete.
By and large I liked it very much.
But Bulgakov’s article is outrageous.
Kautsky he distorts outright, and then there is that attack on Zusammenbruch169 —it is an echo of Bernstein’s “criticism” [the warehouse refused to send me Bernstein’s book; I have asked Manya-sha, but I do not know whether she will bring it.
Can you get it?] I am writing a second article against him.
* Of course, polemics among one’s own people are unpleasant and I tried to tone the article clown, but to keep quiet about differences is not only unpleasant, it is downright harmful— and, furthermore, one cannot keep quiet about the chief differences between “orthodoxy” and “criticism” that have come to the fore in German and Russian Marxism.
Our opponents are already taking advantage of the differences anyway (Mikhailovsky in Russkoye Bogatstvo No.
4).
While polemising among ourselves we can agree on general solidarity against the Narodniks.
I want to do this at the end of my article.
170 One of Bulgakov’s chief faults is that he did not say exactly in what he agrees with Kautsky against the Na-rodniks.

Printed from the original88 TO HIS MOTHER AND HIS SISTER ANNA Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Vinogradov’s House, Bronnitskaya Street, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia May 9, 1899 I have received a letter from Manyasha, Mother dearest, in which she says she is thinking of coming home soon.
I shall await news of what you decide to do about coming here.
For the last few days we have had what the Siberians call strong “weather”—by “weather” they mean the wind that blows from across the Yenisei, from the West; it is cold and violent, like a whirlwind.
In spring there are always whirlwinds that tear down fences, roofs and so on.
I was out shooting in the pine grove and I actually saw huge birches and pines being uprooted by a whirlwind.
Such unpleasant “weathers”, however, occur only in spring and autumn, and if there is a wind in summer it is not strong, so that should not cause you any alarm.
Today has been better—there seems to be a turn towards summer.
From mid-May to mid-August there is no reason to beware of Siberian “weather”.
Next Sunday I am sending to your address the manuscript of an article of mine * ; if you go away, arrange for it to be forwarded to its destination.

Anyuta, Today I finished my second article against Bulgakov.
When I have corrected and rewritten it I will send it to Mother’s address.
I am anxiously awaiting a reply about the first article; I should get it by the middle of May.
Many of the “ disciples ” 171 are going over to Zhizn.
Do you know who is actually the editor of it? There is a very interesting discussion going on now in Germany over Bernstein’s book—and I have not seen that book or anything written about it (with the exception of some casual notes in Frankfurter Zeitung).
A great pity.
Has Mitya sent my book to everybody on my list? If V.

was to send off some of them, please ask him if he has sent them to everyone.
P.

Lepeshinsky (Kuraginskoye, Minusinsk District, Yeniseisk Gubernia) wrote me, for instance, that he had not received the book, although he was on my list.

8 -9 Printed from the original89 TO HIS SISTER ANNA AND HIS MOTHER May 29, 1899 Anyuta, I have received your postscript to Mark’s letter.
You had not previously written to me about a proposal that I write a short course of political economy.
I have decided to refuse the offer; it is difficult to write to order (in particular, it is difficult to compete with Bogdanov.
Why not republish his book? 172 ), and it would be difficult to finish it by autumn.
In general, I want to write less and read more.
Since my correspondence with the écrivain has come to a complete halt, please let him know of my refusal.
I have not yet started on Webb.
I am still waiting for the original (of Volume 2) and the German translation (of Volume 2).
If there is a delay it will not be my fault.
There is more reason to fear a delay on the part of the écrivain, incidentally.
Is the first volume in the press? I learnt that a telegram had been sent me about the publication of the book only from your letter.
I am writing to the Minusinsk post office asking them to search for the telegram.
Was the address correct? You should write: “Minusinsk, to Shushenskoye by post, Ulyanov”, and pay seven or fourteen kopeks extra for postage.
If you did not add “by post”, it is possible that the telegram is still lying there.
In general, I have not noticed that the despatch of telegrams to this place is a hopeless undertaking; others have arrived in time.
You should send them so that they arrive in Minusinsk on Sunday or Wednesday evening and I will receive them on Tuesday or Friday morning.
I am sending the article on Sismondists that you asked for and the reply to Nezhdanov.
173 It would be most con-venient to print the latter in the same Zhizn.
* If, however, contrary to expectations Nachalo revives, I should prefer it in that journal.
I am now doing some reading and studying languages a little.
In general I am doing very little work and do not intend writing anything.
I am very sorry the écrivain did not write anything to me about Gvozdyov.
I wanted to curse him for all I was worth, but I saw that he was a contributor to the same journal and felt myself duty bound to be as gentle with him as possible.
It would have been strange to squabble in the same journal.
Perhaps the writer wanted to get rid of it— get rid of the “Gvozdyov school”, as I now call these things.
I do not know this and, in general, I do not know what sort of fellow Gvozdyov is.
It is difficult to judge from a distance.
Yours, V.
U.
May 30, 1899 I am sending you a registered package, Mother dearest, containing my article and a reprint of the article on the Sismondists that you asked for.
I am writing in greater detail to Anyuta and Mark, from whom I received a letter this week.

With regard to the statistical returns—from Tver and Vyatka—I think I have already written that there is no need to send them all to me; I am not working on this now and do not intend to until my term of exile is finished.
If any particular book is needed it will be better for me to order it separately, otherwise I shall have a mountain of books to bring back.
But you are probably sending only a few statistical returns.
Mikhail Alexandrovich writes that he does not expect his fiancée until the end of summer.
We do not think it worth while asking for a transfer to Krasnoyarsk.
We have been talking recently with Yeliza-veta Vasilyevna, who is thinking of asking for permission for me to go with them to Ufa this autumn because of the difficulty of a winter journey for her and Nadya.
If she carries out her intention I will let you know.
We have been paid our allowances.
We have news from Yermakovskoye that Anatoly is no better.
We have also heard that Lyakhovsky has made a trip to Chita as a doctor.
It is a pity you are having such bad weather and have no opportunity for a good rest in the country.
June has been rainy here, too.
Life here goes on as usual.
I am not working much at present and soon, when the shooting season opens, I shall probably work even less.
I have received the May issue of Nachalo—pretty badly cut up.
I do not think there is anything of particular interest in it.
I am losing all hope of that journal regaining its health.
I have had a letter telling me that the Ministry of the Interior has demanded that the editors reveal the names of the authors who wrote in the first and in the April issues under pseudonyms.
It would be interesting to know whether we have any mutual acquaintances among the “revealed”.
Many kisses for you and regards to all.

U.
Mitya, I have seen Nauchnoye Obozreniye No.
5 and find that Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in it is monstrously foolish and nonsensical; he has simply arbitrarily introduced changes into the rate of surplus value in order to “refute” Marx; he assumes an absurdity—a change in the productivity of labour without a change in the value of the product.
I don’t know whether every such nonsensical article is worth writing about.
Let him first fulfil his promise to develop it in detail.
175 In general I am becoming a more and more determined opponent of the latest “critical stream” in Marx-ism and of neo-Kantianism (which has produced, inciden-tally, the idea of separating sociological from economic laws).
The author of Beiträge zur Geschichte des Materialis-mus* is quite right in declaring that neo-Kantianism is a reac-tionary theory of the reactionary bourgeoisie and in rebelling against Bernstein.
I am extremely interested in Bogdanov’s new book (Osnovniye elementy istoricheskogo vozzreniya na prirodu, St.
Petersburg, 1899) and have ordered it; the review of it in the May issue of Nachalo was written ridicu-lously, with pompous phrases but no mention of the real problem.
I am very sorry that I somehow missed the adver-tisement of the book when it was published.
I think it should be a sensible book and that such a review should not be left unanswered.

We have put off the journey to Minusinsk for a while.
Perhaps we shall go for a short time this week.

Manyasha, I recently read Stammler’s book here, in German, and felt very dissatisfied with it.
In my opinion it is learned nonsense and fruitless scholasticism.
It would be interest-ing to know who praised it to you.
It is true that Struve and Bulgakov, both of whom, like Stammler, take a stand on neo-Kantianism, 178 praised it in Novoye Slovo.
Stammler in my opinion is an excellent argument against neo-Kantian-ism.
To attempt to fight Marxism armed with nothing but foolishly compiled definitions in the way Stammler does (he has never written anything but textbooks for students of Roman Law.
.
.
) is too absurd an undertaking.
It was correctly said in Neue Zeit (Cunow) that Stammler’s book is of negative significance.
A few days ago I received the April issue of Nachalo and read almost all of it.
It is very interesting in general and the article “Out of Turn” in particular.
Webb (the original) we have still not received! It seems I shall have to postpone it till my return since I can get nothing done.
I have read P.
N.

95 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Cottage No.
3, Town Park, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia August 22, 1899 The day before yesterday I received your letter, Mother dearest, letters from Anyuta and Manyasha, a book from Anyuta (Nauchnoye Obozreniye) and cuttings from Manya-sha.
Merci for everything.
I was terribly pleased to know that you are up and about again.
What caused the epidemic of malaria in Podolsk? Is it a swampy place? Do you feel quite well now? It looks like being a good autumn here, dry and warm.
What is it like where you are? Letters sent by express train do not seem to come any quicker than those sent by ordinary mail, which surprises me very much.
I received your letter of August 7 on the 20th (and on the same day I also received the newspaper of the 7th).
Is the delay not caused by the express train taking letters to Krasnoyarsk (at any rate the envelope bears the stamp “Krasnoyarsk 14.
VIII”) and from there a letter goes back to Achinsk (the post road is from Achinsk to Minusinsk)? Either this train does not stop at Achinsk or the mail is not taken off it there.
That must be the reason, because letters go quickly from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk (from 7th to 14th) but the gain is lost on the way back from Krasnoyarsk to Achinsk.
As far as the transfer is concerned, we only talked about it but did not submit any applications.
We do not think it worth while applying—we will wait until January 29, 1900.
Life here goes on as usual.
The weather is fine and Nadya and I go walking a lot.
We are all in good health.
I embrace you, Mother dearest, and hope you will keep well.
Yours, V.

8 -9 Printed from the original96 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA August 22 I received your letter long ago, dear Manya, but I have been terribly lazy lately and have got all behind with my letter-writing; there are several letters I must answer.
It must be due to my present way of life; I spend whole days (as much as five hours at a time) out walking, some-how it is even difficult to read.
The summer was foul, but autumn so far has been marvellous.
Volodya also does a lot of walking, but he still does some work, although far less than before.
What have you decided? When are you leaving and where are you going? When I read your letter to Volodya in which you asked him what institution you should enter, I remem-bered what a quandary I was in at your age.
First I decided to become a village schoolmistress, but I was unable to find a place and wanted to go to the provinces.
Then when the Bestuzhev courses were started I joined them, expecting to be told about everything I was interested in, but when they began to talk about something quite different I left.
In short, I was in a hopeless quandary.
I was twenty-one before I heard that there was such a thing as the “social sciences”; up till then my idea of serious reading had been either the natural sciences or history, and so first I would try to read Rossmässler, then the history of Philip II of Spain.
You are placed in very different circumstances.
Whether it is worth while learning “how to make a living”, I don’t know; I think it is not worth while.
If money is needed you can get a job on some railway, where at least you will be able to work off the necessary number of hours and haveno cares, you will be as free as a bird; but all this pedagogy, medicine and so on absorbs a person more than it should.
It is a pity to waste time on special training when there is so much you want to know and should know, and, after all, your knowledge of languages will always feed you.
Volo-dya and I are in trouble with languages; we both are rather bad at them; we take a lot of trouble over them, but we are still not good.
We have taken up English again.
How often we have done so before! I am beginning for the tenth time, at least.
You are probably far ahead of me by now.
Anya knows English quite well, doesn’t she? But I keep forgetting to ask you whether you have made the acquaint-ance of Meshcheryakov? I believe he is in Moscow now.
He is as much in love with Belgium as you are.
At one time I corresponded with him, and I then had a good knowl-edge of all Belgian affairs and was very interested in them.
If you see him, try to find out where his wife is.
A friend of hers wrote me that she had gone to Munich.
I should be sorry to lose touch with her.
She is a very nice person.
I don’t know whether we shall ever meet again.
All my St.
Petersburg acquaintances have been so scattered in all directions that I don’t know who is where.
At first we wrote to one another, but now our correspondence is gradually drying up.
It is no good writing letters, you can never really discuss anything, and you begin .
.
.
the result is that before you know where you are a misunder-standing arises.
I do not know how Kuba is getting on, she wrote little, but it looked as if her nerves were giving out.
But I have written so much there will be no space left for Volodya, so I had better stop.
Many kisses for you, Maria Alexandrovna and Anyuta.
Mother sends regards to all.
All the best, Nadya August 22, 1899 I was very pleased, Manyasha, when I read that at last you had got Bernstein for me; 180 I have been and still am waiting very impatiently for it.
People have written to me from Yakutia that they are reading Bernstein and wehave not yet got it here! The more they shout about him, and the more various thick-headed bourgeois and “young ” (in all respects) non-bourgeois make use of him, the more necessary it is to make the speedy acquaintance of this “newest” hero of opportunism.
On October 9, 1899 (N.
S.
) there will be a Parteitag * in Hanover and they will talk about Bernstein.
181 I should very much like to have reports of it.
Please try to get them for me; it is quite possible to do so in one of the following ways.
Write to your acquaintances abroad (I ask Anya to do this, too) to send those issues of the newspapers in which the reports are printed, even if it is only Frankfurter Zeitung, which can enter Russia.
If the acquaintances do not under-take to send either Vorwärts 182 or Frankfurter Zeitung, perhaps you can subscribe to Frankfurter Zeitung for Octo-ber through the Moscow post office.
(I know you can subscribe for three months, but that is too long and too expensive, 4 rubles 70 kopeks.
Perhaps you can subscribe for a month?) If you are abroad yourself, then please buy those issues and send them.
I am not sending you any literary jobs because I am not writing anything now and do not intend to write.
But if you go abroad I shall probably ask you to look out for some good old books for me.
All the best, V.

Printed from the original97 TO HIS MOTHER August 25, 1899 Last Sunday we returned home, Mother dearest, and got a letter from Manyasha with newspaper cuttings (a big merci for them), and then Neue Zeit from Anyuta and reprints (2) of my articles against Levitsky.
183 I was particu-larly glad to receive them.
Anyuta wrote that you are still undecided whether to come here or not, and that you would come if you were sure the boat would take you to Minusinsk and back.
When we read that, we decided to send you a telegram saying that the boats run until the middle of September (last year a boat took me as far as Minusinsk after the twentieth—of course, it was the last), so you would have time to come if you have fully regained your health and Mitya’s case permits it.
I hope you receive the telegram sent on the 22nd in good time.
In reply to it we shall await either you in person or a letter.
Up to now (for two years) autumn here has been fine, but I don’t know what it will be like this year after a rainy summer.
Of the books sent by Anyuta I am particularly glad to have Mehring; I have just finished reading the second volume and am very, very satisfied.
As far as the Credo der Jungen * is concerned, I was amazed at the emptiness of the phrases.
It is not a Credo but a pitiful collection of words! I intend to write in greater detail about it.
The writer’s silence is exasperating.
He does not send Webb.
He does not publish articles about the “markets”, * The creed of the young (Ger.
).
—Ed.
and nothing has been seen or heard about the anti-Bulga-kov article.
I think you should take back all the manuscripts and send them in to editorial offices yourselves so as to get precise and timely answers regarding whether they will be published, and to have direct contact.
It is, of course, in-convenient for me to do it myself, but Anyuta could do it, I think, if other affairs do not prevent her from giving her time to it; it would be better to send them direct than to send them through the writer.
If he has held up my article against him merely because he has not yet finished his own answer to it-that is simply swinish on his part! It is useless for me to write to him, because he does not answer.
Many kisses for you and regards to all.

8 -9 Printed from the original98 TO HIS MOTHER September 1, 1899 I did not manage to write to you on Sunday, Mother dearest, and am writing in the middle of the week.
Yesterday we received books by Bernstein and Vander-velde * and two issues of Moskovskiye Vedomosti—Bernstein was wrapped in one of them—and half another issue (No.
223) came in a separate packet, which surprised us more than a little.
Has something been lost, or has there been a mis-take? As regards Bernstein—I have decided that I may consid-er it mine; Manyasha did not say exactly that she wants it back by a certain date, but wrote that she is taking steps to obtain another copy.
I need that book very much.
If, contrary to expectations, Manyasha needs the copy she sent me, she should write to me about it immediately.
Nadya and I started reading Bernstein’s book immediate-ly; we have read more than a half and its contents aston-ish us more and more as we go on.
It is unbelievably weak theoretically—mere repetition of someone else’s ideas.
There are phrases about criticism but no attempt at serious, independent criticism.
In effect it is opportunism (or rather, Fabianism—the original of many of Bernstein’s assertions and ideas is to be found in the Webbs’ recent books), unbounded opportunism and possibilism, and cowardly opportunism at that, since Bernstein does not want to attack the programme directly.
There is little doubt but what it * It is not known which of Vandervelde’s books is referred to here.
—Ed.
will be a fiasco.
Bernstein’s statement that many Russians agree with him .

(pp.
170 and 173, footnotes) made us very indignant.
We people here must indeed be getting “old” and must be “lagging behind” the “new words” .

copied from Bernstein.
I shall soon be writing to Anyuta on this subject in detail.
* Yesterday (at long last!) we received Webb, Volume II in English (no German—we are asking for it today)— without any letter or news about the first volume! I now find that it is essential to make a few changes and add something to my article against Bulgakov.
I will do this in thorough copy I have here.
I ask Anyuta to demand the immediate return of the second article and to keep it until she receives my corrections.
184 We have little news.
Anatoly gets worse and worse.
Gleb is leaving soon for Nizhneudinsk (Irkutsk Gubernia) to work on the railway.
Yelizaveta Vasilyevna yesterday received a money order for 100 rubles.

I have found out that the Frankfurter Zeitung is delivered to someone not far from here, so you need not subscribe to it.
I ask Manyasha to obtain for me (order from Dresden or try to find them among acquaintances) issues of the Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung for 1898 (1) contain-ing Parvus’s articles against Bernstein and (2) issues Nos.
253, 254 and 255 for 1898.

Printed from the original99 TO HIS MOTHER September 11, 1899 I have very sad news for you, Mother dearest.
Anatoly died on September 8, and on September 10 we buried him at Yermakovskoye.
There bad been no hope of his recovery for a long time past and the disease had been developing terribly fast lately.
His wile is staying in Yermakovskoye for the time being.
There is a threat that Mikhail Alexan-drovich Silvin will be recruited for the army; he has received a notice to report in Minusinsk and is going there on Sep-tember 14.
If he is taken, he will have to serve two years— two months more than his term of exile.
Nadya and I have now got down to the second volume of Webb without waiting either for the proofs of the first volume (which would be very useful in editing the transla-tion of the second volume) or the German translation of Volume II.
The job will probably take quite a long time.
I am sending you with this letter a registered packet containing the corrections to my article about Bulgakov.
I ask Anyuta to transfer these corrections to the manuscript (cutting out the old and pasting in the new) and to get in touch with the editors about its publication.
I should like to know the fate of the article as soon as possible.
We are all well.
Many kisses, my dear, and regards to all.

8 -9 Printed from the original100 TO HIS MOTHER October 17, 1899 This week I have received a lot of interesting things from home, Mother dearest, and send you many thanks for them all.
I was very glad to make the acquaintance of the new French journal, which promises to be very interesting; the mere fact of its appearance under the editorship of Longuet is noteworthy.
186 I am finishing reading the Stut-tgart minutes, also with considerable interest.
And then, the booklet on the professional congress in Moscow (which I received on Friday) was also very interesting and instructive.
187 There is a lull in the literary news.
I believe I have al-ready written about reading of the publication of Volume I of Webb and ordering one for myself because they appar-ently think it superfluous to send me one.
I have heard about a new St.
Petersburg paper—Severny Kuryer 188—and intend to order it as soon as I see announcements in the press.
Yuly wrote to me from Turukhansk that a lengthy article by M.
Engelhardt had been published in Novosti; it was called “The Cards Are Being Revealed” and it sim-ply tore Ilyin’s book on capitalism to pieces.
It would be interesting to read it if finding and purchasing that partic-ular issue in Moscow would not be too much trouble.
I rarely see Zhizn; the seventh issue was sent to me quite unexpectedly direct from St.
Petersburg, maybe even direct from the editorial room (sic!!??!!).
Comrades sometimes send me Nauchnoye Obozreniye; people living near here whom I am sometimes able to meet receive it.
There have been no changes here.
How have you fixed yourselves up in Moscow? Who is going abroad, Anya or Manyasha, and when? Did you leave Mitya alone in Podolsk? Many kisses for you and regards to everybody.

We have plenty of warm clothes so I don’t suppose we shall freeze, and the weather seems to be getting warmer; yesterday Oscar saw a cloud somewhere and the temperature this morning was only 28° below.
The worst of it, is that Mother keeps catch-ing colds and is coughing again.
Volodya and I go out every day, despite the frosts; we have become accustomed to fresh air but I don’t know how Mother will make the journey.
Still, I wish the 29th would come soon; once we are going we might as well go.
The day of our departure seems to be so close that today Mother wanted to start making pelmeni * to take with us.
We have been advised to take pelmeni to eat on the way, everything else spoils in the frost.
Mother intends making mountains of the stuff, with no fat or onions.
We are not doing much reading now.
Volodya, inciden-tally, is writing a reply to Skvortsov.
1 9 0 We shall send Webb off today, at long last; he has made us thoroughly tired of him, I must say.
Well, good-bye.

103 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Kedrova’s House, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia April 6, 1900 Today I received a letter from Manyasha (dated April 3), Mother dearest, in which she reproaches me for my silence.
I really am at fault, I did not even congratulate you and Manyasha on April 1.
The fact is that at that time I was once again “in a whirl” (as Nadya put it in a letter to the Siberian comrades) over the arrival of a long-expected traveller * (who has by now most likely arrived home).
Life goes on here as usual, I am quite well and today tried doing without my “waters”.
I take walks—walking is not at all bad here at present and, it seems, there are plenty of nice places in Pskov (and also in its environs).
I have bought some postcards with views of Pskov in a local shop and am sending three of them—to you, Manyasha and Anyuta.
** Yesterday I received a letter from M.
A.
, who writes (on April 4) that he is going back to Siberia (with O.

Nadya is most probably in bed; the doctor finds (as she wrote in a letter a week ago) that her illness (gynaecolo-gical) needs persistent treatment and she must remain in bed for anything from two to six weeks.
(I have sent her some more money—I received 100 rubles from Vodovozova— because her treatment will entail considerable expense.
So far I have enough money, but if I run short I shall write to you.
) So she would not be able to come to me now, even if she had permission (I still have no reply and have almost given up expecting one).
I am thinking of going to visit her in the spring, in about six weeks—or perhaps earlier.
An acquaintance of mine here * has applied for a passport and is thinking of going abroad for a cure after April 20; I shall be rather lonely here without him.
I am taking lessons in German from a local German at 50 kopeks a lesson.
We translate from Russian and talk a little—there is not much progress and I am wondering whether I should not give it up; for the time being, however, I shall continue.
I am not working very much and have still not finished the Index to Webb.
I go to the library and read the newspapers.
I see very few new books, I have not seen Davydov’s.
** I do not intend to answer P.

106 TO HIS MOTHER May 5, 1900 Your letter of the 2nd with Manyasha’s postscript, I received only today, Mother dearest.
I do not know why the letter was delayed (you expected me to receive it on the 3rd or not later than the 4th); it is postmarked “Mail train 2nd” and “Pskov 4th”, so there does not seem to have been any real delay; the letter arrived in Pskov on the 4th and was delivered this morning.
A letter is not likely to reach me as quickly from Podolsk as from Moscow.
There is no need for you to worry about me, Mother dear-est.
My health is much better, I gave up taking the mineral water a long time ago and have never felt any desire or need to return to it.
Yesterday I received a certificate from the local Chief of Police to the effect that he has no objection to my making a journey abroad; today I paid the stamp duty (ten rubles) and in two hours’ time I shall receive my passport.
And so I shall be moving to warmer parts in sum-mer; I cannot leave here immediately because there are some matters I must settle with editors and with certain publishers of translations and also wind up some financial affairs (I hope, by the way, to get a few coppers from Fi-lippov; if I get none, either from him or Popova, I will write and ask you to send me something).
I must, moreover, wait here for an answer to my request to the Department for permission to live in Ufa for six weeks on account of my wife’s illness.
I submitted the request on April 20 and there should be an answer in about a week.
I shall definitely visit Nadya, but I still do not know whether I shall be able to live with her for six weeks or whether (which is the more probable) I shall have to make do with a shorter period.
In any case the receipt of the passport (I have to receiveit here in Pskov, my last place of residence) does not restrict me because the law says that I may go abroad any time within three months on a passport issued in the interior gubernias, so that I shall not be late oven if I leave Russia on August 5.
I am therefore leaving here between the 15th and the 20th, as I wrote you before; I shall try to leave earlier, of course.
Please write and tell me what to do with my things; shall I leave them in Moscow (is Mark there and what is his address? will he be in Moscow long? does he visit you often?) or bring them straight to Podolsk (I don’t know if that will be convenient; I suppose I shall have to take everything with me, including books), and I should like Manyasha to write me in detail how to find you in Podolsk.

I am very glad permission has been granted for me to visit you and it goes without saying that I shall certainly take advantage of it; unfor-tunately I cannot leave here at once; I do not want to come back here, so I must stay on for 5-7 days or so to settle some financial affairs and certain editorial business.
It doesn’t matter, of course, whether I come a week earlier or later; I am, in general, in agreement with the arguments put forward by you and Anyuta (by the way—merci for the work on urban statistics which I received today) and think of doing as you advise, the only thing is I must give up the idea of a personal visit to St.
Petersburg and shall, there-fore, ask you to go, if you can manage it, by Thursday the 18th, or, if you can’t, by Thursday the 25th, depending on when we meet.

Printed from the original109 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Kedrova’s House, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia July 2, 1900 Mother dearest, Unfortunately I have to tell you that our meeting has to be postponed for a time.
I must pay a short visit to a comrade in Siberia, 199 so I shall not be passing through Podolsk before the 20th or 21st (most likely the 20th, I think).
Then all I shall have to do is get my things together, get visas in my passport and continue on my way.
If the things have not yet arrived, I would ask Mitya to take the most energetic measures, up to and including a personal trip.
Our people are all well and send their regards.
I embrace you fondly, Mother dearest, and send regards to all.
Yours, V.

201 I am well and am having a good time; I saw Anyuta a few days ago, * took a trip on a very beautiful lake with her and enjoyed the wonderful views and the good weather—there has not been much good weather here either, mostly rain and thunderstorms.
It’s as bad a summer here for tourists as it is in Russia.
Many kisses for you and regards to all.
I ask Manyasha to send me as soon as possible all the books there are for me; as regards the boxes—I hope to write soon.
Yours, V.
U.
You may write to me at the same address (or to Anyuta to forward to me, although that is slower than if letters are sent to Paris).

111 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Kedrova’s House, Podolsk, Moscow Gubernia, Russia Paris, 202 September 7, 1900 I received Manya’s letter and postcard, Mother dearest, and was glad to have news from home.
I returned from my Rhine trip several days ago, I am not thinking of stay-ing here for long, and shall probably be moving on soon.
I don’t know where yet, but will write when it is certain.
Manyasha grumbles at the shortness of my letters; I admit my guilt, but by way of justification must say that here you are in a whirl all the time and there is such a wealth of impressions that it is difficult to choose what to dwell upon and describe in greater detail.
I hope that when I leave here, when I am farther away from the turmoil of the exhibition with its peculiar exhibition atmosphere, I shall be able to concentrate better and write more clearly.
Until then, please excuse me for the emptiness of my letters.
Many kisses for you, my dear, and regards to all.
Yours, V.

Manyasha says nothing about your health; I hope that means you are well.
How are Mitya’s affairs going? When is Mark moving, and when will you all be in Moscow? What do you know about Manyasha’s case? 203 Sent from Munich First published in 1 9 2 9 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.

S.
), 1900 Yesterday (no, not yesterday—the 16th) I received your letter of August 23, Mother dearest, and was very glad to get it.
I have also received Manyasha’s first letter and her postcard of August 24 saying that another letter with a reminder had come from the carrier’s.
204 I have already sent Manyasha an address which she should pass on to them.
I hope she has received it.
It is a great pity that Mitya has been refused admission to the University.
It is a hell of a business, having to lose another year! Perhaps it can still be managed with the help of one of those guarantors you mention.
Manyasha’s posi-tion also seems to be indefinite, doesn’t it? I got a letter from Anyuta yesterday and hope to see her soon—we do a great deal of walking together.
I intend taking the waters again soon and being more regular with the cure.
The weather here is good now; the rainy days are over and it looks as if we shall be able to do some good walking.
I have plenty of shirts and underclothes and money, Mother dearest, so there is no need to send anything for the time being; I hope I shall not have to write about this in the near future, and I shall try to reckon up in advance when the necessity arises.
I also got a letter from Nadya yesterday; she says they are fixed up quite well, she has heaps of lessons that keep her busy seven hours a day!I embrace you fondly, Mother dearest, and send my regards to all.
I hope you will soon be able to make final arrangements for the winter and will have better accom-modation.
Yours, V.

There’s one thing I almost forgot to add—on September 17 (that will be the 4th by our calendar) I received Braun’s Archiv that I had left behind.
It was done very quickly! A big merci to Manyasha.

I was very glad to learn that Mitya’s affairs are being settled, and that he will probably be allowed to enter Yuriev University.
205 It would be fine if he could get everything settled soon! What is happening to Ma-nyasha’s case? She doesn’t write about it.
How are you? Are you comfortable? I am now quite well, I got over my influenza long ago and am working more regularly.
We are having excellent weather here— and you? I have also received the books from Manyasha (Bulletin officiel), thanks for them.
I am expecting the box and money to arrive soon.

1 1 Printed from the original114 TO HIS SISTER MARIA Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, * Sharonov’s House, Bakhmetyevskaya Street, 25, Moscow, Russia November 6, 1900 Manyasha, I have received your letter, Manyasha, many thanks for it.
I received the books a few days ago and was horrified when I opened the big box.
It contained the medical books of an Anna Fedulova (from Barnaul in Siberia) who had studied in Lausanne and Geneva from 1893 to 1899.
How absurd and disgraceful! I know nothing about this person and hear her name for the first time.
How could her books have got here? How could they have been sent to Moscow to the wrong address? Why did nobody enquire about them during the months they were lying in Moscow? Try to find out, if you can, what it is all about.
For all the books I paid about 40 (forty!) rubles.
So for someone else’s books I must have overpaid about thirty rubles on account of the neglect of some utterly irresponsible persons.
I shall write to Siberia and to Switzerland, asking them to try and find the lady.
In the meantime I have put the books into a warehouse.
I must get in touch with the * The first part of the letter, written to Lenin’s mother, has been lost.
—Ed.
carrier’s office that sent the box.
Let me have their exact address.
Perhaps the owner of the books will soon be asking for them.
Did they issue a receipt for the books? If so, how could they have surrendered them (here) without it? Try and go to them to get an explanation, or—better—write to then, register the letter and send a stamp for a reply.
(1 think the owner of the books should refund my expenses since she is at fault for sending the books to a strange address without any notification.
) I have received a letter from Lirochka, who sends you and Mother thousands of the warmest greetings.
I do not suppose I shall have an opportunity to see her.
I have, received my books in good order—merci for them.

Thanks.
I did not receive your previous letter, so I don’t know how to send the medical books.
To whom? To the owner of the books? Can you not get the money they cost from her in advance? I am quite well and life goes on as usual.

1 1 Printed from the original116 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Sharonov’s House, Bakhmetyevskaya Street, Moscow, Russia December 6, 1900 Mother dearest, A few days ago I received the letters forwarded to me by Manyasha.
Merci for them.
I do not know whether I shall soon get round to sending a reply to Siberia—I have also had a letter lying here unanswered for a long time.
Yesterday I had a letter from Anyuta.
She writes that she does not yet know how long she will be in Paris.
You have probably received letters from her, too.
Are you expecting Mitya home for the holidays? How is be getting on with his medicine and German? What sort of weather are you having? You probably have a fine winter.
Here we have slush and autumn rain— if the whole “winter” is going to be like this it will be worse than frost and snow.
It is true that there are occasionally some very fine days, when it is dry and clear—but only by way of exception.
Where does Mark intend spending his vacation? In Mos-cow, or will he go away somewhere? How is Manyasha getting on? Isn’t she working too much? Is she quite well again now? Perhaps it would do her good to run around more, that is, to walk from one partof the town to another.
Anyuta writes that Manyasha may come here with Nadya.
Life goes on here as usual.
I am wandering aimlessly in a strange land and still only “hoping” to put an end to the fuss and bother and settle down to work.
Nadya writes often.
She is well, but Y.

Tomorrow I am having the box mended—it has suffered from long journeys and I cannot risk sending it like that-and will then forward it through some carrier’s office.
I will send the receipt by registered letter direct to Fedulova and will write to you when it has been sent.

Mitya did well to claim the money from the railway.
Of course it could not be ignored.

All best wishes and may you have a good time; perhaps Mitya will come and you will all get together—at least everyone who is in Russia.
Anya and I also thought of get-ting together, but we could not manage it.
Here it is already Weihnachten * —Christbäume ** everywhere and the streets have been unusually lively over the last few days.
I went to Vienna a few days ago and enjoyed the journey after several weeks of immobility.
208 But a winter without snow is unpleasant.
Actually there is no winter at all, it is like a rotten autumn; everything wet and dripping.
It is a good thing it is not cold and I can manage quite well without a winter overcoat, but somehow it’s not very nice without snow.
I am fed up with the slush and recall with pleasure the real Russian winter, the sleigh rides and the clean frosty air.
I am spending my first winter abroad, the first winter that is nothing at all like a winter, and I cannot say that I have been very pleased, although at times there * Christmas (Ger.

are fine days like those we have at home in late autumn, when the weather is good.
There has been no change in my way of life; it is rather lonely and, unfortunately, rather purposeless.
I keep hoping to arrange my studies more systematically but I don’t seem to manage it.
In spring things will certainly go better and I shall get “on to the rails”.
Since my Shushenskoye immobility I have done a lot of wandering through Russia and abroad and am now longing for some peaceful writing again; it is only the unaccustomed foreign atmosphere that prevents me really getting down to it.
Are you keeping well, Mother dearest? Are you not lone-ly without Anyuta? How is Manya’s case coming along? By the way, I forgot to tell her that I have received Push-kin and am very grateful, and that I also got her letter of December 6.
I have not answered because of my journey, and since then I have been very busy.

It is a pity it is so terribly cold; when I tell the Germans (or the Czechs) about a temperature of 28° below zero Réau-mur they simply gasp and wonder how the Russians man-age to stay alive.
Here 8° or 10° below zero R is considered cold, furchtbare Kälte* and almost everybody manages with only an autumn coat (admittedly most of them wear woollen jerseys as well).
The houses here are not at all adapted to severe cold, the walls are thin, the windows are not caulked up tight and very often there are not even Winterfenster.
** You have no need to worry about me; I eat well at a board-ing-house where I have been staying since autumn.
I feel quite well, probably because I run around a lot more than I sit still.

Thanks for everything.
I was very glad to get Mitya’s photo—I think it is a good one.
I have already begun to long for photographs and will certainly ask Nadya to bring my album, and if you have any new photographs, please send them.
I don’t need any warm clothing now.
Winter here seems to be over—I mean real winter with snow and temperatures below zero.
It was warm and rainy right up to the end of December.
Then it snowed and the temperature began to drop to 10°-15° below zero R (mornings) and the Germans complained of the “terrible” cold.
In their houses it really is terribly cold, even when there are only three degrees of frost outside; the houses are badly built.
A thaw set in about a week ago, all the snow disappeared in one night, and the weather is now like March in Russia or April in Siberia.
It is possible—even probable—that there will be some more snow, but only for a very short time.
The coldest period is over; last month I had to spend five rubleson Holz und Kohle * instead of one or two rubles, as in pre-vious months.
I am quite well and there are no changes.
I correspond with Anyuta and hope to see her soon.

Printed from the original122 TO HIS MOTHER Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, Sharonov’s House, Bakhmetyevskaya Street, Moscow, Russia February 9, 1901 Mother dearest, How are you? What news is there, what does Mitya write from Yuriev—he is probably working hard now the exami-nations are drawing near.
I recently received some old manuscripts from Manyasha and the Vienna gifts.
210 A big merci for them.
The weather here is again turning wintry, i.
e.
, there has been some snow.
It is not cold, however, and the snow melts during the day.
I was at the opera a few days ago and heard La Juive with the greatest pleasure; I heard it once in Kazan (when Zakrzhevsky sang)—that must be thirteen years ago, and some of the tunes have remained in my memory.
The music and singing were good.
I have also been to theatres (German) on a few occasions and sometimes understood something, the general idea, at any rate.
Do you go to the Moscow theatres? Anyuta wrote recently that her work will detain her for a while yet.
Are you thinking of applying for permission for Nadya to visit you, my dear, just for a few days? She would prob-ably like that very much, but the metropolitan cities areusually forbidden—after Ufa, 211 she writes, they are the only prohibited places.
I should like Manyasha to drop me a line saying when she subscribes to magazines for me, so that I know when to ask for them at the post office.

The only news I have had was from Manyasha, sent on the 6th, and for that many thanks.
How are you? Not freezing too badly? Are you keeping well? It is cold here again, and there has been so much snow— more than for the last 13 years—so people say.
There have been cases of trains being held up by snowdrifts.
But it seems to be winter’s last effort.
I am used to it by now and have adapted myself to the local winter—nevertheless if I have to spend the next winter in these parts I shall write for a quilted coat.
Without it you either have to wear a woollen jersey or put on two sets of underclothes (as I do).
At first it was not very comfortable but I got used to it long ago.
And in any case the cold here is not like the Russian cold.
If it’s 10° below zero that’s a “terrible frost”.
The carnival ended here a few days ago.
This is the first time I have seen the last day of a carnival in a foreign country—processions of people in fancy dress, general buffoonery, showers of confetti (tiny scraps of coloured paper) thrown in your face, paper streamers and so on.
People here do know how to make merry publicly, in the streets! I am quite well, probably because I run about rather a lot, and do not sit still for long.
In general life is much the same.
Nadya’s term of exile will soon be over (March 24 by the calendar here, March 11 by yours).
In a day or two I shall send an application for a passport for her.
I should like Manyasha to send a box of “my ” pen-nibs with her.
Believe it or not, I have not been able to find them here.
Foolish people, these Czechs and Germans—no English nibs, only “ our own” make, which is awful rubbish.
What does Mitya write? When will the exams be over? What does Mark intend to do this summer? I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good health.

There was no Russian consul in Prague and my application for a passport for Nadya had to be wit-nessed.
Vienna is a huge, lively and beautiful city.
After the “province” where I live it is pleasant to see the metro-polis.
There is something to look at here, so it is worth while stopping off (should any of you be travelling this way).
For this purpose I have sent Nadya a pocket Führer durch Wien.
I hope she will soon be seeing you—there should be no hitch with the passport now.
I ask Manyasha, when she happens to be in the centre of the town, to buy Hend-schel’s Telegraph (two marks) for Nadya (it is not worth the trouble of sending one from here).
Among other things, I have seen the Museum der bilden-den Künste * here, and even saw a Viennese operetta.
I did not like it very much, I was also at a meeting where a Volksuniversitätskurse ** was in progress.

She wants to do some work in the libraries there.
I hope she will find it much more convenient in Berlin than here—the Prague * libraries are not up to much.
I am very sorry you have been unable to get a decent apartment, and that your summer place is not good either.
The summer does not look promising for those who spend it in the country if one may judge by the beginning and by the weather here—cloudy and rainy.
It is all right for us, of course, because we stay in town all summer, but it will be rotten for you.
Perhaps Mitya will be able to find you something better.
I also hope very much that Mark and Manyasha will soon manage to be with you.

1 1 Printed from the original128 TO HIS SISTER MARIA 216 May 19, 1901 I have decided to write you a few lines, dear Manyasha, or you will be thinking I have turned into a real pig.
I have been forgetting my obligations surprisingly often since I have been here.
It is true that now Nadya and Y.
V.
have arrived we are much more comfortable; we have our own apartment and I am beginning to work more regularly, but there is still more than enough bother.
How are you? I hope you have got yourself into a more correct regime for that is so important in solitary confinement.
I have just written a letter to Mark in which I described in exceptional detail how best to establish a “regime”; as regards mental work, I particularly recommended transla-tions, especially both ways—first do a written translation from the foreign language into Russian, then translate it back from Russian into the foreign language.
My own experience has taught me that this is the most rational way of learning a language.
On the physical side I have strongly recommended him, and I repeat it to you, to do gymnastics every day and rub himself down with a wet towel.
In solitary confinement this is absolutely essential.
I saw from one of your letters that Mother sent on to me that you have found some ways of employing your time.
I hope this will enable you to forget, even if only occasion-ally, your surroundings, and that the passage of time (which usually passes quickly in prison unless conditions are par-ticularly bad) will be even less noticeable.
I also advise you to arrange your work on the books you have in such a way as to vary it; I remember quite well that a changeof reading or work—from translation to reading, from writ-ing to gymnastics, from serious reading to fiction—helps a great deal.
Sometimes a change of mood for the worse— one’s mood changes so easily in prison—is due simply to fatigue from monotonous impressions or monotonous work, and a change of occupation is often enough to bring one back to normal and calm one’s nerves.
I remember that after dinner, for recreation in the evening, I read fiction regelmässig, * and never enjoyed it anywhere as much as I did in prison.
The main thing is never to forget the ob-ligatory daily gymnastics.
Force yourself to go through several dozen (no allowances!) movements of all kinds! This is very important.
Well, good-bye for now.
Many kisses; I wish you good health and vigour.
Yours, Vlad.

Printed from the original129 TO HIS MOTHER June 7, 1901 Mother dearest, I have received your letter of May 10 and newspapers from Mitya.
Many thanks for the letter and the papers.
I would ask Mitya in future to send any interesting issues of Russian newspapers that he can get hold of; there is no library here and I seldom see anything but Russkiye Vedo-mosti.

Anyuta is now in Berlin and has already written to me that she has received the royalties that were sent her, and that in general she receives your letters more quickly than before.
I am very glad that you like your summer place and can spend a lot of time in the open air.
From what Anyuta said I had imagined your new place to be much too flimsy and cold.
What is it like there when it rains? It is sad there is no change in the affairs of Mark and Manyasha.
Just before Anyuta left I wrote letters to them containing a lot of stuff about how to spend one’s time in prison.
I don’t know whether the letters got there and actually reached them.
We have fixed our apartment up very nicely here.
Rents are cheaper here than in such (relatively) big towns in Rus-sia; we furnished the place with second-hand things we bought cheap, and Yelizaveta Vasilyevna and Nadya man-age the housekeeping themselves without any particular trouble—housekeeping here is much easier.
The place is a good one, too—on the outskirts; there is water near usand a park with lots of greenery.
There are good connections with the centre, thanks to the electric trams.
A few days ago I received 250 rubles from my publisher and the financial side of things is now not bad.
In general, I am fixed up here comfortably in all respects and have only one wish—for our two to be released as soon as possible, so that you will not have to remain almost alone.
Y.
V.
and Nadya are well and send their best regards to you and all our people.
Nadya intends to write soon.
Many kisses for you, my dear, and I wish you very good health.

1 1 Printed from the original130 TO HIS MOTHER July 1, 1901 Mother dearest, It is quite a long time since I had news of you.
Are you well? I recently received from Anya a letter of Mark’s with a postscript to me that you had sent her.
I was very glad to hear from him (there has been no reply to my letter from Manyasha), but I was sorry to learn of the rather wretched arrangements in their cells.
Their imprisonment has come at a bad time—summer.
By the way, the summer here is not hot and there is a lot of rain.
What is your summer like? I have received the 75 rubles that Mitya sent, which probably came from the sale of my gun.
Merci for the money.
Did he receive Nadya’s letter in which she asked him to send me three copies of my book on capitalism? Have you any acquaintances in Podolsk? Do you see the gentleman we went boating with last year? 217 You probably go to Moscow once a week, or perhaps more than once, don’t you? Have any of the Siberian friends called on you when passing through? 218 I embrace you, Mother dearest, and wish you good health.
Very best regards from all to Mitya, Mark and Manyasha.

1 1 Printed from the original131 TO HIS MOTHER July 17, 1901 Mother dearest, A few days ago I received a letter from you which had been forwarded to me by Anyuta.
I was exceedingly glad to learn that there is a hope of our people being released shortly.
Perhaps the authorities will realise that there is no “case” to be made of it.
Even if they do make out a “case”, they should let them out soon, because now, in incomparably more important cases, people are released on remand “until the investigation has been completed”.
It is a good thing that Manyasha feels well and vigorous, as I see from the letter Anyuta sent on to me.
Anyuta wrote me a few days ago that she is thinking of going to stay in the country; it would not be a bad thing, although I must say that towns abroad are better adapted to the summer—the streets are watered more often, etc.
— and it is easier to spend the summer here in town than it is in Russia.
We, for instance, are able to swim every day in a very good swimming pool at a relatively low cost, there are places for walks and one does not have to go far to get out of town.
The traffic in the streets here is far less than in an equally large Russian city; this is because the electric trams and bicycles are completely ousting cabs.
The commercial traffic in the suburb where we live is ex-ceedingly small.
For this reason we are quite content with our present place of residence and do not intend to go to a village or summer resort.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Best regards to Mitya and especially to Mark and Manyasha.

1 1 Printed from the original132 TO HIS MOTHER August 3, 1901 Mother dearest, I have received your letter of June 13.
A big merci for it.
It is very strange that they won’t allow even Mitya a visit.
There is one consolation—the case is coming to an end and soon our people will be released and sent into exile.
Perhaps it can be arranged not too far from Moscow— I am talking about Manyasha, since Mark, as you say, has decided to go to his brother.
219 Since Mark’s case will prob-ably end without a conviction there perhaps remains a hope of his being able to complete the course 220 —if not in the normal period, at least with the loss of only a year; he may be able to get special permission, since he has graduated in mathematics.
When is Mitya going away, and for how long? When will he be through with his examinations? What does he think of doing? Is he still as keen to become a public health officer? Life here goes on as usual.
I had thought of taking a short trip with Nadya but the weather is too changeable.
We are again having rainy days now.
This summer has been just the kind to spend in town, rather than in the country.
I am expecting a letter soon from Anyuta with her new address.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well.
Best regards to Mitya, Mark and Manyasha.

1 1 Printed from the original133 TO HIS MOTHER September 1, 1901 Mother dearest, We recently received your letter to Nadya with a letter from Manyasha enclosed.
It was very sad to learn that our people’s affairs are in such a sorry state! I just don’t know what to advise, my dear.
Please don’t worry too much—the prosecutor’s office, is probably making so much trouble by way of a last attempt to work up a “case” out of nothing, and when these attempts fail they will have to grant a re-lease.
It might help to go to St.
Petersburg, if your health permits, and complain of something so unheard of as no interrogation for six months.
That constitutes such a defi-nite and obvious illegal act that it is the best thing to submit a complaint about it.
In any ease, Peters-burg would send an inquiry to Moscow and cause the lat-ter to abandon a little of its provincial high-handedness (that was what happened when Mitya was arrested).
That is the argument in favour of a trip to St.
Petersburg.
There is, of course, also an argument against it—the outcome is doubtful and it will cause you a great deal of an-xiety.
You are in the best position to decide whether it is worth while undertaking anything of the sort, and you have probably discussed it with acquaintances.
You should also complain of the refusal to allow Mitya to see Manyasha, 221 because that is something very much out of the ordinary.
As far as concerns Anyuta, I shall not, of course, write to her about what you have told me, so as not to upset her too much.
I hope I shall soon—perhaps in a few weeks—be seeing her and will try to reassure her a little.
When you have some spare time, my dear, please write and tell me how you are keeping, whether you are quite well and what you are thinking of doing in the autumn.
Are you moving to Moscow or will you remain in Podolsk for the time being? When is M.
V.
leaving? 222 When you see Manyasha and Mark again, give them best regards from all of its.
Now summer has passed—summer is the worst time to be in prison—and after the interrogation they will probably realise a little more clearly how trivial the whole affair is.
I embrace you again and again, my dear, and wish you good health and vigour.
You remember, when I was locked up, you imagined the case to be more serious and dangerous than it was, and, of course, Manyasha’s and Mark’s case bears no comparison with mine! They are probably being held a long time, partly because so many people have been arrested and the case has not yet been properly sorted out— anything so absurd would, of course, be impossible in St.
Petersburg.
I again kiss you, Yours, V.
Ul.
Life here goes on as usual; Yelizaveta Vasilyevna is rather poorly, there is influenza about again.

1 1 Printed from the original134 TO HIS MOTHER September 21, 1901 Mother dearest, I have received your letter of August 22.
Merci for it and also for the money (35 rubles), which we at last received after long delays that had been caused accidentally by a friend.
Our finances are not in too bad a state.
My publisher has sent me something and I hope to manage on that for quite a time, especially as the cost of living here is not high if you run your own house.
There is no need to send anything, merci.
We also received your letter to Nadya a short while ago and I replied to it.
* Did you get my reply? I have had the news from Anyuta that the investigation of the case involving our people is finished and the case has been handed over to the prosecutor.
That is a good thing; they will now probably be less worried and the time they will be kept locked up will be shorter.
Perhaps your request to have them released on bail will be granted.
Sure-ly they will not keep them in prison now that the investi-gation is over—that is hardly likely, As regards our acquaintances in St.
Petersburg things are pretty bad.
There does not seem to be anybody left there, with the possible exception of one old friend ** whom you know and whose wife visited you in Moscow when Yelizaveta Vasilyevna was at your place.

The weather here is a little better now, after a long period of rain, and we are making use of it for long walks in the beautiful country round about; since we did not manage to go away anywhere for the summer we have to take what chances we have! Yelizaveta Vasilyevna is now recovering and feels much better.
She sends you and everybody her best regards, so does Nadya.

Anyuta also wrote to me about Mark’s plan.
Well, Har-bin, I think, is not so very far away now and it will soon be nearer—when the line is opened.
Anyway, Mark will probably not have to stay there very long.

Printed from the original136 TO HIS MOTHER March 24, 1902 Mother dearest, It is quite a while since I last received any news of you.
How are you? We have recently been having perfect spring weather—people go out in summer coats or even without them.
There has been no winter at all this year, I should say, though I expect winter is still with you even now in Russia.
In Samara, I suppose, the snow is now melting and the time of impassable mud or puddles hidden under the snow is beginning.
223 What have you in mind for the summer? It would be a good thing if you could get away from town, at least as far as the Zhiguli Hills if you cannot go any further (as I hope you will be able to).
How are you keeping now, my dear? In spring, I suppose, all sorts of colds and other ill-nesses are going around your way too.
What does the future hold in store for Mark? Anyuta writes that instead of Manchuria he is now counting on getting a job somewhere on the Volga.
Did he get the job, and where does he intend to live? I have not had any letters from Mitya either and do not know whether he is in Moscow, or in the south, or how matters stand with his job.
What about Manyasha? Is she still working for the Zem-stvo council? She, too, will have to get away from Samara in summer—I still cannot forget how foul it is in the heat.
We are also thinking of where to go in summer, although the towns here in summer are quite different from those of Russia.
I sometimes see Russian magazines—far from all of them and not regularly either.
How do you people like Veresayev’snew story in Mir Bozhy? At first I expected a lot, but I am not very pleased with the continuation.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send best regards to Manyasha and all acquaintances.

I even started sending Anyuta letters asking about you.
As regards books—please tell Manyasha not to send them until I let you have a new address.
224 I am grateful to her for sorting out the books; the only German books I should like to receive are those that are not needed (and not even likely to be needed) in Russia by you or by acquaintances.
That is because I can easily get German books here, there is no shortage of them.
But there is a shortage of Russian books, so please, could all possible Russian books be picked out and even all the statistics and put in a separate box, for I am beginning to miss these things and am thinking of having them all sent.
I am particularly grateful to Manyasha for putting in some Rus-sian classics.
How are you keeping now, my dear? Are you still think-ing of a trip abroad in summer? It would be excellent, if it would not tire you too much.

139 TO HIS MOTHER May 8, 1902 Mother dearest, A few days ago I received a postcard with a view of the Volga and with congratulations from Manyasha.
Many thanks for it.
I do not know whether you have been receiving my letters regularly lately.
I have had nothing from you except that postcard for quite a while.
Do you correspond with Y.
V.
who is now in St.
Petersburg and does not seem to like it very much and is thinking of coming back? I am hoping to see you soon, my dear.
225 I hope the journey will not tire you too greatly.
You absolutely must choose day trains and spend the nights in hotels.
Hotels abroad are not expensive and you can spend a comfortable night in one.
It is quite impossible to travel for several days without a rest because of the speed of the trains here and of the short stops.
I am anxiously awaiting news of your departure.
Perhaps you will send a telegram from Russia, or from somewhere abroad, when you board the train that will actually bring you here.
That would be much more convenient.
I wanted to ask you to bring some of the clothes I left behind, but now I think it is not worth while; the things I left behind must have come in handy for Mitya and it is not worth the trouble of buying new things in Russia and bringing them here.
If there is anything left that is of no use to anyone else, you could bring it (not much, of course, so as not to overburden you).
I advise you to take express trains in Germany and Aus-tria (the extra fare in the third class is small but the time gained is tremendous), and buy Hendschel’s Telegraph and draw up a timetable before you leave home.
Manyasha, for instance, is probably familiar with that directory.
I embrace you fondly, my dear; best regards to all.

With regard to an address for the despatch of books, I will try and send it soon.
It is a great pity that you still have to be bothered with this burden! Well, we shall put an end to all that soon and you will be rid of all the books.
We are all expecting you, my dear, and I am correspond-ing with Anyuta regarding her plans—how and where to make arrangements for you to stay.
The weather seems to be continuing fine, here and where Anyuta lives.
* Yeli-zaveta Vasilyevna writes that she will probably be leaving soon; she does not seem to be very well pleased with her trip (I, incidentally, tried all the time to talk her out of it, showing her that there was no need for her to go and that she would soon be missing us).
I do not write about my health because I am quite well.

I doubt whether Manyasha is still living at the old address but I am writing there since I have no other and expect that the letter will he forwarded to her.
Where is Anyuta? What news have you had from Mitya and Mark? What are you thinking of doing for the winter? Are you well, my dear? Was the journey not too tiring? Life goes on as usual; the only thing is that we have re-cently been a little busier.
I have now got into a more regular way of life, but try to spend more time in the library.
The weather is extraordinarily fine—our reward for a dreadful summer.
Nadya and I have travelled and walked round a great deal of the surrounding country and have found some very nice places.
If you are having the same kind of weather you should take advantage of it somewhere in the country, because I expect there is little pleasure to be had from living in Samara itself, even at this time of the year.

1 1 Printed from the original143 TO HIS MOTHER November 9, 1902 Mother dearest, I received your letter quite a long time ago but have somehow been unable to get down to answering it; and anyway I have been expecting an answer to my previous letter.
Mitya’s release 228 —in my last letter I wrote that I was sure of it—actually took place much quicker than I expected.
I am particularly glad for Anyuta’s sake, be-cause she has not had to spend a long time hanging about various government offices (often an extremely unpleasant business, even more unpleasant than being in prison!) and has at last been able to go to Mark.
She had been wandering from place to place without a home of her own, so to speak, for much too long.
What news is there now from her? Is Mark satisfied with his job? Does Mitya earn anything, and is he thinking of visiting you? I hope you are keeping well, my dear.
As for us, we are going on as usual and do nothing excit-ing.
The weather is warm, similar to our August weather; even in a summer coat it is hot (of course people are von unten warm angezogen, * in the jerseys they wear abroad).

There was also a short letter from Anyuta; she seems to be well content with her new place.
Manyasha writes that you will soon be seeing Mitya and his wife.
* Give him very best regards from me and all of us.
Perhaps Anyuta will visit you, too, and you will all he together for a short while during the holidays.
That would be fine.
Our life here goes on just the same as usual.
It was cold for a few weeks (cold here means “not thawing”) but there was no snow and we all caught colds.
But we are all right now.
The weather is again wet—at this rate I shall soon get unused to our winter! I see from Manyasha’s letter that she liked Zheleznov’s book.
I have not read it, of course; I merely turned over the pages, and so cannot undertake to judge.
When I have read it, I will write about it.
What I wrote concerned only the first, superficial impression.
Manyasha also writes that she has taken up languages, even English.
I thought of sending her a textbook on pro-nunciation, a very good one, in German.
I have been doing some study lately and am very pleased with the book; * Lenin’s brother and his wife visited Samara in the winter of 1902.
—Ed.
I can’t praise it enough.
The book is, Henry Sweet, Ele-mentarbuch des gesprochenen Englisch, Oxford, 1901, and it costs something like a ruble twenty-live kopeks.
If Manya-sha would like me to, I can send it; I do not need it any more.
Since she has Toussaint, however, I don’t know whether it is worth while, because Toussaint is excellent.
I used not to believe in this system but now I am sure it is the only serious, efficient system.
If you take a few les-sons from a native foreigner after working through the first part of Toussaint you can certainly acquire a thorough knowl-edge of the language.
There are Toussaint dictionaries now as well, in which the pronunciation is indicated; I strongly advise Manyasha to buy them because our Alexandrov is wrong in many cases.
(For instance, I strongly advise her to buy Muret’s pocket dictionary that uses the Toussaint meth-od, Taschenwörterbuch der englischen und deutschen Spra-che, Teil I, Englisch-deutsch, Preis 2 Mark.

1 1 Printed from the original145 TO HIS MOTHER December 26, 1902 Mother dearest, Please send the enclosed letter to Anyuta; I have not got her address, I must have lost it (I have not yet written her a single letter) and perhaps she is not in Tomsk now, but with you.
I believe you were hoping you would all be together for the holidays, Mitya as well.
Write and tell me whether it turned out that way, and whether you made the acquaintance of Mitya’s wife.
We still have absolutely nothing new to tell you.
The cold is over and we now have what we would call autumn weather; by way of exception it is dry, and this is very pleasant.
The holidays here will probably be rather boring— few meetings, the reading-rooms closed and the theatres all overcrowded and difficult to get into.
However, I am hoping to see some new acquaintances during this period.
I have recently been reading the German newspapers more than usual; there have been some interesting happen-ings in Germany and sometimes I wanted to get the story straight from the source.
Things seem to be quieting down there, too.
230 How are you getting on? Are the worst frosts over? Have you any new acquaintances? Hoping you will have a good time this holiday and will all keep well.
Yours, V.

1 1 Printed from the originalQP 146 TO HIS MOTHER February 4, 1903 Mother dearest, It is a very long time since I received as much as a single letter from you or any of our people.
One of your letters must have gone astray, because I cannot believe that no-body has written to me all this time.
I don’t know whether Mitya came to visit you, whether he stayed for long, what his plans are, and where he is now.
Have you had any news of Anyuta, did she move to Port Arthur 231 and when? Are you well? Is the weather in Russia really still as cold as ever? The weather here is fine.
It has been an exceptionally good mild winter, with very little rain or fog (so far).
Y.
V.
, it is true, still gets ill rather often; she is ill now but not very badly, so we are making do with home treat-ment and Russian remedies.
It would probably be good for her to move somewhere further south.
Nadya and I are both well and are jogging along as usual.
We recently went to our first concert this winter and were very pleased with it—especially with Chaikovsky’s latest symphony (Symphonic pathétique).
Are there any good concerts in Samara? We went once to a German theatre but what we should like would be to visit the Russian Art Theatre and see The Lower Depths.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you everything of the best, especially health.
Regards to all; perhaps you will forward the letter to Anyuta.
Otherwise, when shall I learn her address? Yours, V.

1 1 Printed from the original147 TO HIS MOTHER February 22, 1903 Mother dearest, I have received your letter, for which a big merci.
It was very interesting to hear about Anyuta.
By the way, please send her this letter as I do not know her address.
It is true she recently sent me a brief note for which I am very grateful, but she forgot to say anything about her address and, in general, she was so hazy about everything that I am completely bewildered.
I learned about the “Chi-nese” philistines * only from you.
In a way, that is closer to Europe, or to the New World! Rather interesting, I think, very much so, in fact! I am very, very sorry about the old friend.
** Would it not be quicker to correspond with the Chinese lady through Japan or through some British port? True enough, it is farther by sea, but the Europeans are many times more punctual! Life here goes on as usual.
Nothing particularly good has happened and nothing bad either, and in general I feel much less ueberarbeitet *** than before.
I expect to take a trip to Germany in a few days.
232 The weather is asto-nishingly fine, it is hot in a light coat; sunshine and a warm, warm breeze.

1 1 Printed from the original148 TO HIS MOTHER March 29, 1903 Mother dearest, I received your letter a few days ago—a big merci for it.
So Anyuta has been delayed in the Far East longer than she expected.
I thought she would be with you by now.
Still, I suppose a long journey like that requires some prepara-tion.
Mitya, too, it seems, has not yet decided on where he is going to live.
Is poor Manyasha very lonesome? I am glad it is warmer now in Samara, because very cold winters are extremely tiring.
Are you now feeling bet-ter, my dear? It is warm here.
We recently took Y.
V.
on a long outing too —we took sandwiches with us instead of lunch and spent the whole of one Sunday ins Grüne (quite unintentionally we are taking to foreign ways and arrange our outings on Sundays of all days, though that is the worst time be-cause everywhere is crowded).
We had a long walk, the air went to our heads as if we were children and afterwards I had to lie down and rest, as I did after a shooting trip in Siberia.
In general, we do not miss a chance to go on outings.
We are the only people among the comrades here who are exploring every bit of the surrounding country.
We discover various “rural” paths, we know all the places nearby and intend to go further afield.
I have been feeling very well lately, I work regularly and do not worry about the commotion around me.
Nadya and Y.
V.
are also well.
I embrace you fondly, my dear.
Please write from time to time (or ask Manyasha to) about yourselves and your plans.

Let them remain with you, for the time being at any rate.
I would, however, ask you to buy a few books with some of the money.
I have already writ-ten about a Russian-French Dictionary.
To this I should like to add Sechenov’s Elementy mysli (a recently pub-lished book).
A few days ago I had a wonderful outing to Salève with Nadya and a friend.
* Down below in Geneva it was all mist and gloom, but up on the mountain (about 4,000 feet above sea level) there was glorious sunshine, snow, tobogganing— altogether a good Russian winter’s day.
And at the foot of the mountain—la mer du brouillard, a veritable sea of mist and clouds, concealing everything except the moun-tains jutting up through it, and only the highest at that.
Even little Salève (nearly 3,000 feet) was wrapped in mist.
So we are beginning to get to know Switzerland and its scenery.
In the spring we intend to make a long walking tour.

KRUPSKAYA 1903151 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S MOTHER July 2 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, We received Manyasha’s letter the day before yesterday and yours yesterday.
How glad I was! If only they will soon release Anya! I embrace you fondly, my dears.
It is such a pity that you are both suffering from ill health.
You absolutely must take a rest—the main thing is to get your lungs filled with fresh air; after all, Kiev is a city.
The only thing is that in the north the summer is bad; Mother is living near St.
Petersburg at the country house of some friends and complains of the terrible cold and the rain.
I believe that there is everything conducive to rest at M.
T.
’s country place.
We are now on holiday, too.
We have let our house and I am very glad we have, because keeping it clean and housekeeping in general took the whole day, there was sometimes such a hubbub at our place; the need to think about housekeeping all the time was a nuisance.
If you go out for a walk, you are left without milk, if you are not up by seven o’clock you have the pleasure of going to town for meat, and so on.
And in winter it was so cold.
We shall now find something more convenient.
In general I am dreaming of autumn, when I shall be able to sit down and work seriously.
I am thinking of various ways of avoid-ing the constant turmoil; it is terribly tiring.
We are now in Lausanne.
It is already a week since we got away from Geneva and are now resting in the full sense of the word.
We have left our work and our worries in Geneva and herewe sleep 10 hours a day, and go swimming and walking— Volodya does not even read the newspapers properly; we took a minimum of books with us, and even those we are send-ing back to Geneva tomorrow, unread, while we ourselves shall don our rucksacks at four in the morning and set out for a two weeks’ walking tour in the mountains.
234 We shall go to Interlaken and from there to Lucerne.
We are reading Baedeker and planning our journey carefully.
In a week we have “recovered” quite considerably and have even begun to look healthy again.
It has been a difficult winter and our nerves have been under such a strain that we cannot be blamed for taking a month’s holiday, although I am already feeling guilty about it.
The weather is a bit doubtful, there is no rain, but the air is rather misty.
For the time being that is all I have to write about us.
Volodya and I have made an agreement not to talk about our work—work, he says, is not a bear and will not escape to the woods—not even to mention it, and, as far as possible, not to think about it.
I shall be writing to Manyasha, probably this evening, and in the meantime I embrace all of you fondly, my dears, and send you many kisses.
Yours, Nadya Mother dearest, I will add just a few words.
Very best regards to Manyasha and congratulations on her release.
This summer you absolutely must rest.
Please go and stay in the country somewhere.
We are taking walks and having a good holiday.
I embrace you.

Thank her for the trouble she has taken over the translations.
Nadya will write about this in detail.
I have now received Hobson’s book on imperialism and have begun translating it 235 —only a little at a time because I am still enjoying the summer way of life—walking, swimming and lazing around.
Altogether, I have had an excellent rest this summer! What about you? Is the cottage at Sablino a good one? Are you having a good rest? What is the outlook for the future? Are you keeping well? How are Anyuta and Manya-sha after their imprisonment? Drop me a line about this because Manyasha only speaks about translations.

Anyuta has probably told you of our plans for a holiday.
I came back terribly tired.
I have now completely recovered.
Here you can have a wonderful rest, swimming, walking, no people and no work.
236 No people and no work—that is the best thing for me.
I expect to be here another fortnight or so and then to return to work.
Nadya and her mother are well and are having a good holiday.
How are you all fixed up there? Are you well? Have you seen Anyuta? Where is she? With you now, or with Mark? When you can, drop me a line or ask Mitya to.
I embrace you fondly, Yours, V.

Regards from me to Mitya and his wife.
Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Volodya does not usually send regards and so I send regards to you from Mother and myself.
We also send regards to all our people.
I can confirm the fact that we are having a good rest; we have all put on so much weight it’s not decent to show ourselves in public.
.

Here there is a pine forest, sea, magnificent weather, in short, everything is excellent.
It is also a good thing that there is no housekeep-ing to do.
And what sort of a rest are you having? Howis your malaria? Have you got rid of it completely? Do you go mushrooming? How are you, in general, and what are you doing? Here we are cut off from the whole world; although there is a post six times a week nobody writes anything.
Once again I embrace you fondly.

1 1 Printed from the original156 LENIN AND KRUPSKAYA TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA Dear Manyasha, Thanks for the letter.
I must apologise for not answering at once.
I have got so “embedded ” in summer holidays and in loafing (I am having a rest such as I have not had for several years) that I am still postponing all business matters, great and small.
I am against boycotting the Third Duma; I have been writing a little piece on this subject which will probably soon be out.
237 In my opinion that slogan must not be revived unless there is a situation of heightened political activity, unless there is a struggle against early consti-tutional illusions.
Any fresh burst of enthusiasm (there may be one on account of the July strike of Moscow tex-tile workers—up to 400,000 are expected to strike) must be expanded, preparations must be made, it must be made general, but it would be out of place to declare a boycott.
We must not renounce the slogan altogether; if the situation arises we shall, in a moment of political upsurge, propose a boycott.
To declare a boycott at the moment would be either premature bravado or the uncritical repetition of slogans that have a glorious revolutionary past.
Such, in a few words, is my argument; it is developed in detail in the press.
* * It should be out in about a fortnight.
Write and tell me how you are fixed up and whether you are satisfied.
Best regards to Mark and all acquaintances.
We are having a wonderful rest and are loafing.
Many kisses, Yours, V.
U.
Darling Manyasha, I am adding a few words.
There is nothing to write about since we are, at the moment, “outside public interests” and are leading a holiday life—bathing in the sea, cycling (the roads are bad, by the way, so you can’t go far).
Volodya plays chess, fetches water, at one time we had a craze for the English game of “Donkey”, and so on.
The only thing is that Lidya has a lot of bother with the housekeeping.
.
.
.
Everybody here is putting on weight splen-didly.
We could read a lot but none of the books here are very suitable and anyway we don’t feel like reading.
Many kisses, Yours, N.
Our people (Lidya and Mother) send regards, of course.

I believe the last letter was the one I sent from my summer Mon Repos.
We have now settled down to family life for the winter in the old place.
238 We hope the winter will not be as cold as the last.
But we shall arrange things better now and “bat-ten down the hatches”.
I am very pleased with the premises and with the way things have been fixed up.
Manyasha has been staying with us and is still here, but she intends leaving today because winter is setting in; the first snow fell today and it has turned cold.
How are you getting along there? Will it be all right in the country when the real cold sets in? Please convey my best regards to Mitya.
It was a pity I could not visit him in the autumn, 239 we could have had some magnificent shooting, the weather was splendid all the time.
When is he getting his holiday, for how long, and where is he going? I have had a couple of letters from Anyuta.
She seems to be pleased with her trip.

Printed from the original159 LENIN AND KRUPSKAYA TO LENIN’S MOTHER January 22, 1908 Mother dearest, Today I received a letter from you and Manya and hasten to reply.
I was very glad to receive news from you direct—I have not received any of Manyasha’s earlier let-ters.
We had to resort to forwarding letters until we arrived in Geneva and it was a nuisance.
We were greatly worried at the news of Anyuta’s bad attack of influenza.
Your apartment must be a bad one (Nadya says it is damp), if there are such complications.
Are you all well now? How is Mitya? Has he gone away again in connection with his work? We are now settling down here and our arrangements, of course, will not be worse than before.
The only unpleas-ant thing was the actual moving, which was a change for the worse.
That, however, was inevitable.
About Capri— as soon as I arrived I found a letter from Gorky, who very insistently invites me there.
Nadya and I have made up our minds to accept that invitation and take a trip to Italy (in Capri now the narcissi are in bloom, so the Gorkys write), but not yet.
All our affairs must be settled first and then we can travel.
I wrote to Manyasha yesterday or the day before with further requests for books.
Am I giving her too many orders? I embrace you, my dear, and hope you are quite well.
Regards to all from Nadya and myself.
Yours, V.

16, Peterburgskaya Storona, St.
Petersburg, Russia February 7, 1908 Dear Manyasha, I have received your letter of January 20, a letter from the young writer on the same subject, and today I received Rech.
244 I am very, very grateful for the newspaper, the article is really extremely interesting! With regard to Webb—I have written to the young writer and have sent him something in the nature of power of attorney.
In any case I repeat (1) I do not know how many copies of the first edition there were; (2) Struve was the manager of the editorial office at that time and he edited the first volume; (3) the second volume was translated by Y.
Smirnov (Gurevich).
I then received 20 rubles for a print-er’s signature for the translation of the first volume and 10 rubles a signature for editing the second.
Let the young writer haggle—if need be, let, him go down to a half of that, provided the contract is concluded for a definite number of copies.
Yesterday I also received a letter from a colleague about Granat.
Things are working out quite well for me there.
As regards our marriage lines and the palm oil wanted in Krasnoyarsk, I propose that you should not take too much trouble or give any large quantity of palm oil.
It looks as if we shall manage without it.
In a month, if not sooner, we intend to set up our own apartment here.
With regard to the symposium in memory of Marx, it does not seem likely that I shall take part in it, either; such things cannot be written in a hurry.
245 Our people are taking a surprisingly long time to get well! It’s too bad.
The influenza this year must be partic-ularly malignant, or else you are having very bad weather.
Write and tell me how Mother is.
I have not yet fully settled down here—for instance, I have not yet joined my “club”, where it is convenient to read periodicals and easy to obtain new books.
246 I shall try (as soon as I have joined—probably in a day or two) to find whatever I can for you to translate.
Do you receive Neue Zeit= In the science supplement to No.
1 there is an article by Kautsky “Nationalität und Internationa-lität”.
I have not yet seen it.
Is it not suitable for transla-tion? I have read Kautsky’s Sozialismus und Kolonialpoli-tik (a new pamphlet of 80 pages).
I think it would be per-mitted.
Talk to Zerno * 247 about it; it would be a good thing to translate it.
I am also surprised that no announcement is to be seen of a translation of Parvus’s Kolonialpolitik und Zusammenbruch.
Has no one any initiative? Ask Zerno.
I could get in touch with the author here, abroad.
All the best, kiss Mother for me.

161 TO HIS SISTER MARIA February 14, 1908 Dear Manyasha, I recently wrote to you about some translations.
I should now like to add that I have read Ergänzungsheft No.
1 to Neue Zeit—an article by Kautsky “Nationalität und Inter-nationalität”.
I remember you said you receive Neue Zeit, so I shall not send it from here (give me an address to which I can send foreign books and articles, in case I need it).
In my opinion this is a thing that can be published legally and is really worth translating.
Propose it to the publisher (36 pages).
The best thing of all would be to publish it (it is a criticism of Bauer) with the book by Otto Bauer, Die Nationalitätenfrage und die Sozialdemokratie (Anya prob-ably has this book since she translated one chapter of it).
One of my colleagues here wants someone to ask the publisher whether he would undertake to publish Huschke’s Landwirtschaftliche Reinertragsberechnungen, which I quot-ed in Part I of my Agrarian Question.
248 If an opportunity occurs, ask the publisher and I will promise to write a preface.
But if the truth be told, it is too highly specialised a book.
.
.
.
I had a talk with the Director of the Police Department yesterday about my Acte de mariage.
It seems that it is necessary.
Ask some lawyer of your acquaintance to think of some other way of getting a copy from Krasnoyarsk (because probably no great hopes are to be placed in “palm oil”).
There does exist some (legal) procedure which makesit possible to obtain proof of marriage.
Cannot Yelizaveta Vasilyevna apply to a justice of the peace or to the relevant authority in St.
Petersburg and demand from him an instruction to issue a certificate to her requiring the Krasno-yarsk church authorities to supply her with a copy of the marriage lines (either for legal action against her daughter, or in connection with the disposal of an inheritance, etc.
).
Is it not possible by some such means to obtain the certifi-cate or a copy of it? Ask a lawyer.
How is everybody? Have Mother and Anyuta fully recovered? Yours, V.

Printed from the original163 TO HIS SISTER ANNA March 10, 1908 Dear Anyuta, I have received your letter of February 21.
It really is terrible that you should have got hold of a damp apartment and are all so ill.
And what a misfortune for Manyasha to get typhus! Lidiya Mikhailovna writes every day and says that her temperature is not very high.
I am afraid, however, of taking comfort from this news—there are grave forms of typhus that are not accompanied by high temperatures.
How is Mother keeping now? If you have no time to write, ask L.
Mikh.
, since she is the one who writes, to add a couple of lines.
Mark was actually wrong to leave such a large sum out of his resettlement allowance, because my publisher now pays me enough.
251 It goes without saying that you absolutely must spend that money to make things easier for Manyasha and Mother or to help them get away to a better place.
Could they not come here? I have sent Manyasha a book to translate (a German novel).
Did she get it (from Leipzig 252 )? I also wrote to her about a book by Anatole France (La vie de Jeanne d’Arc) and one by Sinclair (Alexinsky suggests they be transla-ted).
All the best and please give Mother many kisses.
Nadya has gone away on business but asks me to send you her regards.

I think the last time was a postcard from London.
254 I arrived back from there with a bout of abdominal catarrh.
I am better now and have begun to eat properly, and after the diet feel hungry all the time.
I have begun work again.
Life here goes on as usual.
The weather is extremely change-able—one day it is hot, oppressive and stormy and then, like today, it is rainy and cold.

I stand very much in need of it at this very moment.

1 1 Printed from the original166 TO HIS SISTER MARIA July 13, 1908 Dear Manyasha, I have just received your letter with Anyuta’s postscript.
I was very glad to get the news.
I was extremely glad to learn that there is a possibility of its publication in autumn.
* Your St.
Petersburg correspondent, however, has forgotten to answer one of my questions, an important one—is it not possible to obtain even one copy of the book in printed form, whether it has been made up or not? If the book is to come out in the autumn this is not impossible.
I am prepared to pay five or even ten rubles to get a copy now.
The point is that it is absolutely essential for me to show this book, before autumn, to certain people who cannot read the manuscript.
If I cannot show the book to these people before autumn, I stand to lose a lot in all respects.
And so, since you have the St.
Petersburg address, and the owner of that address answers you and is closely in touch with the whole business—I ask you very earnestly to write to him and enquire, if there is the slightest opportunity, to get me just one copy, even if it means giving the right person “palm oil” to the extent of five rubles.
My illness has held up my work on philosophy very badly.
I am now almost well again and will most certainly write the book.

167 TO HIS SISTER MARIA August 9, 1908 Dear Manyasha, I am sending you a picture of the place I have just returned from.
I went to the mountains for a holiday.
The weather prevented my staying there longer.
Nevertheless I had an excellent holiday.
I hope that in about six weeks my too-long-delayed work will at last be finished.
Then we shall be able to go walking together.
I am hoping very much that you will pay us a long visit in autumn.
You will, won’t you? Of course, you will! It would be wonderful if Mother could come, too.
The weather this summer has not been good, more rain and thunderstorms than usual.
There is a hope that September will turn out fine here.
Do come! Maria Ivanovna was here on her way from Paris.
We had a bit of a chat.
I visited her last Sunday evening.
She spent a couple of days in Geneva and then went on to Italy.
She was not long in Paris—a fortnight altogether.
In general she is doing her tour abroad in too much of a rush! Give Mother many, many kisses for me.

Today I read an amusing newspaper article on the inhabitants of Mars in connection with a new English book by Lowell, Mars and Its Canals.
Lowell is an astronomer who has worked for a long time in a special observatory which, I believe, is the best in the world (in America).
It is a scientific work.
It argues that Mars is inhabitable, that the canals are a miracle of engineering, that people on that planet must be two and two-thirds the size of our people here, and that they, furthermore, have trunks and are covered with feathers or animal skins and have four or six legs.

169 TO HIS MOTHER September 30, 1908 Mother dearest, I have not written to you for a long time; I hoped that Manyasha would come and tell me about you but her jour-ney is constantly being postponed.
It would be a good thing if she could come in the second half of October (New Style) and we could take a trip to Italy together.
I am think-ing of taking a week’s holiday when I have finished my work (it is now drawing to a close).
* On October 11 I shall be in Brussels for three days and shall return here after-wards and might think of a trip to Italy.
258 Why should not Mitya come here, too? He ought to take a rest after all his work with the sick.
Of course, you must invite him, too—we could go for some splendid walks together.
If there are money difficulties, you must take the money Anya has in the bank.
I hope I shall now earn a lot.
It would be fine if we could take a trip to the Italian lakes.
They say it is excellent there in the late autumn.
Anyuta will probably come and stay with you soon, so you can send Manyasha and Mitya.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good health.

1 1 Printed from the original170 TO HIS SISTER ANNA October 27, 1908 Dear Anyuta, I am surprised at your long silence.
I suppose the move to Moscow caused a lot of bother and you have had no time for letters.
Please give me an address to which I can send the manuscript of my book.
* It is ready.
It amounts to 24 printer’s signatures (at the rate of 40,000 letters a signature) and that is about 400 pages.
In a fortnight I shall have finished reading it over and will send it off; I should like to have a good address to send it to.
Things seem to be bad as far as a publisher is concerned; I was informed today that Granat has bought the Menshe-viks’ “history”—in other words the Mensheviks have come out on top in that field.
It is obvious that he will now refuse to publish my book.
259 Bear in mind that I am not now chasing after royalties, i.
e.
, I am prepared to make con-cessions (any you like) and agree to the postponement of payment until the book shows a profit—in short there will be no risk for the publisher.
As regards the censor, I will also agree to all concessions because in general everything in the book is undoubtedly legal, with the possible exception of some expressions that may be unsuitable.

The first page of Lenin’s letter to his sister Anna, October 27, 1908171 TO HIS SISTER ANNA November 8, 1908 Dear Anyuta, Today I received postcards from you and Mother with the new address.
Did you get my letter addressed to Pros-nya, 44,4? I am afraid to send a big manuscript to your private address or any other except that of some publisher.
If you can find me such an address, I will send the manu-script immediately.
In the meantime I shall await an answer to this letter.
Incidentally, if the censor turns out to be very strict the word “popovshchina” can everywhere be changed to “fideism” with a footnote to explain it (Fideism.
is a doctrine which substitutes faith for knowledge, or which generally attaches significance to faith).
260 This is for emergencies—it is to explain the nature of the conces-sions I am making.

1 Printed from the original172 TO HIS MOTHER November 17, 1908 Mother dearest, Manyasha has left today for Lausanne to consult Dr.
Mermod, a distinguished specialist on ear troubles.
He made the appointment in writing—you have to wait your turn to see famous people here.
The general opinion, however, is that he is a competent doctor.
Four years ago I had a minor operation in his clinic and it was done magnificent-ly.
So I hope he will be able to help Manya, because her ear is troubling her quite a lot and prevents her from working.
She has taken a room on the same staircase as ours but a floor higher; a stove has been put in the room and it is warm there.
She has dinner and supper with us.
Her only trouble has been with her Latin.
It seems that Latin is obligatory and the only date for an examination was November 19.
This left her only ten days.
I did try to persuade her to risk it, covering all the grammar in a “forced march”, especially as she knows French very well.
She proved unable to work intensively, however, on account of her ear; the time was, so short that she stood a poor chance anyway.
And so she dropped the Latin.
She consoles herself with the idea that we shall probably all be going to Paris and she, of course, with us.
In Paris, Latin is not obligatory.
As regards this move of ours—it is almost fully decided, but I do not expect we shall be able to make a move in less than a month from now.
There will be more than enough bother with the moving, of course.
We hope that a big city will put some life into us all; we are tired ofstaying in this provincial backwater.
It is true, of course, that Paris is more expensive.
But the climate is no worse than that of Geneva.
Here the climate is rather damp and the mists are unpleasant.
We are going to find out what to do with the bicycles.
It is a pity to leave them behind; they are excellent things for holidays and pleasure trips, but the duty on them there is, I believe, quite high, although I hope to be able to manage that, too.
Please tell Anyuta that I have already sent my philosophical manuscript to the acquaintance who lived in the town where we met before my departure for Krasnoyarsk in 1900.
261 I hope that by now he has received it and delivered it to you.
If he has not, you must go and see him since he does not live far from you.
I ask you very earnestly to drop me a line immediately on receipt of the manuscript.
I have written to two friends in St.
Petersburg asking them to help me arrange publication.
* I asked them to write to Anyuta, if anything turns up, through our mutual acquaintance who works at Znaniye.
** I hope for very little from Znaniye itself; the “boss” there, *** who gave Anyuta a half promise, is an old fox and will probably go back on it after sniffing at the atmosphere on Capri, where Gorky lives.
We shall have to look elsewhere.
I have already written that I am prepared to make every concession.

173 TO HIS SISTER ANNA November 26, 1908 Dear Anyuta, I had just sent off a “distress” letter to you, when yours of November 9 arrived to tell me you had received the work intact.
I agree that I have been rather nervous both about sending it off and while I have been waiting.
I am simply scared to death of losing a huge piece of work that took many months and the delay really does put my nerves on edge.
You did very well to ask for an answer by telegraph.
If it is refused—it must be published immediately through Bonch.
It seems you will not be able to get another publish-er.
Bonch publishes on credit, through someone else, somehow, and it is not very likely that I shall receive anything, but, anyway, publish it he will.
262 I have already written to two colleagues in St.
Petersburg and will write again.
Of course, if anything turns up for you, hand it over, and, in general take charge of it yourself, although by all accounts there is very little chance.
If there is no publisher, send it direct to Bonch immedi-ately; the only thing is he must not give it to anybody to read and must look after it very carefully! Write to him about it.
I am sending two corrections, or rather one correction and one addition.
On page 60 (at the end of the “Introduc-tion”), following the words “Valentinov confuses them” (lines 9-10), cross out everything as far as “we” (the last line but one) and substitute this: “Valentinov confuses them, and while doing so veryamusingly tries to console us: ‘We would not consider the “kinship” of Mach to .
.
.
a philosophical crime’”* (etc.
, p.
61).
Please put that into the text.
The addition I am sending on a separate sheet which can easily be pasted in.
This is a footnote to the last word of Section 5 (Chapter Five).
263 I have no copy of this chapter at home and so I cannot tell you the last word, but it doesn’t matter.

Printed from the original174 TO HIS MOTHER December 10, 1908 Mother dearest, Today we have at last settled up for the flat.
Some of our things we are sending immediately by slow train.
We are leaving on Saturday or on Monday at the latest.
An apart-ment has been found for us—Avenue d’Orléans, 69 or 67, I will give you the exact address when I write from Paris.
264 You will now have to write to us through Manyasha.
The apartment that has been taken is on the ground floor, three rooms, one for Manyasha.
I have just received a letter from Anyuta and have sent her a telegram: acceptez immédiatement seconde condition.
* I am very glad that you have managed things without Znaniye and I think you must hurry up and sign a contract on the second condition.
The important thing now is not to lose time, to make sure that we have a publisher bound by a formal contract and then speed up publication.
If it is pos-sible the contract should contain a point on immediate publication.
(If you can, haggle for a larger number of free copies for the author, but do not make an issue of it.
) By the way—I advise Anya when she signs the contract to be careful, and not to give her own name if she can avoid it, so as not to be responsible under the press laws (and not go to prison in the event of trouble; she should get advice on this from people who know about such things).
Can a contract not be drawn up in my name, so as to leave Anyuta out of it altogether, i.
e.
, not even mention her? 265 * Accept the second condition immediately (Fr.
).
—Ed.
I have sent you two letters to the wrong address.
They have probably not been delivered to you since you do not say a word about them.
Perhaps it would be advisable to apply to the post office, attach the envelope from this letter to your application and point out that the writ-ing is the same, that the letters are from the same city and addressed to M.
A.
Ulyanova or A.
I.
Yelizarova, and that the only mistake is in the name of the street.
I wrote Khamov-niki, Sokolnichy Street instead of Obolensky Street.
Have you received those letters? If you have not, I will repeat the addition I sent in one of them.
* I am sending a few more minor changes to Chapter Five.
Please send me the proofs as they come off the press (all to be addressed to Mlle M.
Oulianoff, Boulevard St.
-Marcel 27, Paris), so that I can take a look at them.
If the worst comes to the worst I would, entre nous, agree to the first condition, but the second is so advantageous and the opportunity of publishing it immediately, and in Moscow at that, is so attractive that we must seize that opportunity with both hands.
As far as the author’s name is concerned, I do not insist—I don’t care what name it is, let the publi-sher choose one himself.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best regards to Anyuta.
So do we all.

Printed from the original175 TO HIS SISTER ANNA Paris, December 19, 1908, Dear Anyuta, Today I received your letter redirected from Geneva and a postcard through Manyasha.
And so everything is signed and sealed.
Excellent.
I wrote to you about correc-tions in the letter that was lost.
I shall repeat them.
I agree to toning it down in respect of Bazarov and Bogdanov; in respect of Yushkevich and Valentinov, it should not be toned down.
With regard to “fideism”, etc.
, I agree only if forced to, i.
e.
, if the publisher’s demands are in the form of an ultimatum.
As far as the proofs are concerned, it is not my plan to have them read here and keep people wait-ing for them to come from here.
That is hardly possible.
All I ask is that you send me immediately impressions made from the galleys (i.
e.
, the first uncorrected proofs in addi-tion to the printed signatures as they come off the press) so that I can, if really necessary, send a telegram or inform them of misprints, etc.
Cauwelaert’s name really should be spelt with an “o” in Russian, although he is probably a Fleming and the devil alone knows how the Flemings pronounce it, “co” or “cau”.
From Geneva I sent you a letter to the right address con-taining corrections and additions.
Did you get it? We are now moving from the hotel to our new apartment —Mr.

We have found a very nice apartment, very elegant and * au deuxième au-dessus de l’entresol, i.

expensive: 840 francs&tax (about 60 francs) and&con-cierge (also about the same per annum).
For Moscow it would be cheap (4 rooms&kitchen&storerooms, water and gas), but here it is considered expensive.
However, it will be roomy and, we hope, good.
Yesterday we bought furniture for Manyasha; ours is being sent from Geneva.
The apart-ment is almost on the outskirts of Paris, in the south, near Montsouris Park.
It is as quiet as a provincial town.
It is very far from here to the centre but soon there will be a métro—an underground electric railway—a couple of steps from here; there are also other means of communication.
So far we are satisfied with Paris.
All best wishes.
Regards from all.

Printed from the original176 TO HIS SISTER ANNA Rue Beaunier, 24, Paris (XIV-me) December 24, 1908 Dear Anyuta, Today I received your letter about the proofs and hasten to scribble a few words, though I believe my last letter cleared up all misunderstandings.
I never assumed and still do not assume that proofs would be sent here to be corrected—i.
e.
, with your having to wait for the corrected proofs to be returned from here.
I ask you to send me the proofs just in case, i.
e.
, either so that I can point out the misprints and arrange for the most important corrections, or so that I can stop the printing by telegraph in an emerg-ency, etc.
, or, lastly, so that I can have at least one printed copy by me in case of certain highly improbable happen-ings.
That is why I ask you to get two copies of the first (or of the second, or, better still, of the first and the second) proofs printed; one copy you will read while the other comes straight to me without anybody holding it up for anything.
I think such a thing is quite possible for the publisher; I shall not cause the slightest delay unless it is absolutely necessary.
If pulling off two copies involves any expense (which is hardly likely and there is no need for us to raise the question), I will bear it myself.
If you send the first proofs regularly, the delay will never amount to a week because in any case it takes several days to correct it completely and to print what hasbeen read (correction of the first proof; correction of the second proof; imposition; printing).
The publisher is exag-gerating when he talks about a week’s delay.
By the way—I will give you a telegraphic form to be used in case of need right away.
I shall write “arrêtez 12 or 65, etc.
”, arrêtez meaning “delay the printing”, or “wait for author’s corrections”, and the two figures meaning, the first figure the chapter, and the second the section (12= Chapter One, Section 2; 65= Chapter Six, Section 5, etc.
).
I repeat that I shall do this only in extreme cases.
Instead of printing the chapter headings in heavy type it is better, if possible, to set them in small type or in ital-ics.
This, however, is not important.
Has one of my letters with addenda and minor changes gone astray? I see from your letter you received corrections and addenda * regarding E.
Becher, but before this there was another letter containing corrections.
I am very, very glad that the matter is moving fast.
That is the main thing.
All the best.

Printed from the originalQP 177 TO HIS SISTER ANNA February 6, 1909 Dear Anyuta, Yesterday I sent you a letter in which I said I had com-pletely given up all hope of seeing the proofs and this morn-ing the first of them arrived! I am sending you a list of misprints (in general there are not many) in case you need it; it would be interesting to know whether it will reach you quickly and be in time.
I would rather not send the proofs themselves.
Кoллeкции instead of кoллeкцию (page 15, line 8 from the bottom of the manuscript; page 5, line 1 from the top of the galley).
Пpедпoлoжением instead of пpедпoлoжения (page 22, lines 3-4 from the bottom of the manuscript; page 7, lines 3-4 from the top of the galley).
Tелесные instead of те лесные (page 28, lines 6-7 from the top of the manuscript; page 9, line 3 from the top of the galley).
Змoций instead of злюций (page 36, lines 3-4 from the bottom of the manuscript; page 10, line 2 from the bottom of the galley).

267 Manyasha has been and still is eager to leave at once, but I think she now agrees to wait for a letter.
How is Mother now? I read Mitya’s letter and I ask him to write to us reg-ularly now; as a doctor he is better able to see, especially after consultations with specialists, what course the disease is taking and I ask him especially to inform us more often, even if only in a brief letter.
Please farm out the proofs— it is absolutely heartless to plant them on you at such a time.
You have the manuscript, so hire some student, etc.
, (or through the “writer” * , etc.
) as the last proof-reader, give him my address and don’t waste your attention on the correcting of proofs.
You have enough to worry about without that.

179 TO HIS SISTER ANNA Dear Anyuta, I am sending the corrections to the proofs I received today.
I have received: (α) page proofs for pages 97-112; (β) galley proofs 81-97 (pp.
302-364 of the manuscript), not made up.
But between the first and the second there is something missing; the made-up pages end at page 274 of the manu-script (there are also pp.
274a, 274e) and the galleys begin at page 302.
This means that about 7 pages of the manu-script have been left out! Does this not mean that a whole signature is missing? Could it have fallen out of the parcel? Or perhaps they forgot to send it or give it to you from the printer’s? Please send me the proofs of the missing pages (pp.
274-302 of the MS) and, under all circumstances, take steps to ensure that they are not left out when the book is made up and printed.
The missing part is most important for me and for my book.
Here is a description of the omission that is more accurate, according to the manuscript.
The last words of the last made-up page, number 112, are “These active forces must”.
In the manuscript this will be page 274, or 274a or 274b.
The gap comes after these words.
The missing part is from page 274a to page 302, to the words “Let us continue the quo-tation from Bazarov” inclusive, that is, to the third line from the top inclusive.
That is the exact size of the gap.
268 There is one other mistake, or rather not a mistake but something in the galleys that may lead to a mistake when they are made up into pages; seventeen lines from the bot-tom of galley No.
88, beginning from “гелем” (page 14 of the 4th German edition), etc.
(page 338 of the manu-script) must be transferred to the foot of galley No.
89.
In other words the words “Religious experience” (line 18 from the bottom of galley No.
88, line 6 from the top of page 334 of the manuscript) are followed by “гелем” (p.
14, etc.
), i.
e.
, page 338, line 7 from the top.
This must be watched carefully to make sure that there is no mistake when the pages are made up.
Please give the last proofs (and your correspondence with me) to someone who knows languages and pay him.
Let Mitya take one hundred rubles, go to the “writer” and hire* either the writer himself, or somebody he recommends for the work, to read the final proofs and get in touch with me.
This must be done because you now have no time for proofs, of course, and will only worry yourself to death.
Will you please do as I ask immediately.
Yesterday I wrote to you and Manyasha did, too.
Give Mother many kisses.
“Un peu mieux” is very indefinite.

Please send me the part that already has been printed immediately; I will make a list of the misprints.

180 TO HIS SISTER ANNA Dear Anyuta, Yesterday I received your letter with a postscript from dear Mother.
Manyasha and all of us were awfully glad.
Manyasha was more lively today and went out walking with Mark—today is mardi gras, 270 and the French are on the rampage.
Give Mother many kisses from me and from all of us—we all fervently hope that she will now get better with-out any setbacks.
Today I received the proofs of signatures 8 and 9 (pp.
113-144) already made up into pages and was very pleased to see that there are no gaps and no mixed galleys (which I wrote about last time before I had seen the proofs of the made-up pages; by the way, you send the packages without any string, and single pages and even whole signatures may easily fall out).
The proofs of these two signatures are, on the whole, quite good, and that gives me great pleasure.
I still cannot risk withdrawing my request to give the proofs to a profes-sional proof-reader (about which I wrote in the last letter), because I am afraid you will find it difficult to devote time to such boring work during Mother’s illness and to con-centrate your attention on it.
I am sending the corrections to the page proofs of signa-tures 8 and 9 (pp.
113-144).
When they begin to print the signatures, please send them to me from the first) so thatI can draw up a list of misprints that must be pointed out, even if only on a sheet pasted separately into the book.
All the best, and kiss Mother once more.

30, Obolensky Street, 5/7, Khamovniki, Moscow, Russia March 2, 1909 Dear Anyuta, Your letter and Mitya’s have reached me here—many thanks for them.
I wrote to you from Paris that the last proofs were excellent.
If Mother is better and you are not too tired I shall not, of course, insist that you pass on the proofs to someone else.
But are you not too worn out? I was glad to learn from Mitya’s letter that Mother is better! At last—she must have had a rough time.
Please send proofs as before, not only the page proofs, but the galley proofs as well (it does not matter if I correct them an extra time; the fewer mistakes the better).
Please send the printed signatures at once to Paris, too.
I am taking a holiday in Nice.
The place is wonderful— sunny, warm, dry and a southern sea.
I am returning to Paris in a few days.

1 Printed from the original182 TO HIS SISTER ANNA March 9, 1909 Dear Anyuta, I arrived in Paris yesterday evening (after a splendid holiday in Nice) and read your letter of the 16th.
I am sending corrections to signatures 10 and 11 of the made-up pages.
Only two are of importance.
The title of Bogdanov’s book is Empirio-monism and not Empirio-crit-icism.
This misprint must be given special prominence in the list of errata if it is too late to correct it * (I do not know whether you received my postcard from Nice—I sent two from there—in which I mentioned this misprint).
The other is on page 170, line 9 from the top—in the quotation from Plekhanov the word “зту” is unnecessary.
As regards giving the proofs to someone else—you are right, of course, to take all the necessary steps, because it would have been extremely difficult to combine such painstaking and tedious work with the job of nursing Mother.
I can only express my amazement that the last proofs could be exemplary under such working conditions.
It is most important to me to get the book out as quickly as possible.
There has been a very great delay.
It will be unfortunate if it does not come out by March 15 (O.
S.
)! As far as breach of contract is concerned, I don’t know whether you can make a claim.
I doubt it.
And is it worth while spoiling relations with the publisher irrevocably? It is not.
* The misprint was corrected in a list of errata at the back of the book.
—Ed.
Is the absence of proofs in recent days due partially to your having stopped sending them on account of my trip? I hope that, and not a delay in setting and printing, is the reason.
Please send everything now.
I see from Mitya’s letter that Mother’s health is improving.
At last! Many kisses for Mother and very best regards to all.

Please do not tone down the places against Bogda-nov and against Lunacharsky’s popovshchina.
We have com-pletely broken off relations with them.
There is no reason for toning them down, it is not worth the trouble.

Give the “writer” a thousand thanks for consenting to help.
It seems, after all, he is a real Marxist and not a “Marxist for an hour” like some others.

183 TO HIS SISTER ANNA March 12, 1909 Dear Anyuta, Today I received the clean proofs of signatures 1-9 and 13—“clean” because they are on good paper and have apparently already been printed, although they have a stamp at the top of each signature (put on by the printer) saying “proof”, which I do not understand.
Whatever the case may be, whether they are proofs or whether they are copies of signatures already printed, I must say that the jumbled paragraphs have been completely corrected and that, in general, these clean proofs are thor-oughly satisfactory.
I am now thinking of one thing and one thing only and I beg you—speed up the issue of the book.
Things have now been properly organised, the proofs are excellent, but hurry, hurry, at all costs, for there has already been a devilishly long, an impossible delay.
If, therefore, there is anything whatsoever hindering you, you must immediately hire an assistant proof-reader (if you have not yet done so).
I am sending a list of misprints that have not been cor-rected but which were pointed out in my previous correc-tions; this list is only for signatures 6-9 and for signature 13 (I will send the list relating to the first live signatures tomorrow or the day after because I have given the proofs to someone and must ask for them back).
These misprints absolutely must be shown in a list of errata at the end or the beginning of the book because there are some that distort the meaning.
On the whole there areso few misprints that under no circumstances must the book be delayed on account of them.
I have not seen signatures 10, 11 and 12 (pp.
145-192) made up into pages; for this reason I shall send the list of misprints for those signatures separately.
I am heading them exactly—list of misprints for such-and-such made-up printer’s signatures.
The book must be published without waiting for my last list of misprints but with this present list printed under the heading of errata.
The most important—p.

Please do not tone down anything in the places against Bogdanov, Lunacharsky and Co.
They must not be toned down.
You have deleted the passage about Chernov being a “more honest” opponent than they, which is a great pity.
The shade of meaning you have given it is not the one I want.
There is now no overall consistency in my accusations.
The crux of the issue is that our Machists are dishonest, mean-spirited, cowardly enemies of Marxism in philosophy.

184 TO HIS SISTER ANNA March 21, 1909 Dear Anyuta, As you probably know from the newspapers there is a post office strike going on here.

I am not getting the proofs (I have received nothing since the page proofs of signature 13).
In any case I am sending this by registered post and ask you to send a registered reply too.
(1) I am sending a list of misprints in signatures 1-5.
(2) I am sending a correction to p.
630 of the MS.
* (3) Please include this in the errata; footnote at the beginning of Section 6 of Chapter Three (i.
e.
, the section on freedom and necessity)—instead of “not only a smile” read “not a smile, but disgust”.
This is an essential correction and if it is not made my idea will be distorted; I do not see anything funny in flirt-ing with religion, but I see a lot that is disgusting.
I have already written about not, under any circumstan-ces, toning down the passages against Bogdanov and Lu-nacharsky in the second half of the book and hope you have received the letters.
Especially—do not throw out “Purish-kevich” and the others in the section on the criticism of Kantianism! * This correction has been lost.

At last! An excellent proletarian affair was seriously interfering with our literary affairs.

I still have not received your proofs and the made-up pages.
I have seen the clean proofs of signatures 1-9 (pp.
1-144) and signature 13 (pp.
193-208) only.
I have not seen any proofs after Section 6 of Chapter Three (the beginning).
The postman, to be sure, gives us hope—the sacs de Russie that were not opened during the strike will be opened and delivered today or tomorrow.
I am afraid to hope! Nevertheless I am very, very glad that there is progress, that signatures 19 and 20 have now been made up and the end must he near.
It has been a great strain on my nerves waiting for this long drawn-out book.
I am sending an addendum.
Do not hold up the book for it.
But if there is time, let them print it in different type (in smaller type, for instance) at the very end of thebook.
I regard it as extremely important to counterpose Chernyshevsky to the Machists.

187 TO HIS SISTER ANNA April 5, 1909 Dear Anyuta, Yesterday I received the made-up pages of signatures 14-20 (pp.

e.
, pp.
177-192) and today I got galleys 226-234 (pp.
784-809 of the MS).
I am sending the misprints in signature 14 (pp.
209-224) —the misprints in the other signatures have already been sent—and corrections to the galleys.
Actually there is one important correction here; in galley 234 (end of the first paragraph in Section 7 “on a Russian ‘idealist physicist’”) —page 809 of the manuscript—the words “materialist and thinker, Professor V.
I.
Vernadsky” have been set.
This completely distorts the meaning.
It should read “natural scientist and thinker”, etc.
273 If it is too late to correct it, there absolutely must be a notice of this misprint on a separate sheet since it distorts the meaning.
In answer to your question “where to put pages 802a and 802b and where are they? They are not in the manu-script”—those pages were sent separately (from Geneva) and they must be placed as a footnote to the word “object” on line 7 in the paragraph (in Section 6) that begins with the words “Rey became muddled because” (this is galley 232 and page 802 of the manuscript).
* * The footnote was included (Collected Works, Vol.

In any case (i.

I hope you have received them.
This morning I received clean proofs of signatures 10, 11 and 12 and the page proofs of signature 21.
I am sending the misprints that must be printed in the book in a special list of errata.
It is a great pity that I have to send the misprints in small doses (see P.
S.
); I am afraid that some of the separate pages containing lists of misprints may get lost.
Perhaps you will paste them together as you receive them and give them to the printer all at once? As far as money is concerned—please send it on to me all at once (I am now in need of money); it is best done through the bank, specifically, through the Crédit Lyon-nais.
To prevent the people here from charging too much for the exchange it is best to buy francs in Moscow and send the exact sum to the Crédit Lyonnais in Paris, Agence Z, Avenue d’Orléans, 19, addressed to Mr.

* In connection with the publication of the book I have two important requests to make of you.
(1) The experience of the previous month shows that the publisher and printer are capable of delaying the remaining four of five signatures for a long, long time, but it is hellishly important to me for the book to appear sooner.
I have not only literary but also serious political commit-ments that are linked up with the publication of the book.
274 I therefore beg you to engage an assistant for yourself (or for the “writer”, if you hand it over to him) to pay special visits to the printers and keep urging them along.
It is not difficult, of course, to find a student for about fifteen rubles a week—there will be crowds of candidates for such a post.

proofs from there, bring them back corrected without delay, will follow up the work day by day, etc.
I do not grudge 100 rubles for this.
You must do this or tell the “writer” to do it, for it will be the end of me if the book is delayed until the second half of April.
(2) I have now sent you the misprints in all the 22 sig-natures.
Let them set a list of those misprints immediately and send me a proof; there will be time enough and it is very important to me because the book must be well pro-duced.

We were all greatly pleased to learn that you are staying in the Crimea and at last having a fairly decent holiday.
This is how matters stand with Manyasha.
She has put her name down for the examinations 275 and is now zealously swotting.
We have to wait for the results—in a few weeks it will be known whether she will finish her examinations successfully.
I have no doubt that she will, for she works very conscien-tiously.
She is now quite well.
Now and again we drag her out for walks—not long ago we took her to the forest at Clamart, a few versts from Paris, where the air is wonder-ful.
The best thing, of course, would be for her to stay here for another winter and for all of us to live together.
We shall have to try to arrange that as soon as the examinations are over.
We are going for a holiday in the summer (some-where near the end of June or the beginning of July, I think) —we shall take her along with us—and then in the autumn she will wait for you here and in Paris we shall all be beau-tifully provided for.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you have a good holiday.

I have received the book and find that it has been nicely published.
There were no fewer misprints at the end than at the beginning and the proof-reader’s ignorance of foreign languages is obvious (the English “A New Name for Old Ways of Thinking” * has been so distorted that it is ridic-ulous), 277 but that is an inevitable and insignificant short-coming.
On the whole I am satisfied with it.
Everyone complains of the price—and rightly so.
In future we shall have a point in the contract about the price as well as the number of copies.
I was hard pressed by the publisher and would, in any case, have agreed to any terms, as long as the book was published, The publisher has not yet sent any money and I am beginning to be afraid that he will swindle us.
278 I have written to Peres.
Will you also please write to the publish-er—three or four weeks have passed and he promised to pay in a week.
(You absolutely must get a promissory note for the remaining sum.
) Please send me the five hun-dred rubles that are in the bank (Crédit Lyonnais, Agence Z, Avenue d’Orléans, 19.

Ulyanov Dear Anya, You asked in your last letter why I do not write.
All this winter I have been in a state of utter melancholy, the time has been frittered away, I could not work properly and so I was in no fit state to write.
If Manyasha had not written about Volodya and Volodya about her I should have given you all the details about them both as I did before, but apart from that there is nothing to write, we are just jogging along.
Every time they wrote I told them to give you my regards but I don’t suppose they did.
I shall try and write soon, but in the meantime I send many kisses to you and to dear Maria Alexandrovna from myself and from Mother.

Printed from the original192 TO HIS BROTHER Dear Mitya, Manyasha has already written to you about her illness.
I also want your advice.
The doctor has diagnosed that she has inflammation of the gut projecting from the caecum (that’s appendicitis, isn’t it?).
I asked a very good local surgeon and he confirmed it.
He advises an operation.
Everyone says it is not dangerous and effects a radical cure.
The surgeon (Dr.
Dubouchez) is praised by everybody.
He recently performed an operation (the same one) on the wife of a friend—it was excellent, a teaspoonful of blood, in eight days she began to get about.
The hospital is a good one.
The attacks are not very bad now.
There is no high tem-perature.
The pains are not great.
Please answer me imme-diately—I am in favour of an operation but am afraid to take the risk without your advice.
Answer immediately.
There is no doubt that they perform good operations here.
The doctor does not advise her to travel before the operation.
I shall not write to Mother because I am afraid of frighten-ing her for no good reason.
There is no danger, Manyasha does not even stay in bed all the time.
Nor shall I write to Anyuta because Mother may read it.
Please write to Mark and through him to Anyuta (if you can do it without scaring Mother).
It will probably be better not to write to the Crimea at all because they will get frightened.
And so I await an answer; here they advise us to get the operation done quickly.
Do you also? All the best, Yours, V.

1 1 Printed from the original193 TO HIS MOTHER July 19, 1909 Dear Mother, Today I received your picture postcard of the Crimea (the postcard was enclosed in an envelope with a corner cut off; this greatly surprised us—did you do it or the local post office?).
You ask about money for Manyasha.
I answered your last letter, but not immediately (we were moving to a new apartment at the time), so that your postcard and my letter crossed in the post.
I offered Manyasha some money since I have some.
She refused absolutely to take it; she said she did not need it and showed me the 70 francs she had.
We are going to Brittany for our holiday, probably next Saturday.
Y.
V.
has already gone there.
Manyasha is recov-ering rapidly; now I can tell you everything that happened —she had appendicitis, that is, inflammation of the gut projecting from the caecum.
If the disease is caught in time it is not at all dangerous and can be completely cured by an operation.
After consulting Mitya and the best doctors here, we decided on an immediate operation.
We put Manyasha into a surgical hospital for a week (it was a very good hospital).
The operation was very successful; Manyasha came out of hospital in a week and has been at home for three days.
She now walks and eats everything.
She is convalescing rapidly.
She felt better as soon as the appendix was removed.
She will be able to travel by rail at the end of the week and we are thinking of leaving for Brit-tany together.
And there is nothing to worry about, It is a good thing that Manyasha had her operation here because the surgeons here are excellent.
Chronic appendicitis would still be troubling her and would trouble her for a long time if she had not had the operation.
Now she is quite well.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good health.
Do not be angry with me for not having written about Manyasha immediately.

1 1 Printed from the original194 TO HIS MOTHER August 24, 1909 Mother dearest, I received your letter yesterday and am answering by return of post.
There is no need at all for you to worry about Manyasha.
She is convalescing splendidly.
She can’t, of course, walk about much yet; she still has some pain in her leg (the right one).
We asked the doctors in Paris and here in the country whether that was a bad sign.
They all say “no”.
They say she is convalescing well, if somewhat slowly.
They advise Manyasha to wear a bandage so that the scar is not shaken so much when she walks.
Yesterday she walked five or six versts, slept excellently afterwards and feels quite well.
Generally speaking, she looks incomparably better, she has a good appetite, sleeps well and looks perfectly healthy.
In short—I am being quite frank—everything is going well although rather slow-ly, probably because of the great fatigue she experienced in winter.
We are having a good holiday here.
We have been here three weeks and expect to be here another two, or perhaps three.
I cannot yet say whether Manyasha will be able to travel to Russia in a month’s time.
She has recovered very considerably during her three weeks’ holi-day.
I advise her to drink as much milk as she can and to eat curds and whey.
She prepares the curds and whey herself, but in my opinion she is not feeding herself up enough; I am always quarreling with her on those grounds.
Our rooms here are good, and the board is good and not expensive (10 francs a day for the four of us).
Nadya and I often go cycling.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and wish you good health.

U.
We all send our regards.

Today I got a note from Manyasha, who writes that she wants to take a cure.
I also got the book (Kriticheskoye Obozreniye) she sent.
Manyasha writes that you are still living in furnished rooms.
That must be extremely inconvenient.
It will be a good thing if you can soon move into the flat you found with the aid of your acquaintances.
Mitya will probably visit you in Moscow when he hears of Manyasha’s arrival.
I should like him to drop me a line telling me how he finds Manyasha and which doctor (or doctors) he wishes to consult about her.
There are no changes here.
We are all well and send our regards.

How are things in the new apartment? Is it warm there? Our apartment with central heating has turned out to be too warm—although it may be because of the warm weather we are having here.
Manyasha did right to go to a competent doctor—she must now follow his advice exactly.
I have received Rossiya.
281 Many thanks.
I have also had word from the historian—he must be a very narrow person.
It is a pity that he intends writing nonsense! It seems as if we shall have to give him up for lost.

4, Bozheninsky Street, Devichye Polye, Moscow, Russia Dear Manyasha, Today I received an issue of Utro Rossii with the vulgar nonsense about Gorky.
284 For some days now a number of newspapers in Paris (L’Éclair) and in Berlin (Berliner Tageblatt) 285 have been engaged in similar lies.
Some days ago there was a good refutation of this mass of lies in Vor-wärts, where it was very correctly demonstrated and very wittily explained that this is all one big nonsensical inven-tion.
Some fool heard rumours he did not understand and got everything wrong—scraps he had picked up about ot-zovism, the school, philosophy and so on.
Utro Rossii must be a shady little rag to have cooked up an “interview” just for the sake of sensation.
Today Rech is also engaged in the fabrication of similar scandal.
The Cadets are happy to have something to lie and talk scandal about.
How are you? How is Mother? I have had no news from you for quite a while.
Write and let me know how you are getting on, what you are doing, and how Mitya is.
There have been no changes here.

Today I received a second letter from Manyasha with the pleasant news that there is no need for me to write to our acquaintance a second time.
I am worried that your apartment is so cold; what will it be like in winter if the temperature is only 12° now? You must not catch cold.
.
.

Is there nothing you can do? Perhaps you should put in a small stove.
That is often done here (we do not need it because we have steam heating and it is very warm), and we did it in Siberia.
So far there has been no great cold, here, at any rate, but the winter is still to come.
I am very, very grateful to Manyasha for the news.
If she should have an opportunity I should very much like her to obtain for me the new Moscow agricultural statistics (1907-09) and to find out (even from a shop) how much Iz-vestiya zemleustroitelnykh komissii costs; I cannot get this publication through acquaintances and I need it.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you are keeping well.

4, Bozheninsky Street, Devichye Polye, Moscow, Russia Dear Manyasha, I recently learned, quite by accident, that there is to be a congress of statisticians in Moscow at Christmas— or rather one of the sections of the congress of doctors and naturalists will be congress of statisticians.
287 I have already heard the names of a couple of acquaintances who will be there (one from Moscow, the other from the prov-inces), and no doubt there will be more than two acquaint-ances there.
It is extremely important to take advantage of this to get me the Zemstvo statistical publications.
I urge you to try to find at least one statistician of your acquaintance at the congress and give him my address and my request to send me Zemstvo statistical publications: (1) on peasant and landowner farms—especially current statistics and house-to-house censuses; (2) handicraftsmen and industry; (3) on the law of November 9, 1906 288 and on the acquisition of commune lands by peasants.
I think you may give my address direct.
If they say that they can-not send them abroad, please give your address and I will send you the money, so that you can send the statistics on to me.
They are absolutely essential to me.
If it will be of any use I can write a brief appeal to the statisticians (I am sending one for you to use at your own discretion), 289 so that statisticians of your acquaintance can distributeit (or show it) to those from other towns, adding their own request (or trying to get consent) to send the publications.
Drop me a line if you find someone who can do it.
If you do not, I shall write to you again.
The publication I wrote about last time is not called Izvestiya zemleustroitelnykh komissii (although I have heard that such a publication exists too) but Izvestiya Zemskogo Otdela (Ministry of the Interior).
Is there any civil servant of your acquaintance who can acquire this work? All the best to you, kiss Mother.

I am very, very glad that you have made quite good arrangements and that Mother is pleased that there is no housekeeping for her to do.
Let us hope that the end of winter will not disappoint us.
Up to now the winter here has been more like spring than winter.
Today, for instance, has been a real spring day, sunny, dry and warm, and Nadya and I took advantage of it for a wonderful morning excursion to the Bois do Boulogne.
In general we have made good use of the holidays—we have been to museums, the theatre and the Musée Grévin, 290 which gave us much pleasure.
This evening I intend to go to an estaminet to listen to a “goguette révolutionnaire ” * by “songsters” (an unhappy translation of chansonniers).
I am sorry I did not make use of my jawing with Frenchmen in summer to study French pronunciation systematically— now that I have got some books on phonetics I can see how weak I am.

205 TO HIS BROTHER February 13, 1910 Dear Mitya, It is quite a while since I received your letter (and later Niva with the problem 295 ) and, I am ashamed to say, I have kept putting off answering.
How goes the convales-cence? I hope that doctors are cautious and do not allow themselves to start work until they have fully recovered.
I have often thought of the danger of accidents when I have been riding my bicycle through the centre of Paris, where the traffic is simply hellish.
But to fall out like you did, in the country and in the middle of winter! It must have been a pretty wild horse and you were probably driving hell for leather, eh? Drop me a line to let me know whether you have recov-ered.
Anyuta wrote that there is a hope of the leg mending (completely or not? Will you be able to ride a bicycle?) but not the shoulder.
Is that true? I cannot quite believe that it is absolutely impossible to mend a broken shoulder-blade.
You must start a proper course of treatment and keep it up until you are completely cured.
With regard to Manyasha—I think it would be good for her to have a longer rest in summer.
Mother says the same, but is afraid she will not be able to drag her out.
.

She should, however.
Life here goes on as usual.
We live a quiet life.

All the best.
Get better soon and properly.

I have so few opportunities to play here that I have probably forgotten everything.
I was very pleased to learn that you are satisfied with your flat and with the landlady, and that you are better and have begun to go out.
It would be good if you could get out of Moscow earlier in spring and go to somewhere on the Volga or to the country.
It is sure to be unpleasant in Moscow in spring.
We are having wonderful weather.

With regard to my grudge against the doctor * (whom you asked me to do something to help) you were quite wrong, or perhaps I accidentally said something tactless.
I have never had and still do not have the slightest grudge against him.
He makes a good impression.
We never got to know each other closely.
Now he has moved out of town, where the children will be better off.
He is in very poor circum-stances; he has only just managed to find some temporary work for the tiniest imaginable emolument.
I very seldom see him.
The émigrés here are very poor.
My work is going extremely badly.
I hope to get over this period of intense squabbling 297 and will then return to my work.
All the best.

Best wishes from all.

Dear Anya, I received your letter about our acquaintance a long time ago and answered it immediately in a letter to Manya-sha.
I have certain reasons for thinking that my letter was lost, although Manyasha answered one of the questions raised in it.
I asked her to write and say whether she had received that letter but she hasn’t written.
The acquaintance to whom you asked me to show the letter is not here now and, furthermore, what I wrote to you was not said to him but to another person.
I will write in detail in a few days.
Many kisses.

QQQ 215 TO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW January 3, 1911 Dear M.
T.
, Many thanks for your letter.
One feels so cut off here that your stories of impressions and observations of the Volga (how I miss the Volga!) are manna from heaven.
Your observations are of the greatest interest because they tell me about the various people you meet in the way of business and on journeys and because you made them without any preconceived aim.
I was also very pleased to get your letter in the summer and I am very much at fault for not having found time to answer it, but that was because of moving from the seaside to Paris and from Paris to Copenhagen and Stockholm.
As regards my trip to Italy—it seems that it will not come off now (or in the near future).
Finances (Anya asked me about them, by the way) do not permit it.
I have not found a publisher.
301 I sent an article to Sovremenny Mir, 302 but apparently there are difficulties there, too; several weeks have passed and there has been no answer.
Long journeys will have to be put off until better times.
It is, of course, only a stone’s throw from here to Italy and you simply must pay a visit to Paris if you intend going to Italy.
I suppose it is not for nothing that people say that if you have once been to Paris you will be drawn to it again.
Manyasha would certainly do better to take a longer rest in Saratov and not hurry off anywhere, it would be better in all respects.
Life here goes on as usual.
Very little that is pleasant.
The recent period has been so “squabblesome” that I must ask you to forgive me for unpunctuality in correspondence;I have not answered Anyuta, who told me of the unsuccess-ful talks with Lvovich, 303 and I have not written to Mother for a long time.
Now at least you have almost the entire family gathered together, so please make my excuses, give my best regards to Anya and Manyasha and kiss Mother many times.
All the best, Yours, V.
U.
In Stockholm Mother told me about your fight with your boss.

Nadya thanks you very much for it and sends her regards.
As for me, I am hurrying to correct the misunderstanding which, it seems, I was the unwitting cause of.
Please do not send me any money.
I am not now in need.
I wrote that neither my book nor my article had been accepted—that was in one of my recent letters.
But in the last letter I wrote that they say that my article will be accepted.
I have written to Gorky * about the book and hope for a favourable reply.
In any case my situation is not now any worse; at the moment I am not in need, I beg you, my dear, not to send anything and not to try to save anything from your pension.
If things get bad I will write quite frankly, but at the moment they are not.
It is not easy to find a publisher, but I shall keep on seeking—furthermore, I continue to receive the “sala-ry” 305 I told you about in Stockholm.
So please do not worry.

On the occasion of your name day I congratulate you and Manyasha.
I hope you will soon be well—com-pletely recovered.
Today I saw the doctor * —the father of Anyuta’s “godson”—and he says that after an attack of lumbago you have to take great care of yourself to prevent a relapse.
By the way—his wife and children intend coming to Russia, but for the summer they want to go to the country.
I received your letter describing life in Saratov and expressing some ideas about Manyasha, my dear.
Do not worry in advance, perhaps things may turn out quite differ-ently from what you imagine by the time summer is over.
Where are you thinking of spending the summer? In Saratov itself? Is it a good place for the summer? For a week we have had real winter weather here, snow and frost.
Now there has been a new turn to spring.

We are greatly enjoying these dainties and thinking of the Volga as we eat them.
You really have been plying us with dainties from home this year! How are you getting on? To judge by the newspapers it is cold and snowing where you are.
It is spring here.
A week ago I got my bicycle out again and went to the Bois des Verrières (that is where Manyasha went) and brought back some bursting willow buds.
I went there again today with Nadya—the cherries are already in bloom.

Among our people here, by the way, there is more bickering and abuse of each other than there has been for a long time— there probably never has been so much before.
All the groups and sub-groups have joined forces against the last confer-ence and those who organised it so that matters even went as far as fisticuffs at meetings here.
308 In short, there is so little here that is interesting or even pleasant that it’s not worth writing.

I congratulate you and Manyasha on the occasion of your name day; I embrace you fondly and wish you.
everything of the best.
What is spring on the Volga like this year? Are you all keeping well? I have got into the habit of looking every day in Rech to see what the weather, in Saratov is like and I see that it is still cold.
It seems that we are having an early spring here this year.
Some days ago I again went cycling in the woods— the fruit trees in the orchards are all covered in white, “as though bathed in milk”, and such a wonderful perfume—a really delightful spring! It is a pity I cycled alone; Nadya has caught cold, has lost her voice and has to stay at home.
In summer we intend going to Fontenay, near Paris, and are thinking of moving there altogether.
309 Paris is expensive, rents have gone up.
Besides, it will probably be healthier and quieter in the suburbs.
I want to go and look for something soon.
We expected a long letter from Manyasha, but did not get one.
I am sending her a prospectus, all that I could find.
How are Mark and Anya keeping? What news is there from Mitya? Again many kisses and best regards to all.

4 Printed from the original224 TO HIS MOTHER May 27, 1912 Mother dearest, I returned to Paris yesterday from a short business trip 310 and found your letter with the bad news about Anya and Manyasha.
311 I am sure they will not be able to hold them long because the absurdity of such an arrest is obvi-ous.
Things have come to such a pass that they say straight out to Anyuta “Not for long!” In the provinces today they probably pick up people for no reason at all, “just in case”.
Have you any acquaintances, my dear? Does anybody visit you? Sudden loneliness is the worst thing that can happen at such times.
Do you get letters and news from Mitya and Mark? Have you any acquaintances in St.
Petersburg? It would be a good idea to write to them, if there are any, and tell them about what has happened, perhaps they can get some information.
Sometimes the provincial administration is overzealous, especially now, after May Day.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and hope you keep well and active.

There is something else I want to talk to you about.
I am afraid you must feel very lonely now.
I asked in my last letter whether any acquaintances visit you but I could not have received an answer to that letter yet.
I read in a St.
Petersburg newspaper today about the large number of arrests and house searches that have been made in connection with the case of the railwaymen 312 in Saratov.
They seem to be picking up people left and right.

I don’t know whether you have yet managed to get any news of Manya and Anyuta.
You will probably be seeing Anyuta soon, because when they arrested her they said it would not be for long.
If the arrests are on a very big scale, however, it may take some time simply to sort out all the people who have been arrested.
Please drop me a line, my dear, to let me know if you are well, how you are feeling, and if there is any news and whether you have any acquaintances in Saratov.
Perhaps you will feel a little less miserable if we write to one another more often.
There are no changes here.

This summer we have moved a long way from Paris—to Krakow.
Almost in Russia! Even the Jews are like Russians and the Russian frontier is 8 versts away (the journey by train from Granice to here takes two hours, from Warsaw 9 hours), the women go barefoot and wear brightly-coloured clothes, exactly as in Russia.

Regards to Mark! Please send me Mitya’s address, my dear.

Your hand must have been very painful for a long time—your writing is still weak.

I hope it will be easier for us to meet, too— as long as there is no war; I do not greatly believe there will be one.
I receive very occasional news from Gorky, who is now less unfriendly in his attitude towards us than he was.
How are Mark and Mitya? Give Mother many, many kisses from me.

Nadya will write you in detail about our way of life.

Send her Nadya’s letter and mine if they are of interest to her.
I do not think you need worry about her; Vologda is bet-ter than Astrakhan as far as climate is concerned (infectious diseases are worse and more dangerous in Astrakhan); she will make friends with people.
After all, the town is not far from Petersburg and Moscow.
The St.
Petersburg papers probably arrive only a day late.
It is difficult to arrange for any translation work; some contact must be established with publishers in Moscow or St.
Petersburg.
Nadya suggests what I think is a good idea— write to the Sabashnikovs.
** Perhaps Anyuta will also write to Krumbügel (if it is possible), etc.
I, alas, have no contacts with publishers.
How is it that Mark is so often ill? That’s no good! He should take a rest in summer, for instance, in the moun-tains—four hours’ journey from here there is Zakopane, they say it is a wonderful place in the mountains.
We are not thinking of moving; unless the war chases us away, but I do not greatly believe in the war.

Why is he so poorly these days? What was he like when you left—was he, on the whole, well? I suppose you are now suffering from “prison anaemia”, or rather from a worsening of your former anaemia.
You ought to do something about it—go skating, for instance.
That is something you must do, so do not neglect it! There is slush where I am now, but last year, when I found my-self in a “cold” place, I immediately found a skating rink and had a go to see whether I had forgotten how to skate.

In this place, unfortunately, I am cut off from all contact with publishers.

234 TO HIS SISTER ANNA Dear Anyuta, It is quite a while since I had news of you.
Is Mother keeping well? Have you received the letter I sent immedia-tely on receiving the “goodies”? It seems that the amnesty did not affect the exiles in Vologda at all.

316 Is there any news from Mitya or Mark in their new places? Do you know the address of Krumbügel—he published my book on philosophy? Is it possible to get hold of him (if you tell me how to find him I can probably get an acquaintance in Moscow to do it) and find out whether there are any unsold copies of the book left? We could now prob-ably find another means of disposing of them and could come to an agreement on the subject with the publisher.

Written during the first half of April, 1 9 1 3 Sent from Krakow to Vologda First published in the Fourth Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original236 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S MOTHER May 3 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, We have received your postcards and I am very glad to know that you are having a good rest.

Austria.
We shall be leaving in three days.
The packing was an awful nuisance but as we are going to Poronin for five months we had to buy everything.
I am quite invalided and tire very quickly.
I have been going for electric treatment for a whole month, the swelling in my neck has not gone down but my eyes have become more normal and the pal-pitation is less.
Treatment is free here in the nerve clinic and the doctors are very attentive.
There is another advan-tage.
While you are waiting your turn, you hear Polish spo-ken and speak yourself.
I certainly want to learn Polish.
In summer I shall have spare time and will read Polish books.
We shall probably have a help in for four or five hours a day in summer and I shall have less to bother about.
Mother did not go to Russia.
Partly because of my illness and partly because there was no one to accompany her.
But mostly because of my illness.
In the last few days she has grown very tired from all the commotion in the house.
Volodya has been away and was not home for his birthday or for the holidays.
The journey made a good break for him.
317 I do not yet know whether there is anywhere to bathe in Poronin.
Volodya is very fond of bathing—there will be no bath there and he will not be able to take a shower.
I want to get to the country as soon as possible.
We live on the outskirts of the town, there are market gardens opposite our windows and the day before yesterday a night-ingale was singing, but still it is a town, the children shout, soldiers are riding to and fro and the carts are noisy.
Well, I embrace you and Anya fondly and send regards to all.
Is it possible that Anya’s finger still hurts? Mother sends regards.
Yours, Nadya Mother dearest, I am adding a couple of words to Nadya’s letter.
I must apologise for not having written, but I have been away for a couple of days and now we are moving.
Many thanks to Mitya for the letter.
3 1 8 I have also received a very long and interesting letter from Mark.
I will reply to it from Poronin.
Poronin is the station before Zakopane (a spa).
There are direct coaches to Zakopane—from Warsaw second class and from Granice third class.
I embrace you fondly and send best regards to all.

4 Printed from the original237 TO HIS SISTER MARIA Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, Yekaterininsko-Dvoryanskaya Street, 40, Vologda, Russia Dear Manyasha, I believe I am in debt to you (to Mark Timofeyevich I most certainly am).
At long last I have settled down to write.
We moved here a few days ago (partly because of Nadya’s illness—she has thyroid trouble which worries me greatly) to spend the summer in the village of Poronin, in the mountains seven kilometres from Zakopane.
It is near the Tatra Mountains, * 6-8 hours by rail to the south of Krakow and communication with Russia and Europe is through that town.
It is farther from Russia, but that can’t be helped.
We have rented a country house (a huge one, far too big!) for the whole summer up to October 1 (New Style) and after a lot of bother and bustle have moved.
I think Nadya is worse from the moving.
I shall probably have to take her to Berne for treatment.
.
.
.
This is a marvellous place.
The air is wonderful—the altitude is about 2,300 feet.
Our rather damp situation on the plains at Krakow cannot be compared to it.
We have plenty of newspapers and can work.
* The Tatras are part of the Carpathians, 8,500 feet high.
Pure Switzerland!The local people are Polish peasants, “Hurals” (moun-taineers), with whom I converse * in incredibly broken Polish, a language of which I know five words, and the rest in distorted Russian.
Nadya speaks a little Polish and can read the language.
The villages are almost Russian in type.
Thatched roofs, poverty.
The women and children go barefoot.
The men wear the Hural costume, white cloth trousers and coats, half jacket and half cape, of the same material.
This is not a holiday resort (Zakopane is) and, therefore, very quiet.
I still hope that Nadya will get better in the quiet and the mountain air.
We have started leading the rural life here—we get up early and go to bed almost with the roosters.
We walk every day to the post office and the station.
Do you see Pravda and Prosveshcheniye regularly? 319 The people here were glad to see the anniversary issue 320 and to hear of the metalworkers’ victory over the liquidators.
321 How are you? Will you be able to keep your lessons for the summer? Do you get enough books? Greetings to Polish friends, ** and I hope they help you in every way.

The house in Poronin (Poland) in which Lenin lived in the summer of 1913 and 1914238 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S MOTHER May 25 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, We received your letter today.
I hasten to reply to it.
I am getting better now.
The palpitation has become less violent.
I am following the doctor’s advice and eating enough for three, guzzling milk and taking Robin’s thyroid medicine and, in general, everything is fine.
Volodya gets very worked up, people worry him a lot about Kocher.
I am very glad that D.
I.
has written him a letter telling him that there is no need for an operation, etc.
, because people are talking all sorts of nonsense to him—that I may go blind, that I should lie motionless for eighteen months and so on.
I have not got the disease in such an advanced stage and I shall recover in the summer.
Our real holiday is only just beginning.
There was a ter-rible hurly-burly over the moving, and here at first we had to haggle.
The people here have been spoiled by holi-daymakers—they lie, swindle, etc.
At first we were angry at this, but now everything is in its place.
A girl comes to us; she cannot cook, but does all the household chores.
Today the weather shows signs of changing; so far we have had a whole week of rain, but the place does not seem damp.
This morning Volodya and I walked for about two hours, and now he has gone off alone to some indefinite point in space.
Every morning a fluffy black pup comes running to us from the neighbour’s and Volodya spends a lot of time playing with it.
This is the real summer cottage routine.
There is only one family here with whom we areacquainted and they live a long way away, half an hour’s walk.
But that does not prevent us from seeing each other, sometimes twice a day.
I am glad there are no crowds here.
I do a minimum amount of work.
I read mostly Polish novels, and not very enthusiastically at that.
It is very beautiful here.
Fortunately you cannot do a lot of cycling, because Volodya used to abuse that amuse-ment and overtire himself; it is better to walk more.
Mother sends regards.
She is still feeling miserable— her sister with whom she was brought up and with whom she had maintained close relations all her life, died a fort-night ago.
Mother even wanted to go to Novocherkassk when she heard of her sister’s illness, but she had no pass-port—it had been sent in for renewal.
Many kisses for Anya, and regards to all.
Volodya will probably write himself.
I embrace you fondly, my dear.
Yours, Nadya Mother dearest, I embrace you fondly and send regards to all.
Many thanks to Mitya for the letters.
I am trying to persuade Nadya to go to Berne.
She does not want to.
She is now slightly better.

1 1 Printed from the original242 TO HIS MOTHER Saturday, July 26, 1918 Mother dearest, After a fortnight’s “preparation” in the clinic, Nadya was at last operated on on Wednesday.
The operation seems to have been successful because she looked quite well yes-terday, and had begun to drink willingly.
It seems to have been a rather difficult operation, they tormented Nadya for about three hours without an anaesthetic, but she bore it bravely.
On Thursday she was very bad, a high temper-ature and delirium, so I was pretty scared.
But yesterday there was an obvious improvement, no fever, the pulse was slower, etc.
Kocher, of course, is a wonderful surgeon, and anyone with thyroid trouble should go to him; he has a huge clien-tele of Russians, of Jews especially.
I am already thinking of the journey back; we expect to leave on August 4 (unless Kocher delays it, which some-times happens) and we shall make overnight stops at Zu-rich, Munich and Vienna, and go on home from there.
I shall be here long enough to receive another letter from you, after which you must write to Poronin.
If I am delayed here I will write again.
The suppression of the paper I wrote for 322 leaves me in a very critical position.
I shall try harder than ever to find publishers and translations; it is very difficult at present to find any literary work.
I embrace you fondly, my dear, and send very best regards to Manyasha and Anya.

You make me ashamed of myself for my silence.
I really am at fault—there has been a lot of bother over our moving and because of the influenza.
Now Y.
V.
here is ill—she has had a very bad attack of influenza but is now recovering.
You ask about new German literature.
I have just fin-ished reading the four volumes of the Marx-Engels cor-respondence.
I want to write about it in Prosveshcheniye.
323 There is much of interest.
It is pity the publishers— those Bosches!—charge such a price for it—40 marks! I have not yet read Beer’s new History of Socialism in England, but I soon shall.
Cunow’s book on the origin of religion appeared recently.
I would send it to you (I can buy it) but I am afraid it would not reach you.
If you receive or can obtain Neue Zeit, there is a list in it of all the interesting things.
I do not see any new bourgeois literature.
If you like I can send you a list of all new books in German (a small publication I get every month, it is put out by Hinrichs, a bookseller in Leipzig).
All the best.
Give Mother many kisses for me and for Nadya.

1 1 Printed from the original245 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S MOTHER December 26 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, It is an age since I last wrote to you.
In general I have been conducting a sort of sit-down strike against letter-writ-ing lately.
Volodya is partly to blame.
He has enticed me into the “excursionist ” party.
It is our local joke that we have a “cinemist” party (of cinema-lovers), an “anti-cine-mist”, or “anti-semitic”, party, and an “excursionist” party, which is always finding excuses for excursions.
Volodya is a confirmed anti-cinemist and an enthusiastic excursionist.
He has recruited me into his party and so I have no time left for anything.
To make things worse, we are having some wonderfully fine days.
With just a light fall of snow— really excellent.
And autumn, too, was fine.
After all, what is there to do in Krakow but go walking.
We have no sophis-ticated amusements of any kind.
We did once go to a concert, a Beethoven quartet, we even clubbed together to buy a season ticket, but for some reason the music made us terribly miserable, although an acquaintance of ours, * an excellent musician, was in ecstasies over it.
We do not want to go to the Polish theatre, the cinema here is quite absurd—all five-act melodramas.
.
.
.
Volodya and I have decided that after the holidays we will begin a study of the local University library, for, to our shame, we have never been there.
If there is anything we thirst for here it is good literature.
Volodya has practically learned Nadson and Nekrasov by heart and an odd volume of Anna Karenina * Inessa Armand.
—Ed.
is being read for the hundredth time.
We left our literature (a tiny fraction of what we had in St.
Petersburg) in Paris and here there isn’t a Russian book to be had anywhere.
At times we read with envy the advertisements of second-hand booksellers offering 28 volumes of Uspensky or 10 volumes of Pushkin, etc.
, etc.
Volodya, as luck would have it, has become a great fiction-lover.
And an out-and-out nationalist.
You cannot get him to look at the pictures by Polish artists at any price but he has picked up, for instance, a catalogue of the Tretyakov Gallery that some acquaintance had thrown away and is always burying himself in it.
We are all well.
Volodya takes a cold shower every day, goes for walks and does not suffer from insomnia.
He con-tinues praising the local swamp.
Mother is often unwell, first a gumboil, then a cough.
.
.
.
She sends her best regards.
I had a letter from Manyasha, but it was in her usual scrawl so I understood nothing of it.
She should write more often.
I embrace her and you most fondly, wish you good health and everything of the best.
Again I kiss you.
Yours, Nadya Yours, V.

Many kisses, my dear, I wish you good health and spi-rits.

We spent the European New Year’s Eve alone with Volodya sitting over plates of curds, and the Russian New Year’s Eve we shall not celebrate at all because Volodya is going away for a month or six weeks to work in a library.
324 I envy him a bit because our place is more like a backwoods village than a town and I miss people quite a lot.
There is simply no one here to bother about and no one to take care of.
We do not seem to be able to make acquaintances among the local inhabitants.
Winter tried hard to get going here, Volodya went skat-ing three times and tempted me to buy skates, but the weather suddenly turned warm, all the ice melted, and today, for instance, there is a real smell of spring in the air.
Yesterday, too, was not at all like winter.
Volodya and I went for a long walk in the country and it was fine.
That, then, is all our news.
I embrace you fondly, Mother sends regards.

What a difference between, your weather and ours here! Here it is already spring-there has been no snow for a long time, it is warm, we do not wear galoshes and the sun is unusually bright for these parts.
We cannot believe that we are in “wet” Krakow.
It is a pity that you and Manyasha have to live in a nasty little town! .

I have been to Paris and not to London and have had quite a good trip.
Paris is a very unsuitable town for a man of modest means to live in, and very tiring.
But there is no better and more lively town to stay in for a short time, just for a visit, for an outing.
It made a good change.

1 1 Printed from the original250 KRUPSKAYA AND LENIN TO LENIN’S MOTHER March 16 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, It is an age since I wrote to you.
For some reason it seems difficult to write this year.
We are very lonely here—there is really only one family in the whole town with whom we are acquainted.
They have an amusing little boy but we do not see eye to eye with the mother.
There is one other family but their company is painful, they are so worn out with poverty, so completely crushed.
Nor do we get many letters.
We live mostly on newspapers.
The weather here is not bad, the grass is showing green and so are the buds on the trees, but the mud on the roads is terrible.
Volodya went for quite a long ride on his bicycle but had a burst tyre.
We intend to go for long outings in the woods.
We go walking a little every day—our house is on the very outskirts of the town and the fields are only five minutes’ walk from us.
We have already arranged for the old cottage in the country and are thinking of moving there on May 1.
The house there is a bit on the big side for us and is a long way from the shops, but the rooms are very good and have stoves in them, there are two verandahs, and it is some distance from the road.
Perhaps I shall recover my breath there.
Again I have thyroid trouble, not as badly as before, my eyes are almost normal and my neck swells only when I am excited, but the palpitation is rather bad.
Actually the disease does not yet bother me very much and does not prevent my doing anything, but it is a bore to have to be careful of everything and to have to start an invalid routine again.
It is damphere in Krakow but in Poronin I shall probably get over it all very quickly.
Volodya is very fond of Poronin and particularly likes scrambling up the mountains.
This time we intend to take a servant who will live in, so that there will be no bother with the housekeeping and we shall be able to go on long outings.
Anya is spoiling us this year by sending so many books.
Has Manyasha received my letter? Many kisses for her and for you, my dear.
Mother sends regards.
She wanted to go to Russia, but it is a lot of trouble.
I wish you all the best and hope you keep well.
Yours, Nadya Many kisses, Mother dearest, and regards to all.
Mitya as well—many thanks for the letter.
I have also had a letter from Mark.
Here we saw the “Beilis affair” 330 in the cin-ema (they made a melodrama of it).

252 TO HIS SISTER MARIA Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, Samarin’s House, Apt.
3, Moskovskaya Street, Vologda, Russia April 22 Dear Manyasha, I have had news that you are annoyed at my prolonged silence.
I am indeed at fault as far as letter-writing is con-cerned—it is very difficult in our situation (in yours and in mine especially) to carry on the correspondence one would like.
.
.
.
Yesterday we received a letter from Mother addressed to me and to Nadya.
Give Mother many kisses for me.
Per-haps you will be better off in summer than in winter.
I recently received information about the exiles at Olo-nets.
They have collected material about the situation there and who the exiles are—most of them are workers, new people (post-revolutionary people), out of 150 people in the uyezd there are two liquidators and a few Left Narod-niks.
Apparently there are great changes in the composi-tion of the exile groups—it would be of interest to collect the data and publish them occasionally in Prosveshche-niye.
332 Nadya has written to you and intends to write again.
In a fortnight or so we are again going to Poronin—there are mountains there and I hope that Nadya’s thyroid trouble will pass—mountain air is good for people sufferingfrom this disease.
The weather here is wonderful and I frequently go cycling.
No matter how provincial and barbarous this town of ours may be, by and large I am better off here than I was in Paris.
The hurly-burly of life in the émigré colony there was incredible, one’s nerves got worn down badly and for no reason at all, Paris is an inconvenient place to work in, the Bibliothèque nationale is badly organised—we often thought of Geneva, where work went better, the library was convenient, and life was less nerve-racking and time-wasting.
Of all the places I have been in my wanderings I would select London or Geneva, if those two places were not so far away.
Geneva is particularly fine for its general cultural level and the conveniences that make life easier.
Here, of course, there can be no talk of culture—it is almost the same as Russia—the library is a bad one and extremely inconvenient, although I scarcely ever have to go there.
.
.
.
Autumn in the Tatras (the mountains near where we live in Poronin) is marvellous—at least, last autumn was delightful after a rainy summer.
Your time will be up in autumn, won’t it? I sometimes have dreams of our seeing one another in autumn.
If it is fine in autumn we are think-ing of staying in the country in October, too.
All the best, Yours, V.

My incarcera-tion was a very brief one, 333 only 12 days, and I was soon granted certain privileges, so that the “time” I did was very easy, the conditions and the treatment were good.

You addressed it to our old apart-ment; our present address is Distelweg, 11.
I will try to find out whether or not there is a bureau here that can give information about Russian prisoners of war, and also about that particular prisoner you are interested in.
339 Perhaps because of the coming holidays I shall not be able to find out immediately, but in any case I will try.
We are living fairly well, quietly and peacefully in sleepy Berne.
The libraries here are good, and I have made quite decent arrangements as far as the use of books is concerned.
It is even pleasant to read after my daily newspaper work.
There is a pedagogical library here for Nadya and she is writing something on pedagogy.
I wrote asking Anyuta whether it is possible to find a publisher for an agrarian book; I could write one here.
If you have an opportunity to do so, would you, too, try to find out?Why didn’t you write anything about yourself—how are you keeping? Are you earning anything? How much, where, and is it enough? Drop me a line if you can.
Very best regards, Yours, V.

If you have an opportunity, please find out (if it is not too much trouble) whether Granat received my article on Marx.

336, Syromyatniki, Moscow, Russia Uljanow, Distelweg, 11, Berne (Switzerland) February 9, 1915 Dear Manyasha, I have received two pamphlets from you—by Oganovsky and Maslov.
Many thanks! They are both rotten opportu-nists of the most harmful type (can there be anybody in agreement with them and with Plekhanov? It could not be worse).
It is, however, extremely useful to know what they are writing.
I shall therefore be extremely grateful if you send me things of this sort and also clippings from news-papers (and magazines) dealing with similar subjects.
A long time ago (in the August or September issues), Y.
Smir-nov, for instance, wrote something extremely shallow in Russkiye Vedomosti about voting for credits, etc.

Today I received a notice from the Central Committee of the German Red Cross Unions to the effect that Aaron Rosenfeldt is a prisoner of war at Bütow, 66 Regiment.
344 It has taken more than a year to get the information; neith-er the Geneva nor the Danish Red Cross could find any-thing out, but I accidentally came across the address of the German prisoner of war commission and wrote to them.
They, too, took more than two months to reply! Nadya and I are very pleased with Zurich; there are good libraries here—we shall stay a few weeks more and then return to Berne.

I yesterday received her letter (postcard) dated August 8, and also some books, for which my best thanks.
I was greatly worried by the news that Anyuta is in hos-pital.
346 What is the matter? Is it the same disease that made her once before, as she wrote, go into hospital for an operation? I hope that she and you will, at least, apply to only the very best surgeons because in such cases one should never have deal-ings with mediocre doctors.
I shall impatiently await more frequent news, even if only in brief.
Letters take a terribly long time nowadays! Many thanks to Manyasha for taking so much trouble over publishers; I shall get down to writing something or other, because prices have risen so hellishly that life has become devilishly difficult.
How is Manyasha getting on? Does she earn a good salary? (I received 200 rubles and acknowledged it; thanks again.
) If you can, please send Russian newspapers once a week after you have read them, because I have none at all (it is not worth while sending them more often).

Thanks very much for the trouble you have taken with the publishers and for the money you sent.
Has the new publisher received the manuscript on modern capitalism? 347 Please let me know when he does.
I regard this work on economics as being of exceptionally great importance and would especially like to see it in print in full.
You write that the publisher wants to put out The Agrarian Question as a book and not as a pamphlet.
I understand that to mean that I must send him the continuation (i.
e.
, in addition to what I have written about America I must write what I have promised about Germany), 348 I will start on this as soon as I have finished what I have to write to cover the advance received from the old publisher.
* And so I take it that the new publisher has commis-sioned me to continue the agrarian question! If you have the chance, remind him of that.
(I have not received the 500 rubles, but shall receive them in a day or two, of course; I do not think it is an advance, but payment for the manu-scripts received.
) Is it at all possible (if an opportunity offers, not especially) to find out whether Granat included my article on Marx * The old publisher was V.

Bonch-Bruyevich.
—Ed.

If he does not answer, can you find out from the library by taking out the volume for that letter? I have sent you three suggestions for translation (three books—Kemmerer; Gilbreth; Hobson).
If they are not suit-able let me know and I will look for others.
If suitable, you must make sure that an order is given and the suggestion accepted.
Then I will start work.
Perhaps Anya will under-take the translation of one of the books? Give Anya my very best regards and Nadya’s.
I have sent you three postcards to M.

Please write and let me know what money this is, whether it is from a publisher, from which one, for what and whether it is for me.
I must keep an account, that is, I must know what the publisher has paid for and what he has not.
I cannot understand where so much money comes from; Nadya says jokingly that I must have been “pensioned off”.
Ha, ha! The joke is a merry one, for the cost of living makes one despair and I have desperately little capacity for work because of my shattered nerves.
But joking aside, I must know more about this; please let me know.
It is most likely that one (or more) of your letters has gone astray and I do not know what is going on.
I am afraid to spend the money (sometimes money was sent through me to a sick friend).

, Nevsky, 45, Petrograd, Russia Wl.
Oulianoff, Spiegelgasse, 14, Zürich I, Switzerland Dear Mark Timofeyevich, From the enclosed you will see that Nadya is planning the publication of a Pedagogical Dictionary or Pedagogical Encyclopaedia.
349 I am strongly in favour of this plan because, in my opin-ion, it fills a very serious gap in Russian pedagogical liter-ature; it will be a very useful work and will provide an income, which for us is extremely important.
With the increase in the number of readers and the broad-er circles involved, there is now a quickly growing demand for encyclopaedias and similar publications.
A properly compiled Pedagogical Dictionary or Pedagogical Encyclo-paedia will become a handbook and go through a number of editions.
I am sure Nadya can do this because she has been working in pedagogy for years, has written about it and has under-gone systematic training.
Zurich is an exceptionally con-venient centre for work of this kind; it has the world’s finest pedagogical museum.
There is no doubt that such an undertaking would be profitable.
The best thing would be for us to undertakethe publication of it ourselves, borrowing the necessary capital or finding a capitalist who would come in as a part-ner in the enterprise.
If that is not possible, and if it would be merely a waste of time to go chasing after it—you, of course, will know what is best, and when you have given it some thought and obtained some information, decide the matter for your-self—the plan should be offered to the old publisher, who will probably accept it.
The plan must not be stolen, i.
e.
, somebody else must not get in first.
Then a detailed contract must be concluded with the publisher in the name of the editor (Nadya) that covers all the terms.
If not, the publish-er (the old publisher too!) will grab all the profit for him-self and enslave the editor.
That happens.
I should very much like you to give this plan your best attention, take a look round, talk with people, worry them, and answer * me in detail.
All the best, Yours, V.
Ulyanov P.

The publication is in two volumes, two columns to a page; to be issued in parts of 16 to 32 pages.

I sent a telegram to Kazan and, as I got no answer, sent another to Nizhny, and from there I today received a reply to the effect that the Krasnaya Zvezda is supposed to arrive in Kazan on July 8 and stay there for not less than 24 hours.
In that telegram I asked whether it would be possible to give Gorky a cabin on Krasnaya Zvezda.
He is arriving here tomorrow and I want very much to drag him out of Petrograd, where he has exhausted his nerves and gone sour.
I hope you and the other comrades will be glad to have Gorky travelling with you.
He is really a very nice chap, a bit capricious, but that is nothing.
I read the letters asking for help that sometimes come for you and try to do what I can.
Mitya has left for Kiev; the Crimea, it seems, is again in the hands of the Whites.
There is nothing new here; on Sundays we take a holiday at “our” country house.

I learned from Molotov that you did have a heart attack; that means that you are overworking yourself.
You must stick strictly to the rules and obey the doctor’s orders absolutely.
Otherwise you will not be able to work when winter comes.
Don’t forget that! I have already wired you about affairs in the People’s Commissariat of Education.
Things are going brilliantly on the Eastern Fronts.
Today I learned of the capture of Yekaterinburg.
In the south there has been a change, but there is still no serious turn for the better.
I hope there will be.
I could not persuade Gorky to go, hard as I tried.
Yesterday and the day before I was in Gorki with Mitya (he has been here for four days) and Anya.
The limes are in bloom.
We had a good rest.
I embrace you fondly and kiss you.
Please rest more and work less.

The files of the Mos-cow Gendarmerie (Dossier of the Moscow Group of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, No.
69, Volume V, 1901, sheet 101)* contain the following entries concerning these letters.
1.
A letter dated July 3, 1897, signed “Yours, V.
U.
” and beginning with the words “I have received your letter of June 16, dear Manyasha”, was found in an envelope addressed to Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (the mother of “Manyasha”).
The letter contains a programme of Marxist studies, and among the source material mentioned are such Social-Democratic periodicals as Vorwärts and Neue Zeit.
2.
A letter dated September 4, 1898, is signed “Yours, V.
U.
” but on the envelope the address of the sender is given as Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova.
In this letter, which begins with the words “A few days ago, Mother dearest, I received your letter”, the following phrases are outstanding: (1) “As for sending books to Sergei Ivanovich, I must say that I do not know where he is.
Perhaps he is already in Sredne-Kolymsk”; (2) “Lyakhovsky wrote a few days ago—mostly about new exiles passing through Verkholensk”; (3) “Vas.
Vas.
(Starkov) is think-ing of asking to be sent to Nizhneudinsk”; (4) “The Lepeshinskys are being moved to Kuraginskoye”; (5) “Apollinariya Alexan-drovna wrote recently from Kazachinskoye”.
3.
A letter signed “V.
U.
”, dated December 15, 1898, begin-ning with the words “I am sending Anyuta Y.
M.

he sent me with a request that I despatch it immediately”, in which the phrase quoted, and the initials “Y.
M.
” in that phrase, are deserving of attention.
4.
A letter dated June 14, 1899, signed “Yours, V.
U.
”, begins with the words “This week there has been no news from home, Mother dearest”; the name of Prince Yegor Yegoro-vich Kugushev is mentioned in the letter; the author of the letter asks for a copy of his book on the development of capital-ism to be sent to the aforementioned Kugushev.
5.
A letter by the same author dated “August 18, 1900, Paris”, addressed to M.
A.
Ulyanova; it contains the address: “M.
Dr.
Dubon, chez.

.
.
Pour M.
Goukowsky, 8 Boulevard Capucines, Paris”.
6.
A letter dated “October 20, Prague”, signed “V.

”, addressed to Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova; it contains the address: “Herrn Franz Modrá0ek (for V.
I.
), Sme0ky, 27.

” Attempts to find these letters have not so far met with any suc-cess; it is possible that they were destroyed in one of the fires that occurred in the early days of the February Revolution.
II LETTERS WRITTEN BY NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA 1898 1 TO LENIN’S MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA February 15, 1898 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Did not Anna Ilyinichna receive the letter I sent on February 8 or 9? I wrote in some detail about myself in that letter.
The trouble is that I still do not know when the sentence will be pronounced; at the Ministry of Justice they told me that the case would be reported on in either the first or the second week of Lent.
They also said that I have been sentenced to three years in Ufa Gubernia (the sentence is not to be changed), but that the Department can, on its own author-ity, permit me to spend the time I am under surveillance in Shu-shenskoye.
The situation is thoroughly vague.
After the sentence has been pronounced I shall probably have to remain in St.
Petersburg a couple of weeks, so we may expect to leave during the third or fourth week of Lent.
We shall stay in Moscow for two or three days and I shall write and let you know the day of arrival as soon as I know it, for certain.
As far as Volodya’s work * is concerned, I have been defi-nitely promised that a publisher will be found; they say that censor-ship conditions in Moscow are very bad and that there is a risk of the book lying at the censor’s for a long time; I have been advised to publish the book in summer, so that it appears in autumn, the most suitable time for the publication of a book of this type.
Because of all this, I did not take the manuscript back but asked Anna Ilyinichna what she thought would be the best thing to do—I have not received an answer.
In the meantime I have sent Volodya a translation from English (the editor says that it does not matter even if Volodya does not know English very well, he can translate from the German version * The work referred to is Lenin’s Economic Studies and Essays.
— Ed.
and use the English only to check with); it is a very interesting trans-lation and the pay is good.
I do not know whether Volodya intended taking translations although I gathered from one of his letters that he did; in any case, there is nothing to worry about because I have been told that we may both translate, the book is a big one.
I am ter-ribly ignorant on the administrative side of literary work.
Mother has been suffering from pleurisy and, has not been out for about a month; today a new doctor is coming to examine her—the one who treated her before was very casual.
Mother sends her very best regards to all.
Still, I think I shall be allowed to go to Shusha—what do they care? Many kisses, Your loving, Nadya February 15 Dear Manyasha, I have written once to Anna Ilyinichna but she evidently has not received my letter.
Bulochka, too, is scolding me for not writing and also without any reason! Of course, there is nothing to write about, nothing is definite, one thing today, another tomorrow, but I do write about essential things and I answer letters.
I have not seen Kuba and probably shall not see her before I leave.
I had a letter from her saying that now she does not have to talk she feels wonderful.
She studies a lot, is very glad about the Thursdays and sends, regards to all.
I shall probably get V.
V.
I have given Volodya’s list to an acquaint-ance, who has promised to get everything except Lyudogovsky (it has long been out of print) and the journal on economics.
I do not know whether he will get them although he is an expert at obtain-ing books.
I want to get in a good stock of books but I do not know what to take.
I have few books of my own and they are very ordinary, so I don’t really know whether it is worth taking them—Volodya probably has them all anyway.
It is not very easy to get books from acquaintances—and what should one get? In a couple of weeks I have to go and my stock of books is still pitifully small.
In general we are being rather slack and quite unmethodical about preparing for the journey.
People say we ought to take as many warm things aspossible.
.
.
.
It probably will not be long now before we start.
Kiss A.
I.
and tell her it is not nice of her to give such accounts of me every-where—to Volodya she wrote about my looking like a herring, to Bulochka she complained of my slyness.
.
.
.
Many kisses for you, dear.
Thank Dmitry Ilyich for his congratulations.
I hope his case is over by the summer.
Au revoir! N.

Petersburg to Moscow First published in 1 9 2 9 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.
4 Printed from the original 2 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA March 6 I am sending Volodya’s articles.
I did not send them before because I was waiting for him to reply to the letter in which I wrote about censorship conditions.
He asked me to make enquiries, and the result of my enquiries is that the place of publication is most impor-tant.
In this respect, Moscow is worse than St.
Petersburg because even the most innocent books are held up for a long time and then hacked about very badly.
Bulgakov’s book was held up for a year by the censor.
It appears that Vodovozova has also transferred her publish-ing house to St.
Petersburg.
The écrivain insists that it would be extremely unwise to publish the book in Moscow.
So that’s that.
About my departure .
.
.
Manya dear, I know nothing at all.
There is a lady from Minusinsk living here who says that I shall not be able to leave after the 10th or 12th without the risk of getting stuck on the way.
I was hoping all along that the sentence would be pronounced on March 4 and we would be able to leave on the evening of the 10th.
The sentence, however, has been postponed until the 11th (not definite either) and this is what they say in the Department: my request will “probably be taken into consideration”, and if I am given permission to go to Siberia, it will not be before the sentence has been pro-nounced, and perhaps I shall be given permission to go straight from St.
Petersburg and not from Ufa Gubernia (!).
I am going to the Department again tomorrow.
I certainly don’t want my journey to be postponed until spring.
I am in a great hurry today but tomorrow eve-ning I will write to Anna Ilyinichna and tell her about my trip to theDepartment.
Tomorrow, while I am there, I shall ask to be allowed to see Kuba—it would be such a pity to go away without having seen her once.
Many kisses, N.

Petersburg to Moscow First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original 3 TO LENIN’S MOTHER Dear Maria Alexandrovna, We have now reached Shushenskoye and I am keeping my promise to write and tell you how Volodya is looking.
It seems to me he is a picture of health and looks very much better than he did in St.
Petersburg.
One of the local inhabitants, a Polish woman, * says, “Pan Ulyanov is always in a good mood”.
He is terribly taken up with the shooting, in fact they are all such enthusiastic sportsmen that I, too, will probably soon be on the constant look-out for duck, teal and other such creatures.
The journey to Shusha is not at all tiring, especially if there is no need to wait in Krasnoyarsk; it is even promised that in June the steamers will go right up to Shusha.
That will make everything just right.
So if you can manage a trip the journey will not be too bad.
It seems to me that Shusha is very nice, the forest and river are near.
I am not writing a lot because this is only a postscript to Volodya’s letter.
** He has probably written in much greater detail.
In Minu-sinsk I went to enquire about the books; a letter from you and a notice about the receipt of a parcel had come, but the addressee cannot get them from Krasnoyarsk; things were set right that same evening and we sent a power of attorney to Krasnoyarsk and the books will be here in a day or two.
Many thanks.

our innumerable bags and baggage, nothing was lost and people made room for us everywhere.
Thanks, too, for the food.
It lasted us for three days and it was much nicer than railway-station meals.
.
.

So here we are.
They did put us ashore after all.
Volodya is not satisfied with what I had to tell him about all of you.
He says it is very little, but I told him all I knew.

Krupskaya Written May 1 0 , 1 8 9 8 Sent from St.
Petersburg to Moscow First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original 4 TO LENIN’S MOTHER June 14 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Volodya is sitting here engaged in an earnest conversation with a miller about some houses and cows and things, so I am taking the opportunity of writing you a few lines.
I do not know where to begin, one day is the same as another and there is nothing happening outside the family.
I seem to have been living an age in Shusha and have become completely acclimatised.
Shusha is a very nice place in sum-mer.
We go walking every evening.
Mother does not go very far, but we sometimes set off for more distant places.
In the evenings there is no humidity in the air and it’s just right for walking.
There are a lot of mosquitoes and we have made nets for ourselves but they seem to go out of their way to bite Volodya, although in general they are quite bearable.
The famous “gun dog” accompanies us on our walks and spends all its time chasing birds, which always makes Volodya indignant.
At this time of the year Volodya does not go shooting (he is not really such an enthusiastic sportsman), it is nesting time or something, and even his waders have been put away in the cellar.
Instead of shooting Volodya tried his hand at fishing.
A few times he crossed the Yenisei to fish for burbot at night but the last time he came back without so much as a tiddler, and since then there has been no more talk of burbot.
Across the Yenisei it is just marvellous.
We once went across there and had heaps of adventures of all kinds and everything was fine.
It is hot nowadays.
We have to walk quitea long way to bathe.
A plan for morning swimming has been elaborat-ed for which we are to get up at 6 a.
m.
I do not know how long this will last, but today we went swimming.
Altogether our life here fol-lows the “standard” summer-cottage routine, only we have nothing for the house.
They feed us well here, we have all the milk we like and we are all flourishing.
I have not yet got used to Volodya’s healthy appear-ance, in St.
Petersburg I was accustomed to seeing him in a perma-nently out-of-sorts condition.
Zinochka even gasped when she saw him in Minusinsk.
And you should see what she looks like—thank God.
With Lirochka it’s a different story.
We were sent a photograph from St.
Petersburg; it was taken the day after she was released and she looks simply terrible.
Can she have changed so much? Sometimes I think they might send her to Shusha.
That would be fine.
In Shusha she might recover a little.
Well, I have given you a whole heap of gossip.
In her last letter Manyasha asked about photographs.
On the way here I wrote to St.
Petersburg and asked them to send you my photograph (home produc-tion) but they must have forgotten.
As regards photographs that are not home-made, I shall write to St.
Petersburg and ask them to go to the photographer’s and order a few more pictures of me, and that they certainly will not refuse to do.
I should very much like you and Manya to come to visit us here.
There is still time for it.
Give D.
I.
my regards.
Volodya has finished talking to the miller and has already written two letters and I still cannot wind up my gossip.
Good-bye for now and many kisses.
Mother sends regards to all.
It is useless sending regards through Volodya, he thinks they should be taken for granted.
Nevertheless I send many kisses to Manya and Anyuta and regards to M.
T.
Yours, N.
Kr.

4 Printed from the original5 TO LENIN’S SISTER ANNA August 9, 1898 It gave Volodya great satisfaction to read out to me all the reproaches that you have written about me.
Well, I admit that I am guilty but deserving of leniency.
Today Volodya finished his “markets”, * now he has only to cut it down and the job is done.
In a few days, too, Webb will come safely to an end.
Less than a half is left to be checked.
I think the translation turned out all right in the end.
Another box of books for Volodya—among them Adam Smith, philosophy and two books of yours by Ada Negri—has arrived addressed to Madame Friedmann.
She looked like raising a real storm but the outcome is that the books have been received, put on the shelves and catalogued.
Volodya from time to time looks lovingly at the phi-losophy and dreams of the time when he will be able to wallow in it.
I received a letter from Lirochka yesterday, such a cheerful one, describing her life at Kazachinskoye.
There are ten exiles there, most of whom live in a commune; they have their own vegetable garden, a cow and a meadow and live in one big house.
Lira says she enjoys her freedom, goes picking berries and haymaking, does some house-keeping and never looks at a book.
She proposes spending the summer in this way and then leaving the commune in autumn and settling down to work.
It was a long and lively letter and I am very glad for her sake, she is at least getting a rest.
Life here goes on as usual and there is no news of any kind.
Volodya has been busy all the time, although occasionally he has been snipe shooting.
They had intended going somewhere after snipe today but the wind has been howling mercilessly for several days, day and night.
There is no rain but just this raging wind.

Volodya is thinking of going into the taiga for a couple of days; he wants to see what the taiga is like, gather berries and cones and shoot hazel grouse.
There has been a lot of talk about the taiga, and it is much more interesting than the talk about ducks.
That, I think, is all there is to tell about us.
When is Manya leaving for Brussels? I am glad for her sake.
I have written a letter to [Anna Ivanovna Meshcheryakova] (the former [Chechurina]), * our schoolteacher and my very good friend.
She will be living in Liege—the only thing I am afraid of is that she has left already and my letter will be too late.

4 Printed from the original 6 TO LENIN’S MOTHER Dear Maria Alexandrovna, A telegram about the release of D.
I.
eventually arrived with the last post.
The post came when our place was full of visitors.
During the past few days we have been subjected to an invasion of “aliens”, some from Minusinsk, some from places round about—people of very different character.
They brought discord into our peaceful life and towards the end we were growing a little bit crazy.
The various “farm” discussions about horses, cows, pigs, etc.
, really wore us out.
Every-one here is interested in farm life—even we acquired half a horse (one of the local residents hired a horse from the volost and we wanted to buy the fodder for it so as to be able to use it as much as we wanted), but our half horse turned out to be such a worn-out nag that it took an hour and a half to drag us three versts and we had to give it back; and so our efforts in this field turned out a fiasco.
We do, however, gather mush-rooms with great zeal, there are lots of saffron milk-cap and milk agaric * The names in square brackets were cut out for secrecy.
—Ed.
mushrooms here.
At first Volodya announced that he did not know how to gather mushrooms and did not like it, but now you cannot drag him out of the forest, he gets real “mushroom fever”.
Next year we intend to have a vegetable garden and Volodya has already agreed to dig the seedbeds.
That will be physical exercise for him.
Up to now he has been enthusiastic only about his shooting.
Right now he is arming himself for the hunt.
He shoots grey-hen and we eat them and praise them.
I do not think our “manor house” will be very cold.
A clerk lived here before us and said it was all right, warm.
In any ease we are taking all the necessary precautions—we have ordered some felt, we are sealing the windows up carefully, are piling up earth round the bottom of the house, etc.
We have a stove in every room, so we do not expect it to be very cold.
Well, that’s enough gossip.
I embrace you fondly, I am awfully glad for D.
I.
’s sake and for yours.
Give him my very best regards.
Many kisses for Anya and Manya.
Mother sends best regards to all.
She is gradually being drawn into Shushenskoye life and is not so bored now as she was at first.
Yours, Nadya Written August 2 6 , 1 8 9 8 Sent from Shushenskoye to Podolsk First published in 1 9 2 9 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.
4 Printed from the original 7 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA September 11, 1895 Today I am going to write an enormously long letter; Volodya has gone off to Krasnoyarsk and the place seems empty without him, the “regime” has changed.
As there is suddenly nothing to do this evening the best thing is to scribble a letter.
I can run on about this and that for any length of time, but that is all it will be—just “this and that”.
Today, dear Manya, I got your long, long letter, and Volodya received a postcard from Tula, I suppose from D.
I.
I have put it in his desk.
I imagine it must be boring for D.
I.
to hang about in Tula and, in general, his present state of uncertainty is not of the pleasantest and in a strange town it is particularly miserable; but the worst isover, that endless “sit-down at Azov”.
* By now D.
I.
may perhaps be in Podolsk .
.
.
in any case the question has probably been settled.
We are having a marvellous autumn, except that in the early morn-ing it is cold and at night there are frosts.
Because of this Volodya has taken all his warm things with him—a warm cap, winter coat, mittens and warm socks.
He put in a request about his teeth a long time ago; now his toothache has gone and permission has come for him to spend a week in Krasnoyarsk.
At first Volodya thought he would not go, but then he yielded to temptation.
I am very glad that he will be making this trip, it will liven him up and he will be seeing people—he was vegetating here in Shusha.
He was also glad to be going.
The day before he left not a single book was opened.
I spent all my time repairing his winter equipment, while he sat on the win-dowsill talking excitedly and giving me all sorts of advice—to have the double windows put in properly, to keep the door well locked (he even borrowed a saw from our landlord and set about sawing a piece off the door to make it fasten more easily.
In general, he has been worrying a lot about our safety—he has persuaded Oscar to come to us to sleep and he has been teaching me how to use a revolver.
He slept badly that night but when I woke him up in the morning—that was when the coachman was already here—he was so cheerful he began singing a song of triumph.
I do not know whether he will be pleased with the trip.
He couldn’t resist taking a mountain of books with him—five of the fattest tomes—and intends to make notes in the Krasnoyarsk library in addition to that.
I hope the books will remain unread.
When in Krasnoyarsk Volodya is under an obligation to buy for himself two caps, linen for his shirts, a sheepskin greatcoat for family use, skates, etc.
I wanted to order him to buy material for a blouse for Prominsky’s daughter but since Volodya went to Mother to find out how many “pounds” of cloth to buy for a blouse he had to be relieved of that onerous duty.
I have received a short note from Volodya sent from Minusinsk; although he grumbles at having to wait for a steamer I gathered that the journey is beginning satis-factorily.
During Volodya’s absence I Intend: (1) to carry out full repairs to his suits; (2) learn to pronounce English, for which I have to learn by heart 12 pages of various exceptions in Nurok’s book; (3) finish * Don and Zaporozhye Cossacks were besieged in the fort of Azov in 1641; they “sat” in the fort for over a year before abandoning it to the Turks.
—Ed.
reading an English book I have started.
And then do some general reading.
Volodya and I began to read The Agitator (“For Nadya” is written on The Agitator in Anya’s hand and I keep intending to thank her for it, but so far have done nothing but intend) and we have been tormented by English pronunciation, so now I have promised him to learn Nurok by heart.
These days I am doing the cooking.
Mother has an awful cold in the head which has developed into a severe chill, so I am running the show.
Mother has become quite used to Shushenskoye and in her letters describes the wonderful Shushen-skoye autumn.
Before Volodya left we all went with him on a shoot for grey-hen.
The season is now open for grey-hen and partridge.
They are noble birds—you don’t have to crawl in swamps for them like you do for ducks and things.
But no matter how many times we went out we never saw either a grey-hen or a partridge, but still the walks were fine.
By the way, we once saw about twenty partridge; we were riding on a cart, all the Shushenskoye colony, when suddenly a whole flock of them rose from both sides of the road; you can imag-ine what our sportsmen were like.
Volodya actually groaned.
Still, he managed to take aim, but the partridge simply walked away without even bothering to fly.
Altogether that was a sorrowful shoot; we didn’t kill anything, though Oscar shot Jenny in the eyes and we thought the dog would be blinded, but she recovered.
Jenny is awfully miserable without Volodya, she keeps close to me all the time and barks for no good reason.
You see what nonsense I am writing because there is nothing happening outside the family.
That is why Volodya writes about one and the same thing in his letters—when things outside are so monoto-nous one completely loses one’s sense of time.
Volodya and I once got to the state when we could not remember whether V.
V.
had visit-ed us three days or ten days before.
We had to adduce a whole series of arguments to settle the issue.
We only just managed it.
Volodya intended writing home from Minusinsk, so some parts of my letter will probably be repeated.
Perhaps not, though.
Mine is a purely feminine letter, not much in it.
I recently received a letter from the writer’s wife, who writes that she is reading the proofs of Volodya’s book,* she had the seventh signature at the time.
She was afraid there would not be ten signatures in the book—there is a new law about the * N.
A.
Struve read the first part of the proofs of the symposium Economic Studies and Essays.
—Ed.
number of letters to a signature.
If not, Karyshev * can be shoved in, too; it would be a good idea, except that the book will be held up.
We are expecting it any day.
Volodya hopes to finish the “markets” by the New Year, but he is rather doubtful about it.
And that’s that.
I have received Maria Alexandrovna’s letter of August 10 and for some reason was particularly glad to have it.
Many kisses for her.
By the time you receive my letter you will probably be getting ready to leave.
I wish you every success.
There was a time when I very much wanted to go to Belgium.
Perhaps I shall feel like going abroad again, just to take a look at the wide world—when that is possible.
But for the time being it is not to be thought of.
I suppose you will wait for Anya, won’t you? When did she expect to get back? [Meshcheryakova] ** is a very fine person, a bit wild, but amazingly forthright and good.
It is time to stop.
Again, many kisses for you and Maria Alexandrovna from me and Mother.

5 Printed from the original 8 TO LENIN’S MOTHER September 27 Today I am again writing instead of Volodya, dear Maria Alexan-drovna.
Volodya returned from Krasnoyarsk late in the evening the day before yesterday; two of Manya’s letters were awaiting him and he intended to sit down and write a letter home, but first thing in the morning Oscar and Prominsky came to entice him away shooting at a place called Aganitov Island where, according to them, hares run around in thousands and flocks of grey-hen and partridge fill the air.
Volodya began by hesitating but in the end yielded to temptation; by the way, it is a wonderful day today.
In general this autumn has * Lenin’s article was entitled “On the Question of our Factory Statistics (Professor Karyshev’s New Statistical Exploits)”, Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.

** The name was cut out for purposes of secrecy.
—Ed.
been a good one except for a week or so when it was cold.
Alto-gether, Volodya was pleased with his trip to Krasnoyarsk.
He has probably written that he went to Krasnoyarsk with Elvira Ernestovna and Tonechka because E.
E.
had injured her liver and was quite ill.
* We thought she had cancer or an abscess of the liver but fortunately it was neither, only a blow.
And all she has to do is look after herself.
They came back with Volodya.
E.
E.
was in hospital in Krasnoyarsk and Volodya lived at Krasikov’s.
He saw lots of people in Krasnoyarsk, had plenty of talks and played about ten games of chess.
One of the people now living temporarily in Krasnoyarsk is very likely to be sent to the village of Yermakovskoye, about 40 versts from us.
He is a chess player and a very interesting conversationalist—Volodya made his acquaintance in Krasnoyarsk.
I should very much like him to be sent there.
We could visit each other, 40 versts is no great distance.
Volodya travelled as far as Minusinsk (the steamer took five days to crawl there) with Lepeshinskaya, the wife of an exile who lives in Kazachinskoye.
She has been given a job as nurse in the village of Karaginskoye, also not far from here, and her husband is joining her.
He is a chess player, too.
Lepeshinskaya told Volodya that Liroch-ka is in a state of nerves and irritable, lives in the commune and does the cooking every other week.
They have three women there, one of them bakes bread and the others take turns at cooking.
The day before yesterday I had a letter from Lirochka and she seems to be thoroughly fed up with the life of the colony; she writes that she is glad when she is alone and can do something.
It turned out that the tooth of Volodya’s that ached was not the one he had been trying to pull out but another, and this the Krasnoyarsk dentist duly pulled.
Volodya found the way back home deadly boring although he had mustered quite a pile of books in addition to the masses he took from home.
He did not want to stop in Minusinsk and did not even hand his travel permit in to the chief of police.
In Krasnoyarsk he bought a long sheepskin coat.
It is intended actually for me but in reality it will be a family coat for travelling and distant excursions.
It cost twenty rubles and is so delightfully soft that once you are inside it you don’t want to get out of it again.
In general he bought everything he was supposed to, even toys for Prominsky’s children and for Minya, the son of the felt-boot maker who lives next door.
The lad is about five years old and often trots in to see us.
The morning he heard that Volodya was back, he snatched hold of his mother’s boots and began * See Lenin’s Letter No.

—Ed.
pulling them on.
“Where are you off to?” “Don’t you know Vladimir Ilyich has come back?” “You’ll get in his way, don’t go.
.
.
, ” “Oh no, Vladimir Ilyich likes me!” (Volodya really is fond of him.
) Yes-terday, when we gave him the horse Volodya had brought from Kras-noyarsk for him, he was so taken with Volodya that he would not even go home to sleep but lay down on the mat with Jenny.
An amus-ing lad! At last we have engaged a servant, a fifteen-year-old girl, for two and a half rubles a month&boots; she is coming on Tuesday and that will be the end of our independent housekeeping.
We have got in supplies of everything we can for winter.
We still have to put the double win-dows in, although it is a pity to seal ourselves in when it is so fine outside! Mother is gradually being drawn into Shushenskoye affairs, she keeps well and is not bored.
Thank Manyasha for the letter; of course I shall write to her abroad, too.
I wonder how she will get fixed up there.
It is a pity it is inconvenient for her to travel with the Meshcheryakovs, they are excellent people, Anna especially.
We have received the German Zola and are going to start reading it.
We shall now be receiving Frankfurter Zeitung.
It will be sent from St.
Peters-burg and Volodya intends subscribing to some English newspaper.
Why is there not a sound about Volodya’s book? It will be a pity if it doesn’t come out.
The review of Karyshev’s book should be sent to St.
Petersburg, perhaps there are not ten printer’s signatures and that is the reason for the delay.
Well, that’s enough gossip.
Many, many kisses for you and Manyasha from me and Volodya.
Mother sends best regards.
When is Anya arriving? Yours, Nadya Last time I forgot to write that we have received Bios.
Does it have to be sent on? It is strange that no letter from Volodya came with the Karyshev review.
I remember that he wrote a letter at the time.

Printed from the original9 TO LENIN’S MOTHER October 14 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Immediately Volodya had left for Krasnoyarsk I wrote you a detailed letter and did the same on his return from there.
You have probably received both those letters.
Well all that is a matter of the past.
It is winter here now, our River Shush is frozen hard, we have had some snow but it has disappeared.
It is quite cold (five below), which has not prevented Volodya going off to the island all day to shoot hares, although so far this year he has not yet managed to dispose of a single hare.
He is warmly dressed and it will not do him any harm to get a breath of fresh air; he has recently been buried in his “mar-kets” up to the ears, writing from dawn to dusk.
The first chapter is ready now and it seemed very interesting to me.
I play at being the “un-understanding reader” and am supposed to judge whether the exposition of the “markets” is sufficiently clear; I try to be as “un-understanding” as possible, but there is not much I can find fault with.
It is awfully strange that we have not yet heard a word from the écrivain about the book, we think it has fallen through.
Lately the post has been pretty miserable.
Yesterday we had a good laugh; there was nothing in the post except newspapers, and Mother began to accuse the postman of mischievously hiding letters, our friends of being utterly selfish, us of giving him too few tips; and then she said we grudged money for the postman but otherwise wasted it.
Why did we go to see Kurnatovsky the day before yesterday? We only interrupted his work and ate his dinner.
In the end we all started laughing and got rid of the unpleasant feeling we always get when there is not much in the post.
We did once go to see Kurnatovsky,* who works at a sugar refinery about twenty versts from here.
It was on a Sunday and, although it was cold, the sun was shining in a clear blue sky and away we went.
We were dressed in all our winter things, Volodya was in his winter coat and felt boots and they wrapped me in the “family” sheepskin, so that I was covered from head to foot.
Kurnatovsky proved to be terribly busy, has no holidays and works 12 hours a day.
We really did take him away from his work (but that was good for him) and we really did eat his dinner, too.
We looked * They made the journey on October 11, 1898.
—Ed.
over the sugar refinery, the director was unusually attentive to the “important foreigners” (although Volodya in his felt boots and quil-ted trousers looked like the giant from Hop-o’-My-Thumb and the wind had made my hair stand on end); he tried to justify the rotten condi-tions in which the workers have to work, turned the talk to that sub-ject himself and extended his kindness so far that, despite his elegant and prosperous appearance, he rushed to give Volodya a stool to sit on and himself brushed the dust from it.
I almost burst out laughing.
In a month’s time Kurnatovsky is coming to us on a visit and perhaps Bazil and Tonechka will also manage to call in some day.
I do not know whether Volodya told you that Bazil and Gleb are asking to be transferred to Nizhne-Udinsk, where they have been offered jobs as engineers.
We now use the Minusinsk library through the people in Tesinskoye, although the library is a very poor one.
Anyway, we have enough books.
Anyuta once asked me what I am doing.
I am busy on a popular booklet that I want to write, but still do not know how it will turn out.
* That, so to say, is my chief occupation and in addi-tion I do whatever else comes along—study English, read, write letters, take an interest in Volodya’s work, go for walks, stitch on buttons.
.
.
.
We are now living like real householders; we have piled stable manure round the bottom of the walls outside our house, put in the double windows, made a wonderful little window that opens to air the rooms, planted a garden beside the house and put a fence round it.
We have hired a girl who helps Mother with the housework and does all the dirty work.
Thank you, dear Maria Alexandrovna, for your offer to send us underwear and household utensils.
We do not need any clothes, before we left for Shushenskoye we overhauled our things very thoroughly and as far as household utensils are concerned, we brought some things with us from St.
Petersburg and all we need are such kitchen utensils as beaters, tongs, fire irons and similar items.
Volodya also has everything he needs; at one time he had no nightshirts but he bought some material in Krasnoyarsk and now they are ready, but for I don’t know how many days he has been unable to find time to try them on.
Volodya is always wondering where I get sufficient material for long letters; in his letters he writes only about things of general human interest, while I write about all the little things.
.
.
.
I am still in debt to Anyuta, I have not answered a letter of hers, but tell her not to grumble and not to count letters.
* This appears to refer to Krupskaya’s Zhenshchina-Rabotnitsa (The Working Woman), a book she wrote while in Shushenskoye.
—Ed.
How are you all? Has Manya left? Was she very excited at leaving? Did she go alone or with the Meshcheryakovs? How has D.
I.
’s affair turned out? Has he received permission to live in Podolsk? Are Anyuta and M.
T.
pleased with their journey? But I could keep on asking questions till tomorrow.

Volodya can write himself.
Again many kisses.

5 Printed from the original 10 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA November 11, 1898 We are today still feeling the excitement caused by yesterday’s post.
Yesterday we saw a boy from the volost centre climbing over our fence with a huge bundle.
It proved to be our post, which was of such dimensions that it had to be brought from town wrapped in a sheepskin coat to make sure it was all delivered intact.
It was not letters, of course, only books, but sometimes it is surprisingly pleas-ant to receive books.
How are you keeping? Have you made many friends and, in general, do you still like Brussels? I used to receive enthusiastic letters from Meshcheryakov, who was greatly attracted by life in Belgium.
Sometimes when I read a letter of his I longed to see how people lived out in the wide world.
By the way, you prob-ably get quite a lot of pleasure out of various folk choruses.
They say the singing in Belgium is very fine.
Gleb paid us a visit and one evening he and Volodya sang a little.
I thought about you and thought how you would be listening to the Belgians.
Gleb stayed four days with us.
He came without Zina because Elvira Erne-stovna was ill and could not be left.
They went shooting but Gleb spent most of the time reading the first two chapters of the “markets”.
You think the “markets” are finished, do you? Nothing of the sort.
The book will not be finished until February.
Volodya writes all the time from dawn to dusk and has practically no time left for anything else.
Many kisses from me and from Mother.

I.
It is quite a while since I wrote “home”, as I put it.
Today, as usual, I an going to chatter about this and that, only I don’t know where to begin, I have forgotten what I wrote last time.
The most outstanding event in our life recently was, of course, the arrival of Studies and Essays.
We waited and waited and then gave it up; the day before the post came Volodya asked pessimistically what in particular we could hope for in the post.
Then one grey morning we saw a boy from the volost centre clambering over our fence with a huge bundle of something; it turned out to be tremendous numbers of the Studies wrapped in the volost sheepskin.
.
.
.
Our mood soon changed.
In his joy Volodya almost agreed to go to a wedding at the Matovs’ (local Jewish shopkeepers for whom Volodya has a special antipathy because of their importunate ways).
.
.
.
But that was all a long time ago.
Volodya has now buried himself resolutely and irrevocably in his “markets”, grudges time for anything else, we have not been to the Prominskys for several months, he asks me to wake him at 8 o’clock in the morning, or at half past seven, but my efforts are usu-ally fruitless, he gives a couple of grunts, pulls the clothes over his head and goes to sleep again.
Last night he argued in his sleep about some Mr.
N.
—on and natural economy.
.
.
.
The other thing that keeps him busy, apart from the “markets”, is the skating rink.
On the ini-tiative of Volodya and Oscar a skating rink has been cleared on the river near our house; the schoolmaster and some other locals helped.
Volodya skates beautifully and even keeps his hands in the pockets of his grey jacket like a thorough-going sportsman.
Oscar skates badly and very carelessly, and so he is always falling.
I cannot skate at all; they have fixed up a chair around which I do my best (by the way I have only been out twice and have achieved some success) and the schoolmaster is still waiting for his skates to come.
We are a free spectacle for the local public; they are amazed at Volodya and amused at Oscar and me, and, all the time they keep ruthlessly cracking nuts and throwing the shells on our precious rink.
Jenny thoroughly disap-proves of the rink, she prefers running about the farmyard, burrowing in the snow with her nose and bringing Volodya all sorts of curiosi-ties, like old horseshoes.
Mother is afraid of the skating rink.
There was one very fine day when we dragged her out for a walk; the ice on the river was wonderful, so transparent.
We walked on the ice and Mother slipped and gave her head such a bang that it bled.
Since then she has been more afraid of the ice than ever.
Mother is displeased with Volodya; recently he mistook grey-hen for goose, ate it and praised it—a fine goose, not too fat.
Oh yes, there is one other amusement.
We intend going to the town at Christmas and Volodya is making some chessmen to be ready for the time when he will engage in a life and death struggle with Lepeshinsky.
Volodya is carving the chess-men from bark, usually in the evenings when he has “written himself to a standstill”.
Sometimes he asks my advice—what sort of head to give the king or what should the queen’s waist be like.
I have only the very faintest conception of chess, I mix the knight with the bishop, but I give my advice boldly and the chessmen are turning out splen-did.
However, I have begun to write all sorts of nonsense.
Many kisses for you and Maria Alexandrovna and my best regards to the male part of the family.
Mother sends best regards to all.
Today the sun is shining so brightly in a beautiful blue sky, it will be excellent on the skating rink.
However, good-bye for now.

5 Printed from the original1899 12 TO LENIN’S MOTHER January 10, 1899 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Many thanks for the letter and the parcel.
We have not received it yet because we have a new postman and the registered mail has been held up.
The postman tried to be stand-offish and did not want to take power of attorney to receive correspondence, but now every-thing has been arranged.
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves during the holidays in Minusinsk and had a break that will last us for a long time.
At Christmas almost the whole district was in town, so we saw the New Year in very pleasantly at a big party.
When the company broke up everyone was saying “A wonderful New Year’s party!” The main thing was the splendid mood.
We mulled some wine; when it was ready we put the hands of the clock at “12” and saw the old year out in proper style, everybody sang whatever he could and some fine toasts were pronounced—we drank “To Mothers”, “To Absent Friends”, and so on, and in the end danced to a guitar.
One of the comrades draws well and he has promised to draw some of the out-standing scenes of the New Year’s party.
If he keeps his promise you will get a very good idea of our New Year’s eve.
Altogether it was a real holiday.
Volodya battled on the chessboard from morning till evening and .
.
.
won all the games, of course; then we went skating (a pair of Mercury skates was sent to Volodya as a gift from Krasno-yarsk and on these you can cut figures and do all sorts of tricks.
I, too, have some new skates, but I skate as badly on the new ones as on the old, or rather I do not skate but strut like a chicken, the art is a little too much for me!), sang in chorus and even went driving in a troika.
We wore out our hosts completely! They admitted that another day of it and they would have taken to their beds.
E.
E.
looks much better than she did in St.
Petersburg despite her illness (she cannot eat meat or bread at all).
She is very pleased with the way their family has taken shape and is afraid only of returning to Russia.
There is nothing to be said in praise of the others.
Tonechka looks particularly bad—she suffers from anaemia and eczema.
Even Zina has grown thin and nervous.
They all gasped and expressed astonishment at our healthy rustic appearance, and E.
E.
even declared that I am fat-ter than Zinochka.
Mother did not go away with us for the holidaysand was pretty miserable.
They have all announced their intention of coming to us in Shushenskoye for Shrovetide.
All of us, the Shu-shenskoye public, including Oscar and Prominsky, dream of the arrival of the visitors and have already decided who will stay with whom, what treat we can best arrange for them, etc.
However, it is still a long time to Shrovetide and we have returned to our normal occupations and have cleared the skating rink; Volo-dya is hurrying with his “markets”.
I have received Anya’s letter of December 24 but shall not write a separate letter to her because I would only have to write the same things; there is one little note for her.
She is indignant that I give my letters to Volodya to “edit”, but in most cases I describe our Shushenskoye life in humorous terms and Volodya comes in for a lot of badinage in them; I would not write such letters if I did not give them to him to read before I send them off.
One of the letters I received from the écrivain’s wife * informed me that two of her letters to us had gone astray.
A pity! About my photograph.
Last spring I asked for a family photograph that you liked to be sent to you.
Apparently my request was not fulfilled.
I am now going to write for my latest pictures to be ordered and sent to Podolsk.
I do not know if I should have recognised D.
I.
if I had met him in the street, in some other, more suitable circumstances.
Perhaps I should.
By the way, Vasily Vasilyevich has started reading Blos and has taken it to the factory and asked us to leave it with him for a while, and Zinaida Pavlovna was going to write to her sister in Tula and ask her to send her Blos to Podolsk.
That’s that.
I must stop.
I embrace you and Anya fondly and send regards to all.
So does Mother.

13 TO LENIN’S MOTHER Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Many thanks for the parcel, the only thing is that you are spoiling us too much.
On the whole I must admit I have a very sweet tooth and in self-defence I say that my “organism requires it” (I have to say something).
By the way, I am now converting Volodya to my faith.
I feed him sweets regularly, every day after dinner and after supper, and every time he says it’s “outrageous”, but eats them and enjoys them.
Although we do have enough consuming capacity, we intend leaving some of the sweets for Shrovetide, when we shall be having guests and shall provide the feast of feasts.
Here I must stop.
I embrace you fondly.
Kisses for Anya and regards to all.

.
.
not a word.
If the truth be told, you ought to be scolding me.
I intended writing long ago, but kept on putting It off.
First of all, let me tell you how we spent Christmas.
We had a wonderful time.
All the people from the district came into town, most of them for three or four days.
There are very few of us in Shu-shenskoye and it was very pleasant to be among people.
We now know everybody in the district.
We had a real festive time—went skating.
I was laughed at, but since Minusinsk I have made progress.
Volodya learned a lot of figures in Minusinsk and he now amazes the Shushenskoye public with his “giant steps” and “Spanish leaps”.
Another amusement was chess.
People played literally from morning to night.
Only Zina and I did not play.
But even I caught the infection and played once against a poor player and checkmated him.
Then wesang, in Polish and Russian.
V.
V.
has a guitar and so we sang to gui-tar accompaniment.
We also did some reciting and talked to our heart’s content.
Best of all was our New Year’s party (Volodya, incidentally, was tossed, it was the first time I had seen that perform-ance and I had a good laugh).
We are expecting visitors here at Shrovetide.
I do not know whether they will come, but I hope they do.
I cannot say that the Minusinsk people look well; Tonechka has awful anaemia and she is terribly thin and pale.
Zina has also grown thinner but the worst thing is that she has become extremely nervous; the male side is also weak.
Gleb kept lying down, first on the sofa, then on the bed.
On top of everything, we wore our hosts out completely.
Towards the end of the holidays they were having 10 to 16 people to dinner every day.
They themselves admitted that if they had had another day of it they would have collapsed.
Mother did not go with us, she was afraid of the cold.
After Minusinsk we returned to our usual occupations.
Volodya got down to his “markets”.
He is now writing the last chapter and the book will be ready by February.
I got a letter from the écrivain’s wife in the last post.
The letter was a jubilant one.
The new journal Nachalo has been sanctioned, permission for it came quite unexpect-edly and the fuss and bother going on there now is something terrible.
The letter makes you feel how excited the people there are.
She writes, by the way, that the Webb translation is very good, and that it will soon be out.
Nice to know.
We are having a marvellous steady win-ter.
So far there has not been a suggestion of the terrible Siberian frosts, the sun shines as if it were spring and we are already talking about how the winter passed without our noticing it (although it has by no means passed).
How are you getting on there? It seems that you count the letters you get and don’t write very often yourself.
That’s not the way.
Do you see much of Belgian life? In general, do you like what you have seen of it? But do write more often and I will try to be more punctual.
Mother sends her kisses.
When will you be going home? You have probably become a real Frenchwoman.
I am jealous in advance of your knowledge of the language, how I would like to know even one foreign language thoroughly.
Good-bye and all the best.
Nadya Written January 2 4 , 1 8 9 9 Sent from Shushenskoye to Podolsk First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original15 TO LENIN’S MOTHER April 4 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, A couple of weeks ago I wrote to you and, as usual, filled up the letter with all sorts of nonsense.
Nothing has changed here, we are all well, and it is warm outside—the temperature reaches 17° and there are dry patches in the fields; we take long walks and we have seen two wild geese and a drake.
Volodya has bought himself new waders for shooting excursions, almost to the waist, reads outside in the garden, and goes about in a summer coat, and I recently dug a little ditch wearing no coat at all; I am now thinking seriously of vegetable and flower gardening and pondering deeply over a booklet on the subject sent me by Gleb.
As far as my health is concerned I am quite well but as far as concerns the arrival of a little bird—there the situation is, unfortunately, bad; somehow no little bird wants to come.
You ask me whether our quarters are big.
The apartment is a big one and, if you come—which we would very, very much like—there will be plenty of room for everybody.
I remember that I once sent you a plan of the apartment—I am not sure, though, perhaps I only intended sending it.
It consists of three rooms, one with four windows, one with three and the other with one.
It is true the apartment has one disadvantage—the rooms are all adjoining, but since we are all of one family that does not worry us much.
Vo-lodya and I are thinking of giving you the room we now live in (the one with three windows) and we will move into the middle one; our present room has the advantage that no one has to go through it to get to another room.
However, we shall see.
The main thing is that you should be well enough to travel here, my dear; we shall always be able to find room for you.
If you come in May, the journey on the steamer will be a good one.
We came on the first boat when the countryside was bare, but even then it was beautiful; I think it should be a pleasant journey in summer.
The railway journey, however, is very tiring.
I believe Volodya has written that the people in Minu-sinsk have changed their minds about spending the summer in Shu-shenskoye and have rented a cottage near the town, the only one in the district.
Do you like bathing? Our bathing place is some distance away—about 20 minutes’ walk.
I know Anya likes to bathe.
I remember I once came to visit you at Beloostrov and Anya and I went bathing in the rain.
We have received Nachalo from town and Volodya is highly indignant over Bulgakov’s article and is already thinking out a reply to it.
We had to wait quite a long time for that Nachalo.
At first I thought the postman had lost the post.
He is an awful muddler, that postman of ours—loses a newspaper, forgets to hand over a receipt or takes letters to the wrong address.
I am always cursing him under my breath with all the Siberian swearwords.
But enough of that.
This letter will probably arrive just in time for Easter.
Although Volodya objects, I intend to colour some eggs and make an Easter cake from curds.
Do you know that it is the custom here at Easter to decorate the room with spruce boughs? It is a very pretty custom and we intend to “keep” it (I nearly wrote “keep it up”, but then remembered that next Easter we shall be in Russia again).
Mikh.
Al.
and Kurnatovsky may visit us.
Good-bye.
Many kisses for you and Anya.
Regards to all, from Mother as well.
Yours, Nadya Written April 4 , 1 8 9 9 Sent from Shushenskoye to Podolsk First published in the Fourth Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original 16 TO LENIN’S MOTHER June 20 It is ages since I wrote to you, dear Maria Alexandrovna.
Some-how I could not get down to writing, especially as I thought you might still be coming here.
Now I don’t want to put off my letter-writing any longer.
We are all the same as ever.
Volodya is busy reading all kinds of philosophy (that is now his official occupation)—Hol-bach, Helvétius, etc.
My joke is that it will soon be dangerous to talk to him because he has soaked up so much philosophy.
There is no shoot-ing for the time being and the famous gun is scarcely ever taken out of its cover.
We go for our daily walk and swim regularly, we pick sorrel, berries, etc.
, and Volodya gathers everything with the enthusiasm of a hunter; I was surprised one day to see him tearing up sorrel with both hands.
.
.
.
There has been a lot of talk about shoot-ing expeditions; the places they intend to go to—some place calledForty Lakes, where there is so much game they will need a cart to bring it home, and so on.
All that will be after St.
Peter’s Day, * and we intend going to Minusinsk at that time, probably on the steamer; we have already received permission.
We had visitors recently; first there was Anatoly and his wife, and then Lepeshinsky and his wife and three-months-old daughter.
Anatoly looks very bad, he is not likely to get better and his wife is completely broken, such a quiet little thing.
Even the favourable climate here can no longer help Anatoly.
The Lepeshinskys filled our apartment with hubbub—the baby’s cries, lullabies, etc.
—the two days they were here.
They have a fine little girl, but the two parents are so fond of her they don’t give her a moment’s rest—they sing, dance and pester her all the time.
No new people have been sent here and since summer began Oscar and Prominsky have been putting in an appearance less often, both of them are busy in the vegetable garden.
Mother and 1 have planted a lot of things (even melon and tomatoes) and we have been eating our own radishes, lettuce and dill for a long time.
The flower garden is also in bloom, there are blossoms on the mignonette, and the others (stocks, sweet peas, daisies, pansies and phlox) will be blooming in the more or less distant future; the garden gives Mother pleasure, too.
The girl who worked for us last winter is staying on this sum-mer, so the housekeeping is no bother.
Since only seven months remain before we leave, the talk often turns to the subject of Russia and Volodya intended writing to you about our plans in that direction.
How are you keeping? Have you got rid of your fever, and Anyuta of her cough? I have not answered Anyuta’s letter but she should not be angry as I had intended having a good chat with her when we met.
It is a great pity you are not coming here, but it is not long before we return to Russia and if we get away from here at the proper time we shall be home in Russia by February.
Then you will see how Volodya’s health has improved in Shushenskoye; you cannot compare him with what he was in St.
Petersburg.
I embrace you fondly, my dear—keep well.
Many kisses for Anyuta and Manyasha, regards to M.

Printed from the original17 TO LENIN’S MOTHER July 3 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Yesterday I received your letter of June 10.
We are getting our letters written today because we had intended to go visiting, but it is doubtful whether we shall make the trip since some “weather” is beginning.
Volodya must have praised it too much—he kept say-ing “lovely, lovely weather” and now it has changed till it is like nothing on earth.
There is wind every day that makes the shutters rattle.
But it isn’t cold and we take a daily walk as we did before.
Although the shooting season has begun, Volodya has not yet got “hunting fever”.
He has been shooting only a couple of times.
He shot some grey-hen and we made some good meals off them.
We keep intending to go visiting, we have permission to go to town, but the permit is lying at the volost centre and we don’t know whether we shall go or not.
We were all ready to go when we learned that Vasily Vasilyevich was at the factory and on his way back would call for us to go with him—and we have invited Gleb and Zina to come at that time.
.
.
.
I want to see Zina and have a chat with her, it is a long time since I last saw her.
The only thing is that after all those meetings with comrades one feels somehow dissatisfied.
You intend to say every-thing there is to say but when you meet the talk somehow gets pushed into the background by all sorts of excursions, chess playing, skating, etc.
The result is more like fatigue than pleasure.
However that may be, it is good to see people.
We have heard from Yermakov-skoye that Anatoly is very bad, Lepeshinsky’s wife is a nurse and she thinks the end is not far off.
The doctor at Yermakovskoye is a great optimist and assures Dominika that there is still hope.
About Mikh.
Al.
—he is all alone because his fiancée * has postponed her arrival until the end of summer.
Yermakovskoye is now the most populated place in our district.
I have been wondering all the time whether they will send anybody else to Shushenskoye, but they have not done so.
Prominsky’s time will be up in the autumn and the main question for them now is whether they will go home at the cost of the govern-ment; it is a big family, eight of them, and they will never manage it on their own resources.
In the time we have been here we have got quite used to our Shushenskoye comrades and if for any reason a day * O.
A.
Papperek.
—Ed.
passes without Oscar or Prominsky coming we feel that there is some-thing missing.
.
.
.
Why is Lirochka so bored? She wrote to us that she has so much work she has to get up at 5 or 6 in the morning to get everything done.
It is true that all her work is the sort that gives her little satisfaction, but that is something she cannot change.
Kazachinskoye is no worse than any other place.
I should very much like to see her but now I am hardly likely to.
If she is transferred to our district, it will be when we are no longer here.
Well, good-bye.
Many kisses.
Mother sends very best regards.
Has Anyuta left yet? If not, kiss her for me, and kiss Manya, too, many, many times.
Yours, N.
Ulyanova Written July 3 , 1 8 9 9 Sent from Shushenskoye to Podolsk First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original 18 TO LENIN’S MOTHER Dear Maria Alexandrovna, It is quite a long time since I wrote to you and I have not even answered Manyasha’s letter of September 14 and my conscience is troubling me on account of it.
There is nothing new to write about and I have described our daily life many times.
A few days ago Kur-natovsky visited us and he told us about the people at Yermakov-skoye.
A son has been born to Dominika but the child is ill, they think it is consumptive, and she herself is sick all the time and very miser-able.
Mikh.
Al.
has been found fit for service in the army and he is now enjoying his last few months of freedom.
In December he will be sent nobody knows where but for the time being he is very busy.
His wife is always rather poorly, she is miserable and amuses herself by taking walks in the vegetable garden with a calf and her dog, Kurtashka.
They promised to come to us as soon as the sleigh road is open.
On the two days Kurnatovsky was with us, the men all went out shooting first thing in the morning; Kurnatovsky is fanatically keen on this sport.
Somebody has heard from Kazachinskoye that Yaku-bova has disappeared from there, enquiries are being made about her everywhere, and the people at Yermakovskoye have been asked whether she has been there; according to their information she was there a week ago.
There are rumours that she has escaped abroad, somebody has seen her in Berlin.
So that’s that.
It is already autumn here and soon we shall go skating.
That will be better because we have got rather fed up with walking and Volodya’s shooting will soon be over.
He is now busy with the Webbs’ book.
He has to work on alone because two of us together take longer.
It is boring enough work because the translation is a poor one and it has to be almost all retranslated.
Actually I don’t do anything and I don’t know where all the time goes.
There remain three months and 13 days to the day of our departure, that is very little.
I have already applied to the police department for permission to go to Pskov.
Mother intends to make the same application in her own name.
Well, good-bye.
Many kisses, regards to all.

8 -9 Printed from the original 1900 19 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA March 28 There have not been any letters from you or Anyuta for a long time.
It looks as if my last “collective” letter was not to your liking.
Somehow I could not write at that time.
The Siberians recently gave me a good trouncing for a “collective” letter.
Volodya came in for a good dose, too; he wrote a letter of twenty lines for five persons and expected to get five letters in answer to it They made merciless fun of him.
So that was that.
Congratulations, dear Marusya, and here’s wishing you all the best.
Since I have written all the gossipabout myself in a letter to Maria Alexandrovna, * I am going to write about mutual acquaintances.
Yegor came to see us.
I was awfully glad to see him because I had not known what to think about him.
He looks radiant and very much alive.
He kept talking the whole time without a stop.
He told us that Vasily Vasilyevich had got a good job in Omsk, that Tonya had given birth to a girl and that both were doing well, E.
E.
is in ecstasies over her granddaughter (she was quite indifferent to the first).
Gleb has also got a good job, assist-ant manager of a railway depot near Tomsk.
So far, Zina is still in Nizhneudinsk.
And so everything is all right with them.
But poor M.
A.
is having a bad time in Riga.
He wrote that the barracks were worse than a prison; he is not allowed out alone, always in the company of a soldier, and then only as far as the shop.
They took away all his books except the German dictionary and Civil Law.
The food is bad and he cannot take any into the barracks, it would be stolen immediately.
The clothing they gave him is so bad he had to get some of his own.
The worst thing of all is that M.
A.
has been posted to the very company that dealt brutally with the workers; the soldiers received an award of 10 rubles each for killing a worker, and when they were on patrol they opened fire on their own Initiative.
So you see! The comrades in Minusinsk are all keeping well.
I recently received a letter from them which made me very glad.
Altogether, I never imagined that I had become so fond of the Minusinsk crowd.
Baram-zin, the man we left our dog with, intends to bring us (really to Volo-dya) a drawing of her, he draws very well.
Our dog seems to be having a good time and has become a general favourite.
Talking of the dog reminds me of Lirochka.
She once passed on some instructions through me, and one of them concerned a most detailed description of a moth-eaten mongrel.
One of our mutual friends recently got a letter from her and sent me an extract from it.
I was not at all pleased with the theoretical part of the letter.
She says that Bernstein offers nothing in the way of theory—“That is some sort of idiocy!” But the practical significance of the book, she says, is tremendous; he has turned his attention to the needs of the masses and calls for reality, for concrete things.
She believes the book to be a success because the orthodox trend had begun to pall.
She says about the resolution ** * This letter has been lost.
—Ed.
** This apparently refers to the “Protest by Russian Social-Demo-crats” (Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.
167-182).
—Ed.
that here energy finds an outlet in inventing a path that development must follow.
In general, Lirochka to me is now an X.
She and I for-merly held astonishingly identical views, but something has been happening to her in the past three years and I don’t understand her any more.
Perhaps we would come to an agreement if we met, but there’s something lacking in our correspondence.
She is not the Li-rochka I knew and it is no use writing about mists, weather and so on, and she doesn’t seem to want to write about anything else, and she can’t, anyway.
To tell the truth, I cannot reconcile myself to her marriage.
Her husband * created the impression on me of a kind of narrow self-assurance.
.
.
.
But I have said too much on this subject.
Good-bye.
Kiss Anyuta and give M.

my regards.

25, Bakhmetyevskaya Street, Moscow March 30 Dearest Manyasha, The day before yesterday I sent a letter to you and M.
A.
and yesterday got one from you.
I am very glad that M.
A.
may possibly go to visit Volodya, as it looks as if I shall not be able to move from here for a long time.
Yes, Volodya has got thinner, but it was only very recently that he lost weight, before that he looked very healthy.
I think it is not so much the catarrh that bothers him as insomnia.
Recently his insomnia has been chronic, he was very excited before our departure and the frosts were so fierce that he did not go out at all.
As soon as we set out Volodya cheered up and began * K.
M.
Takhtarev.
—Ed.
to eat and sleep properly.
I think he will be able to check the catarrh with the waters that did him good before; in general, Volodya takes care of his health.
He writes that he is being well fed.
It is a pity, of course, that he has to live away from the family.
I gathered from your letter that Yuly came to see you and so all my news is now stale.
I am sending you my translation and the book.
I don’t understand any of the underlined passages and, apart from that, I imagine I have translated a lot of the rest all wrong.
I do not know the language at all, and the dictionary is little help; one phrase often has several meanings the way I read it.
You must take a look at the entire trans-lation and correct it where it is wrong.
That’s all.
Good-bye, my darling Englishwoman.

and Anya.

Written March 3 0 , 1 9 0 0 Sent from Ufa First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original 21 TO LENIN’S MOTHER July 26 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, I have just received a postcard from Volodya, sent from Austria.
.
.
.
The letters are a long time on the way—I got the postcard on the eighth day, which means I shall receive Volodya’s letters on the ninth or tenth day.
Volodya writes that he feels very well and I am very, very pleased about it, of course.
How are you keeping? Are you quite well? After the impassable mud and the dampness here, we are now enjoying wonderful days.
You are probably having excellent weather too and you can take advantage of the summer.
Things are all right here now.
I am sorry you and Anyuta got such an unfavourable impression of Ufa; the weather was terribly muggy at the time and our place was all higgledy-piggledy.
We are still living in the same apart-ment but we shall probably soon be moving to a winter apartment, an excellent one that we have tried, across the road diagonally from us.
I am now quite well and so is Mother.
She sends you all her regards.
When Volodya was staying here in Ufa he wrote Filippov a scath-ing letter about his having printed Volodya’s article in such distortedform.
* A letter came from Filippov after Volodya had left in which he tried to gloss it over.
“Dear Sir, an opportunity of settling the affair has occurred.
I am sending you the manuscript of Skvortsov’s article, so that you can reply.
I ask you to bear the censorship conditions in mind and keep the article short.
” It seemed as if he wanted to appease Volodya by sending him the article, but two days later he changed his mind and sent another letter, this time not for forwarding to V.
I.
as before, but to be forwarded to Mr.
Ulyanov.
The outward appearance of the letter alone was evidence of his disdain—a torn-off half sheet of paper on which the letter had been typed with correc-tions to the typing.
The letter was foolishly abusive, the man does not seem to understand what he is talking about.
I wrote him that I had received the two letters and could not send them on to Volodya because I did not know his address, but would send them immediately I did; I said I was returning the manuscript because if it were sent abroad there would be a long delay in getting it printed and the author would hardly be likely to approve of it.
Volodya would probably not want to accept favours from that idiot.
Skvortsov’s article is also excessively abusive.
The same meaningless quotations from Marx and complete failure to understand one’s opponent.
There is no point even in polemicising with such a person.
I doubt whether Volodya will answer him.
Maria Andreyevna called the day after Volodya’s departure.
She was very nice and awfully kind.
I felt a twinge of conscience—I do not know how to be nice to people.
I wanted to demonstrate my kind-ness by offering to help her make jam, only I remembered in time that I had never made any jam and the Lord alone knows what I might have made.

They are going to live at the farmhouse all the win-ter.

22 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA July 26 Thank you, Manyasha dear, for the books and the photograph— that is probably your doing—and for the postscript to Volodya’s letter.
I have been intending to write for a long time but kept on put-ting it off.
How are you all? I have not heard anything of you for ages.
When are you thinking of returning to town, what plans have you made for the winter? When I received a letter from Volodya saying that Maria Alexandrovna and Anyuta were coming with him I was very glad and thought I would be able to discuss everything with Anyuta.
There are many things I wanted to talk about.
When they arrived, however, I was so distracted that all my ideas flew away— and there were other visitors here besides the family.
It turned out that I did not have a real talk at all and I do not know when I shall see them again.
Oh well, we shall see what will happen; I have only seven and a half months left to remain in Ufa, the time will pass very quickly.
I have found pupils to teach and am taking German lessons myself.
I have discovered a German from Berlin and with some dif-ficulty persuaded him to talk to me twice a week.
So far we have had only one talk.
The German is a chatterbox, so I may get something out of it.
In addition to that I have been reading the silliest German novels and have been so busy at my German that I do not go any-where; I am becoming unsociable and have no desire to go anywhere.
Good-bye.
I embrace you fondly.

Did Volodya tell you that a young lady from here is coming to see you? She is the niece of an old acquaintance.
Tell her whatever you can about studies at Brussels University.

Nevertheless, I will write.
I am keeping perfectly well, so is Mother.
It is three weeks now since we moved to a new apartment.
It is very convenient, downstairs, two rooms and a kitchen, newly decorated, and a garden under our win-dows; the owners are nice people.
We lived in this apartment once before, but now it has quite a different appearance.
Our address is Priyutskaya Street, Kulikova’s House.
We seem to have settled down at last.
I am now pretty busy; I still retain my summer pupils and winter lessons have also begun.
Two lessons will remain for the win-ter, both quite pleasant and paying quite well (62 rubles).
I shall spend about 6 hours a day on them.
Since I like teaching, it will be quite all right, not a bit tiring.
The bad thing is the mud in Ufa, you can drown in it, and in the evenings, when there is supposed to be a moon and the streets remain unlit for that reason, you are quite likely to land up in a ditch—and one of my lessons is in the evening.
On Sundays I take German lessons from an excellent German.
Every-thing would have been all right except that there has been so much commotion at our place lately that I have not been able to take up a book for a fortnight.
And so I have not been busy at my German at all and that is a great pity.
Volodya complains of the turmoil of life in Paris, but that is Paris and turmoil is in the nature of things; but when there is turmoil in Ufa it is like nothing on earth.
This, of course, is the time when some people are going, some are coming and others are passing through.
People passing through say that Zina is very miserable, that she has recently changed very considerably, and grown thin and pale.
They also say that Mikh.
Al.
is having a bad time, and that O.
A.
could not find any pupils for a long time.
Mikh.
Al.
has been posted to the Krasnoyarsk Regiment, a regiment that was about to set out on a march (it has started by now).
The Siberians are lazy correspondents and so I know little about them.
I am partly to blame, by the way.
Lidya intends moving to Ufa, she has made anapplication, but I don’t know whether she will be able to get trans-ferred; I should very much like to see her before I leave here.
Volodya writes very rarely and has apparently given me the wrong address, since he does not seem to have received my letters.
I am now writing to him in Paris.
I don’t know where to send the magazine he asks for, Zhizn.
In the end I shall probably send it to you, perhaps he has given you his proper address.
I gathered from his last letter that he is leaving Paris but he did not say where for.
I am returning Manya-sha’s French book together with Zhizn.
She wrote that she had to return it in September.
Anyuta, by the way, took a Gorky book to read in the train and its owner is asking for it back; if it is not too much trouble, please send it to me.
I ask Manyasha to excuse me for not writing to her separately—I should only have to repeat everything.
How are you? Are you keeping well? Has Anyuta gone for long? Have you received a reply from St.
Petersburg about whether D.
I.
has been accepted into the University? Are you moving to Moscow soon? Well, good-bye.
Many, many kisses for you and Manyasha.
Mother sends regards to all.
Yours, Nadya P.
S.
Have just made a discovery—I have not got the issue of Zhizn that Volodya wrote about and so am sending only the French book.

At the end of August I wrote to Maria Alexandrovna a most minutely detailed letter describing my way of life.
I wanted to send the Frenchbook with a young lady who was supposed to come to visit you but who, it turned out, had found a travelling companion to go to Paris with; I think she is going to Paris for no particular purpose, just for amusement, she has not much intention of studying and cannot come to Podolsk.
And so I sent the book to you by post, I did not go to the post office myself and in my hurry forgot to write “Registered” on the parcel and so it went by ordinary book post.
I am afraid it might get lost.
Please write and let me know if you received it.
Speak-ing of books—when Volodya was staying here he promised to send an acquaintance The Development of Capitalism but forgot to do it and now asks for it to be done.
To prevent any unnecessary posting please send one copy direct to the following address: Birsk (Ufa Gubernia), Pavel Fyodorovich Savinov.
I think that is all there is to be done.
Has D.
I.
got anything? When are you moving to Moscow? Are you all well? When is Anya returning? There are no changes here, we are both well.
I am busy with my teaching, I teach all subjects, even Latin; there are crowds of people here with nothing to do, as before; I am busy with German but there seems very little time for it.
It is, of course, much easier to study the language with a German teacher than to work alone.
Volodya seldom writes, says little about himself and complains of the turmoil.
Olga Alexandrovna is not coming to Ufa because she has got fixed up in Krasnoyarsk, and Mikhail Alexandrovich is in the regular army.
Zina is anxious to get to Russia and does not write in very great detail.
I am expecting to see a returning comrade in a few days; he should have passed through here a long time ago but he was taken ill with dysentery just before he left and is still recovering slowly.
Here in Ufa there is absolutely impassable mud such as I have never in my life seen before, and all the time it is raining, raining.
.
.
.
Perfectly beastly.
Well, good-bye, many kisses for you, for you and Maria Alexan-drovna.

You probably moved to Moscow a long time ago.
How are you? Are you keeping well? Has D.
I.
left for Yu-riev? Will Manyasha’s case soon come to an end? * I once received a letter from Anyuta and answered it immediately, but my letters are not always delivered at the proper time and I sometimes receive letters from Volodya in different order from what he wrote them in.
Although Volodya now writes more frequently, I still know very little about the way he is living there; I know he has taken up some English language courses, and that he cannot get into his stride.
.
.
.
Zina and her husband blame me for not writing enough about Volodya, but what can I write to them? Volodya is quite unable to write about the ordinary side of life.
Let him write to them himself.
They are not thinking of moving to Russia yet and have not done anything about it—I think they should.
It will soon be March 11 and even Zina will be her own mistress then.
Five months and eleven days—I no longer know whether that is much or little.
I do not know whether I shall be able to leave Ufa on the 11th by the morning train as I have long been intending.
Incidentally, there is nothing so very bad about Ufa except the mud, and I have long since become an Ufa patriot.
We have fixed ourselves up well—in provincial style—a good apart-ment, good food, etc.
, in short we have adapted ourselves somewhat to provincial life.
Time goes like a machine that has been wound up and I have some nice children as pupils.
In general, I am very fond of teaching children, and at the moment the children are very nice, especially one tiny little girl.
I give lessons to the numerous progeny of a local millionaire merchant—he has five of them.
They are very strict, the way our merchants are, and I actually like the way the children are brought up.
The parents do not dress them up, they have * Lenin’s sister Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova was arrested on Sep-tember 30, 1899 and sent to Nizhny Novgorod until the preliminary investigation was over.
She returned to Moscow at the end of Decem-ber.
—Ed.
very few toys, no nursemaids, plenty of freedom, the youngsters are in the street all day, the children clean their own boots, tidy up their rooms (even wash clothes).
In general, there is nothing aristocratic about them and they are not spoiled.
They all learn very willingly, both the youngsters and the older ones.
The youngest girl (seven years old) is very nice, a delightful character, clever, pretty, and such an industrious and attentive pupil I have never seen.
Every day she is “simply longing” to read, write and do arithmetic.
And when there is something just a bit more interesting, her eyes flash.
She now waits for me every time on the staircase and reports to me on all the events in the lives of the children.
In short, this little girl has completely captivated me.
Such wonderful children do exist! She is a happy-go-lucky kid, laughs a lot and has not been drilled (sometimes she wipes her nose on her frock).
There is also a nice boy, but of a different kind.
In general, I usually get interested in the boys and girls I teach, the pity is that the lessons take up too much time, they are foolishly arranged.
I have taken up some French language courses here (soon German courses will open).
Three times a week, an hour a time, six rubles a month; the courses are conversational, and so far I am very satisfied.
I am the senior in a group of four.
The Frenchman is an experienced teacher and conducts a very lively lesson, but the pupils are rather inert.
It is a pity I have no French books here at all, and the French teacher gives us June newspapers to read or magazines with no beginning and no end.
Has Manyasha (she probably has) any French fiction or, in general, any French books< None of the people here know any languages, so I with my half-baked knowledge am considered a specialist in this field; it is difficult to get any foreign books.
I also go to the German teacher and write essays ten pages long for him, but we meet only once a week and that is too little for practice.
I read German fiction on my own, but it’s still more difficult for me to speak German than French.
And that is how the day passes up to 8 o’clock in the evening, and in the evening I am rarely able to do anything, few evenings pass without somebody calling in.
There you have the smallest details of the way I spend my time.
Mother sends her best regards and I send many kisses.
I shall not write a separate letter to Manyasha since I should only have to repeat what I have written, but instead I simply embrace her.
That’s all.
All the best.
Yours, Nadya Sent from Ufa First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original26 TO LENIN’S MOTHER November 8 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, I received your letter a few days ago and yesterday a letter from Manyasha with newspaper cuttings enclosed; many thanks, I have already read them.
I recently wrote to you, but our letters, as usual, crossed in the post.
I am now better, but Mother is still feeling rather bad, first she has palpitation, then she catches cold.
We now have an excellent apartment, even a piano.
We have an acquaintance who sings well and we manage some music in the evenings, rather strange music, it is true, for the piano groans, wheezes and rattles, but still it is music.
Visitors make Mother tired and I, too, would be glad if they did not come so often; the fact of the matter is that I come home so tired at nine o’clock that there is not much I can do, anyway.
A few days ago I got a letter from Volodya that was two and a half weeks on the way and another that took a fortnight.
The letters take a terribly long time to come.
Volodya advises me to make a start with my English but I don’t suppose I shall follow his advice.
I have arranged with the German to have lessons three times a week and things will go better.
Apparently I have been infected by Volodya’s idée fixe—I must master languages at all costs.
I now have some other work in addition to my teaching and language lessons and in the spring I will tell you all about it in detail.
Only four months are left to March, when I shall come to you and then go on to Volodya.
At the moment I am not allowing myself to think deeply on this sub-ject, because if I do the time will drag heavily.
I don’t know what to do about getting to Moscow in spring; I suppose it would be the wrong thing to tender an application before-hand.
But why should I start guessing in advance? Spring is a long way off.
It is winter here, a good, healthy winter.
I hope the time will pass quickly for you until Christmas, and that at Christmas.

Printed from the original27 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA Her Excellency Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, Sharonov’s House, Bakhmetyevskaya Street, Moscow December 2 Dear Manyasha, Many thanks for the album, excuse me for the trouble I have caused you in getting it sent on; thanks also for bothering to supply me with French books.
I have not yet managed all the old ones for I read terribly little.
I know very well that unless I read I cannot master a language, but there is no time.
How I sometimes envy you your solitude! It would give me the greatest pleasure to pore over my books of an evening, but I never manage to.
Hustle, bustle and again hustle! One would have thought this could be avoided in Ufa.
I do not know how it happens because I am not, I believe, very sociable.
It is true that I have lost my shyness, only on rare occasions am I overcome by a sudden wave of shyness and cannot utter a word; now, however, that rarely happens and soon passes, but it used to be a real misfortune.
That is why I understand you so well when you write about .
your being shy.
I know what a tormenting feeling it is and how difficult it is to get over it.
.
.
.
I have another request to make of you.
Volodya asked for someone to write to Filippov about manuscripts and about payment for the Skvortsov article.
I am writing about the manuscripts today but a letter must be written to Soikin about payment, mentioning the exact number of pages.
I have not got a copy of Nauchnoye Obozreniye handy, so I cannot count the number of pages; more important than that—I am afraid there may be some delay in sending the money and that I shall have left Ufa in the meantime—I want to avoid complications.
It is also possible that Filippov has sent the money to Moscow and that may make things awkward.
So please write to Soikin in Volo-dya’s name telling him to send the money to you.
I think it would be better to do this before the New Year.
What were you sick with? What did you have, influenza? I hope you have completely recovered.
.
.
.
Have you? And is Maria Alexan-drovna keeping well? For some reason you did not write anything about her.
What are you doing? What are you reading? If you have not gone abroad by that time, we shall see one anotherin March.
Only three and a half months left, actually not very much.
Do you know, I sometimes wonder whether I shall be given a pass-port to go abroad with Volodya away, perhaps his consent is neces-sary.
Do you know whether Mark Timofeyevich’s consent was required before a passport was issued to Anyuta? In general, as we get nearer to March I am getting alarmed at the possibility of delays.
It is true that Volodya’s letters have now become calmer and he writes that he is quite well, but it would not be a bad thing if those three months passed more quickly.
The Siberians write very seldom, and from people passing through I have learned only that Gleb has grown thin and Zina has got fat.
That’s not much.
Well, good-bye, I embrace you fondly and kiss you.
Many, many kisses for Maria Alexandrovna as well.
Mother sends regards.
Yours, N.
Ulyanova Written December 2 , 1 9 0 0 Sent from Ufa to Moscow First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original 28 TO LENIN’S MOTHER AND HIS SISTER MARIA December 22 Dear Maria Alexandrovna and Manyasha, It seems quite a time since I wrote to you.
Today I am in something of a holiday-eve mood and I am spending the day in a most unusual manner.
I shall not have any lessons for a fortnight, yesterday I gave my last lesson, my French teacher has also gone away for the holidays, and so I am, as the saying goes, as free as the birds of the air.
I began today by cleaning up the house and then got down to letter-writing and finishing off all kinds of unfinished jobs.
I wanted to write you a letter for Christmas but I have been so busy, and this letter will probably arrive in the New Year, if you bear in mind the holidays and the snowdrifts.
I wish you, dear people, a happy New Year; I send you many kisses and wish you good health and everything, everything that is good.
I hope that this year I shall be able to spend some time with you.
Mother also sends her best wishes.
Here it is “seriously”cold, thirty below zero every day, and sometimes there is a snowstorm on top of the frost.
I parade in Mother’s fur coat and felt boots and she does not go out at all—the cold immediately takes her breath away.
The post is greatly delayed by the snowstorms.
How are you spending the holidays? Has D.
I.
arrived? Oh, there’s something else—what is Anyuta’s address? I wrote to her at Volodya’s address a long time ago and do not know if she received my letter.
I’d like to write to her, but I don’t know where to send a letter.
Olga Alexandrovna, from whom I recently received a letter, is also asking about the address.
What a pity, Manyasha dear, that they would not let you go abroad—I had already begun to envy you.
Perhaps we shall be able to go together.
I am trying not to think of spring and my journey yet; if I do, I get lost in wild ideas.
People had a good laugh at my expense yesterday.
I started crossly trying to preach that it was essential to maintain an even temper and got so angry that I proved brilliantly that I was not even-tempered myself.
Unfortunately my acquaintances are all nervous wrecks, people with “moods”; of course, if one’s nerves are out of order there is nothing one can do about it, only why let oneself go—that I cannot stand.
Olga Alexandrovna writes that they are badly off; she is living in Krasnoyarsk where Mikhail Alexandrovich enjoys some privileges on account of her.
She has one small lesson, a poor one, and hopes to find another.
M.
A.
gets terribly fatigued by army service and is bored by doing nothing and being a soldier.
All the Siberians write regularly, except the Taiga and Omsk people, who maintain an unconscionable silence.
Gleb, they say, is completely worn out at his job; I am sur-prised that they hang on there.
We live on the main highway and people are passing through all the time so that we have a life of variety.
Not long ago one of our Minusinsk acquaintances was here; he had been released for a month to visit his mother.
By the way, Manyasha, you asked me about O.
,* you wanted to know what sort of person she is.
I have very little personal knowledge of her but have heard many good things about her.
I had intended to send a letter with her but, first, she did not go direct and, second, I had influenza at the time and could not think properly.
I thought she would get to know Anyuta.
Here I am, chattering away nineteen to the dozen.
My study of lan-guages is making poor headway.
I suppose I am not good at them.

Yours, Nadya The Kautsky translation * is not here now, it was sent temporarily to Astrakhan, it will be returned soon, but Volodya has asked for it to be sent to him, only I don’t know if it’s fit for posting, it has acquired such a battered look.
Written December 2 2 , 1 9 0 0 Sent from Ufa to Moscow First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin’s Letters to Relatives Printed from the original 1901 29 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA February 2 Dear Manyasha, I have not answered your last letter until now because when I received it I wrote to Astrakhan asking then to send me the Counter-criticism quickly; so far I have not had a reply but expect one in a couple of days.
In the meantime ask Filippov for the translation, I wrote to him once at Volodya’s request, asking him to send all Volodya’s manuscripts to your address.
I suppose he has not sent them.
I was beginning to let my correspondence lag but today I am in a tranquil mood and am, therefore, inclined to chatter, although there is actually nothing to chat about.
Nothing here has changed except that the sun is shining in a joyful, springlike way, and I just dream of spring, I keep returning to the idea that there are only six weeks left and then .
.
.
then I shall be quite crazy with joy, especially when I have travelled to where Volodya is.
At present there is no time to get really bored, there is plenty of work of all kinds.
I ought to be trying to get everything done in time, but sometimes I laze around unpardonably, really unpardonably.
I feel the urge to go out and * This refers to the manuscript of Lenin’s translation of Karl Kautsky’s book Bernstein und das sozialdemokratische Programm.
Eine Antikritik, Stuttgart, 1899.
—Ed.
sometimes, instead of sitting down to work, I go wandering about the streets and once I started reading a novel first thing in the morn-ing.
The boredom in Ufa is terrible, but you can build up your health here—I, for instance, have got so fat lately it’s simply awful.
But Mother cannot boast of her health, she is always feeling poorly.
She is already making preparations to leave, and is busy sewing something and counting the days.
After Ufa, you know, only Moscow and St.
Petersburg are banned; at least there have been three such cases.
But people do get terribly attached to one place.
They stay put in Ufa, where you can earn good money, or else they move on to Samara.
And what’s good about Samara! Oh how little I read! All this time I have read only Berdyayev.
And how poor is my progress with languages.
I have not been to the French courses since Christmas because our group broke up and the Frenchman teaches me very perfunctorily when I go alone.
I have German lessons on rare occasions.
The results depend on my mood, sometimes I chatter away well enough and sometimes I say the weird-est things.
All our people in Ufa have now joined forces with Samar-skaya Gazeta and write for it—so do I.
* Since I have so little expe-rience in this field, it causes me plenty of worry.
Altogether I am making attempts this year to get into the literary world.
Some of the attempts are successful, but the trouble is that I cannot write the way I want to and I just hate my stuff.
That’s that.
Why don’t you write anything about yourself? How are you? When is your case coming to an end? Good-bye, or rather, au revoir! Many kisses.
I fond-ly embrace Maria Alexandrovna and send her many kisses; I am ter-ribly impatient to get to Moscow.
Mother sends regards to all.
Good-bye, Manyasha dear, excuse me for my unpunctuality.

30 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA February 12, 1901 Dear Manyasha, Many thanks for the cuttings.
I read them with great interest.
I have just received a notice from the post office about the arrival of a parcel.
I suspect it is the Kautsky manuscript; if it is, I will send it to you tomorrow for certain.
It is a great pity that there has been such a delay.
Do you know whether Essays and Studies is obtainable? People are begging me to get a copy, they write that it is not on sale anywhere.
Just a month left.
Wonderful, isn’t it? The time will come when there is just one day left! Yes, everything will come! There is something I almost forgot.
Mother has a big request to make of you.
She would like you to insure a lottery ticket she has, serial number 738; this has to be done before March 1 and it cannot be done in Ufa because if the ticket wins it will become known here only in April and she would have to come back to Ufa—in short, it would not be worth her while.
Keep the receipt yourself.
The insur-ance will cost about three rubles, Mother wanted to send the money now, but I managed to convince her that it would do when she sees you.
That’s that.
Are we really going to miss Anya? I want very much to see her.
Write and tell me when she thinks of coming.
I shall have another journey to make, to Astrakhan, and I do not know whether I should go to Moscow before or after—I am thinking of making it dependent on when Anya will come.
Well, good-bye for the time being.
This week there have been such crowds of people here that I am awfully glad the holidays are over.
Many kisses for you and Maria Alexandrovna, and I embrace you both.
Mother sends regards.
Hoping to see you soon.
Yours, Nadya Has Filippov sent you any sort of an answer? The blockhead! Sent from Ufa to Moscow First published in 1 9 2 9 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.
1 1 Printed from the original31 TO LENIN’S MOTHER June 11, 1901 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, I have not written all this time because at first I relied on Anyuta to describe our way of life and after that Mother and Volodya wrote to you.
We are all quite well, and Volodya shows no sign of catarrh.
Mother is also keeping well.
She finds life with us very monotonous, but I do not.
It is true that Volodya and I are terrible homebirds.
So far I have been to only one picture gallery and know practically nothing about the town.
That is partly because it is summer and when we go for walks we go out in the country, not to town.
We are living in a suburb, where we have the conveniences of a big city— shops, trams, etc.
—combined with the proximity of the country.
Yesterday, for instance, we went for a good walk along the road.
It is a marvellous road lined with poplars and with fields and orchards on all sides.
We have been for only one long ride and that was not a success—we got caught in a storm and came home very tired.
We are thinking of going to the mountains some time.
Anyuta kept advis-ing us to move to a village for the summer.
Mother, too, thinks it would be better, but for many reasons it would be inconvenient.
We cannot move too far because Volodya would have to travel to town every day, and that would be too tiring.
Apart from that he goes to the library fairly often.
There is a park and a place to bathe not far from us—about twenty minutes walk.
In general life here is grad-ually beginning to conform to a pattern and Volodya is getting along better with his work.
.
.
.
As far as I am concerned, well, I work very little so far, or, to tell the truth, I do not work at all.
Time passes, but where it goes I just don’t know.
I intend to visit the local schools.
This place is a sort of child’s kingdom.
Everybody pays so much attention to them and the chil-dren are so nice and healthy.
I have been in our city schools and cannot help drawing comparisons; I find that the children here live a lot bet-ter.
My intentions will probably remain only intentions.
Still I have plenty of time.
Vodovozova has sent a cheque for six hundred odd marks, but I have not yet received the money or any letter.
Altogether people in Russia write terribly little to us, we might well think that all our old friends have forgotten our existence.
There has not been a whisper either from Zina or Bazil.
.
.
.
Nor do we know whether Gleb has left that Taiga of his.
.
.
.
How are you getting on, dear Maria Alexandrovna? Are you keep-ing well? Give D.
I.
my regards.
A letter for Manyasha is enclosed, * and give M.

Is there anything new? Is anything more known? Our people all send regards and I send many kisses.

to send three copies of The Development of Capitalism to the doctor.
Sent from Munich to Podolsk First published in 1 9 2 9 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsiya No.
1 1 Printed from the original 32 TO LENIN’S MOTHER July 16, 1901 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Anyuta has sent us your letter to Volodya and also Manya’s letter.
Why did they not give Manya my letter? Very odd! It would be a good thing if the rumours that she is shortly to be released came true.
.
.
.
When you see Manya, tell her that I send her my best regards and many, many kisses.
I was greatly surprised at the place in your letter where you said that Volodya would know about your way of life from your letter to Mother.
That letter must have gone astray because Mother has not received a letter from you and quite recently told me to ask whether you had received her letter.
Mother is ill all the time, she has a cough and sleeps poorly.
Today she went with us to the bathing place, and got terribly tired, though it is no more than fifteen minutes walk.
We go almost every day, the bathing here is excellent and, in general, although we live in a town the country is very near to us.
It is a fine place in all respects.
It is now quite warm, but not too hot to bear.
The time seems to pass awfully quickly.
Somehow you scarcely notice how week after week goes by; it is not as if there was a lot to do, although it seems “you never do anything but are never without something to do”.
* The letter has been lost.
—Ed.
I am taking up German again, it’s a nuisance not to know the language; I have found a German woman who will give me lessons in exchange for Russian lessons.
We’ll see how it goes.
Volodya and I keep intending to go to a German theatre, but we are terribly inac-tive in this respect, we keep saying “we ought to go” and that is the end of it, for something else always intervenes.
Anyuta is more active in that sphere.
By the way, I have to admit that our present mood is not very suitable for it.
To get the best out of a foreign country you have to go there when you are young and are interested in every little thing.
.
.
.
However, I am in general satisfied with our pres-ent way of life; at first it was a bit miserable, everything very alien, but now, as we are beginning to take part in the life of the local people, that feeling is disappearing.
The only thing is that people in Russia are miserly with their letters.
Well, I must stop.
I embrace you fond-ly, my dear.
Keep well and cheerful.
Mother sends regards to you and Dm.
I.
We are awaiting a letter from him.
All the very, very best.

1 1 Printed from the original 33 TO LENIN’S MOTHER August 2 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, We received your letter to Volodya yesterday.
Unfortunately we see from it that nothing has changed, and I did not write to Manyasha the last time because I thought she would soon be with you.
But good things always happen when you least expect them.
Sometimes, when I have been away from home a long time and my thoughts have been occupied with something altogether different I find myself coming home with the idea that there simply must be a telegram waiting to say that our folks are with you.
.
.
.
Please, dearest, when you go to see Manyasha, give her many, many kisses from me and give M.
T.
my regards.
I will write to Manyasha.
There are no changes here.
Volodya is now working quite hard andI am glad for his sake; when he throws himself completely into some task he feels well and strong—that is one of his natural qualities; he is in very good health, there does not seem to be a trace of the cat-arrh left and no insomnia, either.
Every day he takes a cold rub down and we go bathing almost every day, too.
But Mother is always feel-ing poorly, first rheumatism, then general weakness, and then she catches cold.
In a week or so Volodya and I intend going to Switzerland for a short time to see Anyuta.
I am very glad that Anyuta did not go to Rügen, as she originally intended, but to Lake Thun.
It is probably better there.
We are going for only a few days, but I am looking for-ward to the journey with pleasure—first, I want to see Anyuta, and second, I want to have a look at the mountains.
I don’t know what these mountains are like, I have never seen them, except in pictures.
While we are away, an acquaintance of ours is going to stay with Mother, so she will not be afraid of being alone.
In the autumn Mother wants to go to St.
Petersburg; I am trying to persuade her to spend the winter with us but do not know what she will decide.
Summer is drawing to a close and I have not even noticed how it passed; it is as though there has been no summer.
Summer is not a real summer in town.
Well, good-bye, dearest, I embrace you fondly and wish you health and strength.
Give D.
I.
my regards and thank him for the book I received a long time ago.
Mother sends regards to all.

What aboutManyasha? Have you got decently fixed up, have you rented a suit-able apartment? We are all well.
This is a wonderful autumn and Volodya and I often go out in the country.
Mother is gradually getting used to the new surroundings, although she does not like big cities.
She sends her regards to all.

1 1 Printed from the original 1903 35 TO LENIN’S MOTHER March 4, 1903 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, It is ages since I wrote to you, so long that I have even forgotten when I sent my last letter.
The fact of the matter is that I have com-pletely forgotten how to write letters and regard them with feelings of loathing.
Every time it requires quite a lot of will power to take up the pen.
Once I start to write, however, the letter writes itself, I even begin to like it, but it is very difficult to start.
Volodya is not at home now, * he has gone for a breath of fresh air.
I am always glad when he makes a trip somewhere because it has a very refreshing effect on him.
A change of surroundings soothes the nerves—otherwise life drags on very monotonously, the same impres-sions and the same people day after day.
And one does get sick of poring over books.
This time I wanted to go with Volodya but again it didn’t come off—a lot of work had piled up and Mother is so very sick that I did not want to, could not, in fact, leave her alone.
She * In late February and early March 1903 Lenin visited Paris where he lectured at the Russian Social Sciences Higher School and spoke to Russian political émigrés on the agrarian programme.
—Ed.
has had a very bad attack of influenza and has had to keep to her bed for about a week.
At first the doctor was afraid it might be typhus.
She has now completely recovered, but the weakness remains.
She wants to get out into the country as soon as possible, but we shall not be able to manage it before May, and even then I don’t know how.
Volodya is not keen on going to the country, he is very fond of Prague.
* I have also got used to Prague but shall nevertheless be glad to get away from here.
I should like to write in greater detail about the way we live, but there does not seem to be anything to write.
How I should like to stay with you now! You wrote about your apartment in your last letter and I got a very clear conception of the way you live there.
I was able to picture to myself the frosty weather, the fire in the stove, how you wait for Manya to return from work and how Manya comes in out of the frost.
Life in Samara must be like life in Ufa.
“Give me the wings of a swallow.
.
.
.
” But now I am beginning to ramble.
Sometimes I feel terribly homesick, today especially.
By the way, that is how I am, I am always feeling drawn to somewhere else.
You will probably think we have no amusements at all here, but we go somewhere almost every evening; we have been to the German theatre a number of times and to concerts and we study the people and the local way of life.
It is easier to observe here than anywhere else.
Volodya is very keen on these observations and gets as enthu-siastic about them as about everything he does.
It was hard to begin this letter and now it is a pity to stop.
I embrace you and Manya fondly, my dear ones.
All the best.

4, Kiev Dear Maria Alexandrovna, Your letter came as a great shock to us—and it is so sad.
* I can only hope they will soon be released.
We have heard that there have been wholesale house searches and arrests in Kiev.
During such raids many people are caught in the dragnet.
Judging by the fact that they have arrested all of them, the case will be a trivial one.
I don’t know what conditions in the Kiev lock-ups are like now—they used to be bearable.
Have they allowed you to see anyone? I have asked an acquaintance of mine to visit you.
Since you moved to Kiev so recently, I am afraid you have not got any acquaintances there, the city is a big one and you are strange to it.
It’s a great pity that I have lost the address of a friend of Anyuta’s and cannot write to her.
I shall await your letter anxiously.
Perhaps it will bring pleasanter news.
We are not living too well in Geneva; Mother is often poorly.
We feel unsettled somehow and the work goes badly.

Printed from a typewritten copy (made by the police)1909 37 TO LENIN’S MOTHER Dear Maria Alexandrovna, To begin with, let me embrace you fondly.
This letter is being written mainly to tell you that, because actually there is nothing much to write about.
Manyasha has told you about our way of life.
It differs from last year only in the apartment being very warm and Volodya having become a stick-at-home.
He has been working a lot this winter and he always feels better when he is working.
For over a week now he has been getting up at eight in the morn-ing to go to the library; he returns from there at 2 o’clock.
At first he found it difficult to get up so early, but now he is very satisfied and has begun to go to bed early.
It would be a very good thing if he could manage to keep it up.
To think we have been living in Paris for a whole year already! We have become fairly used to it, but it’s a pity we see so little of the real local life.
Recently we went to a little theatre near here and enjoyed it.
The audience was pure working class, mothers with babies, hatless, lively and talkative.
It was interesting to see the audience’s spontaneous reaction to the play.
They applauded not good or bad acting, but good or bad actions.
The play itself was just as ingenuous, naïve as the audience, with lots of pretty words that suited the taste of the audience.
We got the impression of something very lively, very spon-taneous.
I was sorry that Manyasha was not there.
I was also sorry she was not here when we went to see a demonstration of a hundred thousand people.
* That created a very strong impression.
In general we seldom go anywhere, and if we do, only on Sundays.
How are your eyes? Are they getting better? Mother, too, often complains that it is difficult for her to read in the evenings.
Is the light good in your apartment? A pity it’s chilly, though.
It’s a good thing you’re living with somebody you know.
If they are nice people, it’s much pleasanter.
Perhaps you will take a place together somewhere later on.

Again, I embrace you fondly.
Mother sends very best regards.
I wrote to Manyasha recently and yesterday I made a discovery—my letter to her was lying undisturbed in Volodya’s pocket! How many times have I sworn I would never give him letters to post.

1911 39 TO LENIN’S MOTHER August 26 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, I have been intending to write to you for a very long time, but there is always something that prevents it.
A few days ago we received Anya’s letter.
The money, 100 francs, Volodya received a long time ago, but the list of books to be bought and sent with that money has not arrived.
We see from your postcards and Anya’s letter that the arrangement in Berdyansk was not a real summer affair.
It looks urban rather than rural, though, of course, there’s the bathing.
.
.
.
Our sum-mer has not been very fortunate, either.
Mother got ill several times, she had pneumonia and the doctor said that her lungs are, in general, not in good condition, that she needs rest, good food, and so on.
In that respect our place here is no good; there is not the tiniest garden round the house, not even a yard, and if we want to get out of doors we have to go somewhere, which is not the same thing at all.
It is hot in the house and noisy.
Although the food is good—we eat in a commune and the cuisine is Russian, filling, home-cooked food—we have to walk a verst through the town and that is very tiring; we have begun taking the meals home but there is the bother of washing the dishes.
.
.
.
In short, it means nothing to a healthy person but is bad for one who is ill.
And the heat here is simply unbearable.
Mother is better but the illness set her back a lot, she coughs and has fits of depres-sion.
Volodya is making good use of the summer.
He does his work out in the open, rides his bicycle a lot, goes bathing and is altogether pleased with country life.
This week we have been cycling our heads off.
We made three excursions of 70 to 75 kilometres each, and have explored three forests—it was fine.
Volodya is extremely fond of excursions that begin at six or seven in the morning and last until late at night.
But the result is that we don’t get our work done.
Still, never mind! The weather is beginning to break.
We have the rooms here until September 13, but if the weather keeps fine we can arrange with the landlord to stay longer.
That would be good but there will be a big problem.
The commune closes early in September, there is nowhere to cook at home and the restaurant is bad and expensive.
We have,indeed, fixed ourselves up here very cheaply.
For the apartment we pay 10 francs a month, dinner and supper cost 1 franc 30 centimes a head.
There are some other expenses, of course, but they are insignifi-cant.
Volodya is not sure when to advise Anya to come—now or later, direct to Paris.
As regards work—he is busier at the moment, although it is difficult to foresee what will happen in autumn.
Living conditions are better in town, things are pretty inconvenient here.
I think Anya should come when it best suits her, it doesn’t make much difference to us.
Volodya will be very busy during the next couple of weeks or so.
Only she should not come while we are moving; although that does not really matter, either.
The moving job is not difficult.
How long it is since we met!.
.
.
Well, I have told you everything there is to know about us and now I give you both many kisses.
For your health’s sake try to take advantage of the bathing before you leave.
Mother sends best regards.

Many thanks.
Today, at long last, we moved back to town, there have been some fine autumn days lately, but today it is cold and raining.
Mother has caught cold again recently and coughs a lot.
Volodya is going away for a few days, * and has asked me to go with him to the exhibition in Turin but I shall not be able to go, although I should like to make the trip.
Still, I have had a good rest this summer and am more attracted to books than to holiday-making.

This is only by way of greeting.
Written September 2 1 , 1 9 1 1 Sent from Paris to Moscow First published in the Fourth Edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original 1912 41 TO LENIN’S SISTER ANNA March 9 Dear Anya, This year I have somehow fought shy of letter-writing.
Life goes on so monotonously here that I don’t know what to write about.
This winter I have been at home working persistently and for months on end have not left this part of the town.
It has been raining all the time and I could not go cycling or walking.
I have read little and have not been to any lectures.
That is probably why I got so fed up with the winter.
I am glad that spring has come, it is very early this year.
Volodya and I have already been out in the country a couple of times.
It is true that after these excursions I was so tired I couldn’t budge, but it was wonderful, all the same.
This week has been all going out.
We went to the theatre, the play was idiotic, but these French fairly yelled their heads off.
Still, there was some wonderful music during the entr’actes—Chaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin.
Today we are going to see Sophocles’ Electra.
.
.
.
And all this because it is spring.
How you have been spoiling us this year with parcels! Because of this Volodya has even learned to help himself from the larder and eats out of turn, i.
e.
, not at the proper times.
Whenever he comes in, he starts eating.
Now he drinks milk before going to bed (instead of wine) and eats eggs in the mornings.
I soaked the herring as you told me and they are very nice, like salmon.
I am thinking of making pancakes soon.
Mother is not feeling very well.
I don’t know what she will do in summer.
First she wants to go to Russia, then she doesn’t want to.
She asks me to send her regards to all.
I have written about my niece.
We very rarely see M.
F.
, he is very busy.
He is in a hurry to finish a translation (this year he has translated three thick books), and has now been given some regular medical translation work.
Kolya * is very pleased with his school, they play the gramophone to the child-ren, tell them stories, give them crosses and teach them to write pot-books.
He is beginning to chatter in French.
That is all the news.
Has Manyasha received my letter? Why has she not written for so long? I embrace you and Maria Alexandrovna fondly, Manyasha too.
I should like to write more about Volodya to make the letter interest-ing, but couldn’t manage it.
Another time, perhaps.
Regards to M.
T.
Somehow you all write very rarely.

I have heard of several such absurd arrests.
But it’s a pity you have to worry so much and so deeply while things are being sorted out.
Look after yourself, my dearest.
I embrace you fondly, and kiss you.

4 Printed from the original 1913 43 TO LENIN’S MOTHER AND SISTER ANNA January 4 Dear Maria Alexandrovna and Anya, The compliments of the season from me and Mother to you and Mark Timofeyevich.
Actually there is nothing to write about.
Life is very monotonous.
I have scarcely any acquaintances here.
Of late I had been getting to know a young girl—not really a girl but the mother of the sweetest baby girl—but she left for Russia a few days ago.
We go walking every day, but don’t overdo it.
The weather is fine, but the mud is awful.
The holidays passed quietly, quite unnoticeably.
The libraries here are Polish and there is a University library, but we are always busy and neither Volodya nor I have ever been to it.
And we have not been to a concert once.
We are all well.
I embrace you and send many kisses.

Today Volodya invited some friends to share the parcel and to celebrate some brilliant publishing plans that emerged today.
He is letting his dreams run away with him, every day a new book .
.
.
all his old notebooks have been perused, old lists of figu-res have been unearthed and the cobwebs wiped lovingly from them.
For the time being many kisses from me and from Mother, who is busy about the house.
About the mustard—that was Volodya inquiring on his own initi-ative—I know how to make mustard.
We are having winter weather here again.
The photographs were so good it was a pity to give them up.
Volodya was particularly pleased with them.
About publishing and so forth, Volodya will probably write him-self.

4 Printed from the original 45 TO LENIN’S MOTHER March 18 Dear Maria Alexandrovna, It is an eternity since we had a letter from you or from Anya and we are very worried, not knowing what the matter is.
Perhaps a letter has gone astray, or perhaps one of you is ill.
It’s so easy to catch cold in spring! Here the grass is already green and dandelions and daisies have appeared, but there is a most annoying wind.
Mother has managed to catch cold and has been wheezing heavily for about a week.
It is a pity she cannot go out.
And so we have been thinking that the * See Letter No.

—Ed.
climate is worse in Saratov and someone may have caught cold.
What does Mark Timofeyevich write? Where is he now? Life here goes on like clockwork and actually there is nothing to write about.
We live as we did in Shushenskoye, from one post to the next.
Until eleven we fill in the time somehow; at eleven the first post-man comes, and then we impatiently await the six o’clock post.
The letters we have been receiving recently are all rather gloomy and so our mood falls into line with them.
We live a sort of reflected life.
Still, I am glad spring has come because the last winter seemed a very long one.
People are already renting places for the summer, but things are very uncertain with us.
Mother will go first to St.
Petersburg if she is strong enough.
The amnesty turned out to be an absolute myth.
I do not know how it will affect Manyasha, but she will get a one-third reduction in any case.
* We have not had a latter from Manyasha for a long time and do not know how she is getting on.
I embrace you and Anya fondly and wish you good health above all else.
I hope her hand is better and that she will manage to write to us.
Volodya, I suppose, will write himself.

46 TO LENIN’S SISTER MARIA Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova, Yekaterininsko-Dvoryanskaya, 40, Vologda, Russia Dear Manyasha, I congratulate you and send you many kisses.
Lidya will stay on at the old place until May because Anna Mikhailovna and Lodik * have come to her.
She has been getting ill rather often recently.
We are moving to the country for five months; it’s lovely there—forest, mush-rooms, mountains, and a stream.
All I am afraid of is that we shall get bored.
It will be good to put Shkurka out to graze.
There is a big verandah attached to the house, just right for him to sit and work.
It is a huge house, big enough for a whole workshop, but for the time being Shkurka and I will be alone there because Mother is going to Russia for a couple of months.
She also sends her congratulations.
I am dreaming of being able to work a little in summer, for although I sit over my books I don’t do any reading at all, and I am really ter-ribly anxious to get down to work.
This month will be wasted.
I am up to my neck in day-to-day affairs and on top of all that it has been discovered that I have thyroid trouble.
The doctor has frightened me and every day I go to the clinic for electrical treatment; that takes three hours and after it I wander about half the day like a lunatic.
They feed me bromide and, in general, it is all terribly sickening.
I intend writing you a long letter but somehow time gets frittered away.

1914 47 TO LENIN’S SISTER ANNA Anna Ilyinichna Yelizarova, Goncharnaya Street, 11, Apt.
23, St.
Petersburg Dear Anya, I have received your postcard with your address.
The news about M.
A.
’s illness is disturbing.
What was wrong with her? Has she com-pletely recovered? And how, in general, are they living there? Oh yes, about Beer.
To translate it, you must first obtain the permission of the author and then find a publisher.
The first can be managed by writing to him, but it will be more difficult to find a publisher.
An acquaint-ance of ours long ago proposed translating Beer and offered it to various publishers, to Semyonov in particular, and they all refused.
Volodya at first thought you should translate §4 and §5 of Chapter Four and all of Chapter Six for Prosveshcheniye, and then came to the conclusion that it would be better to write an article (about Beer) based on these chapters, leaving out all the uninteresting trivialities (which would make the article more popular in form) but retaining the more interesting passages untouched.
If you have received the book, perhaps Manyasha will undertake the job.
Volodya has not yet returned.
* This time he will probably be tired after the journey.
There is quite a lot of work waiting for him at home.
We are already beginning to think about a place for the summer.
Volodya wants to go to the same place as last year.
The place is good for one’s health, although it pours with rain all the time.
The winter has been an unlucky one for us, we have not been able to work much.
It is still three months to summer, by the way.
Perhaps you could obtain something about the public education congress, speeches and so on.
I need them very much.
I have written all about Rabotnitsa ** to twenty places.
The thing seems to be developing sporadically.
Some people seem to have taken the matter up seriously.
I don’t know how it will turn out, but Volodya, by the way, will write to you about it.
Why are you so much against Sibirsky? I embrace you fondly.
I wanted mostly to write to you about Beer.

She is keeping more or less well.
I, too, am keeping well on the whole, only my heart gets rebellious occasionally, apparently owing to the thyroid trouble.
I want to go to the doctor in a day or two and ask him whether it is not a relapse.
I shouldn’t think so.
What does Mark Timofeyevich write? Written January 3 1 , 1 9 14 Sent from Krakow First published in 1 9 2 9 in the Fourth Edition of the Collected Works Printed from a typewritten copy (made by the police) 48 TO LENIN’S SISTER ANNA Dear Anya, The periodical for women is developing sporadically so far.
Moscow has promised to arrange a social evening to get money for it, but I don’t know whether it will come off.
Supplements to the newspa-per would cost more and not less.
A journal would have an organising significance and in that respect is better than supplements.
In St.
Petersburg they say “a hundred rubles is not money”.
I don’t know about that, but somehow we start everything without money.
When the first issue appears, perhaps it will be possible to get some, although, I repeat, I don’t see any in the offing.
I am very worried about how the editorial side will be arranged.
Things so far are in a bad way because there are two of us here and two more in Paris, but as far as the fifth member of the board is concerned things are not so simple.
There are some very competent people in Paris.
You know Lyudmila.
The other is still more reliable as far as principles are concerned and whatever she undertakes she does well.
* I should like the Parisians to co-opt a third person and have an editorial office there, but somehow this is not being done.
The actual editorial office will be in Russia, of course.
I do not think this at all important because the matter is such an elementary one that it will not be difficult to come to an agreement.
At first there will be some slight confusion, then we shall talk matters over and in the end * The Parisians were Lyudmila Stal and Inessa Armand.
—Ed.
we shall be able to work together and everything will be all right.
And the disadvantage is that we are not all competent literary work-ers, and some of our ideas may not be expressed clearly.
.
.
.
Still, I hope everything will turn out all right.
Please write more about this matter.
A few days ago I read through all the articles in our newspapers about women’s affairs and saw that the insurance campaign had made the question of women very prominent.
I have sent a short article on this issue today.
If only I were a competent writer—nothing comes out the way I want it to.
While you are writing a thing it seems good, but when you see it in print you are ashamed to look at it.
I am worried about the article for Prosveshcheniye.
* It is written exclusively from newspaper articles, and from very few newspapers at that.
The resolutions were reported everywhere very differently and many factual errors may easily have crept in.
Apart from that, the article was written at a time when I was feeling very ill and the work did not go well.
Then they wrote to me that E.
K.
** would write about the congress.
His reports were the best.
I was very pleased, but it was my article that appeared.
So there you are.
So please let me have the details about the periodical for women, I think you will get down to it seriously.
It may develop into some-thing big.
At any rate I am beginning to get an appetite for it.

The last letter we had was about your going to the country for the summer.
* You must be back in town by now.
It will be September 11 by the Rus-sian calendar.
.
.
.
Did you have a good rest in summer? I should very much like to know how you are keeping, my dear.
Are you quite well? There are no changes here.
We shall soon be returning to town.
The mountains do me a lot of good.
The thyroid trouble seems to have gone altogether.
This last week we have been having magnificent weather and Volodya and I have been up all the nearby mountains.
Twice I climbed the Rothhorn, 7,500 feet, which gives you an excellent view of the Alps, without getting a bit tired, and that is something not every healthy person can manage.
In view of this I regard my illness as eliminated and am assuming the status of a healthy person.
Now I have a request to make of Anya.
During the winter I studied pedagogy quite a lot and during the summer have been writing a pamphlet on education.
It is almost finished.
It will be quite ready in a month and will amount to nearly a hundred pages.
The subject is “The Elementary School and Democracy”.
I have managed to col-lect quite a lot of interesting material, very little of which has been * By the way, a letter came later saying that Manyasha is visit-ing you.
analysed before.
Do you think some publisher might snap it up? I don’t know the present situation on the book market or whether a publisher can be found.
I will try writing to Gorbunov, although the subject is one that is only of partial interest to his publishing house.
Today I received the last issue of Rech (August 31), which we have recently been reading with particular interest.
It’s a pity we shall not be getting it any more.
We don’t receive any other Russian newspapers.
In general things are bad as far as Russian newspapers and journals are concerned.
In town they are available in the reading-room, but there is a great demand for them and if you come a bit late there’s nothing left; apart from that it is not always convenient to go to the reading-room.
Sovremenny Mir was sent to an acquaintance from another town for one day.
Altogether, on account of the post and the general breakdown everybody gets newspapers by chance.
We are thinking of returning to town in a week.
If the weather is very good we shall try to stay a little longer.
After all, it does not matter where we live.
Well, I must close.
Many kisses for you and Anya and I embrace you both.

Many thanks to Anya for the trouble she is taking; today I received the Zhurnal Zhurnalov and about a week ago a wholepile of the latest educational publications.
I was terribly in need of them.
Thanks, many, many thanks.
Today or tomorrow I shall write her a long letter.
How is Manyasha getting on? Volodya is all the time expecting letters from her.

13, Moscow, Russia December 14 Dear Manyasha, Did you receive the long letter I sent you in spring? I wrote then, amongst other things, that Mother had died, gave some details of our way of life, etc.
* Now I am writing for one special reason.
We shall soon be coming to the end of our former means of subsistence and the question of earn-ing money will become a serious one.
It is difficult to find anything here.
I have been promised a pupil, but that seems to be slow in ma-terialising.
I have also been promised some copying but nothing has come of it.
I shall try something else, but it is all very problematic.
I have to think about a literary income.
I don’t want that side of our affairs to be Volodya’s worry alone.
He works a lot as it is.
The ques-tion of an income troubles him greatly.
This is what I wanted to ask you about.
Lately I have been put-ting in a lot of study on education in general and the history of educa-tion in particular, so I am well equipped in this field.
I have even written a whole pamphlet, “The Elementary School and Democracy”.
The first part of it is ready and is called “The Role of Productive * The letter has been lost.
—Ed.
Labour in Public Education”.
A hundred odd pages.
I think it has turned out quite interesting.
I should like to ask you to find me a publisher.
I can send the manuscript by return of post if asked for.
Perhaps Svobodnoye Vospitaniye or some other publisher would take it.
By the way, I have sent an article on Rousseau to Svobodnoye Vos-pitaniye.
They must have received the letter because they have begun sending me the journal, but I don’t know whether they have received the manuscript.
Can you find out whether they got the article and whether it will be published? I shall soon be sending them something on other, more topical subjects.
I asked Rakhil’s brother * to go to Svobodnoye Vospitaniye, but he has quite a few affairs of his own to look after and is not a very suitable person for such negotiations.
It is a pity, too, that business with the Granats went wrong.
Volodya wrote to them in summer ** but got no answer, and so I don’t know whether they left a place for my article “Labour School”, what size it should be and by what date it had to be submitted.
I am now busy working on the question of apprenticeship.
The libraries in Switzerland are, in general, well equipped and work goes well.
I also have plenty of time, but the real problem is to find whom to write for.
It is difficult to arrange anything from here.
Do what you can.
Do you know what has happened to Lidya? I have had no news of her since summer.
Is she well? How is she doing? I write to our people from time to time, although there is nothing much to write about.
I send you many kisses, dear Manyasha, drop me a couple of lines some time.

Write more often to Volodya, he is always anxious to receive your letters and you have now started writing very occasionally.
It is true that it is somehow difficult to write.
Do you know anything about Lidya, I have had no news of her since spring, although I have written to her.
Many kisses.
Volodya was very pleased to receive your long letter.
Perhaps you will write again some time.
All the best, N.
The newspapers and books have arrived.
Volodya wrote to you when he received them.

Letter No.
12 16This letter was sent from prison to A.
K.
Chebotaryova, wife of I.
N.
Chebotaryov, a close friend of the Ulyanov family; since Lenin had boarded with the Chebotaryovs she was officially recognised as a person to whom he was allowed to write a letter from prison.
The letter, however, was actually addressed to acquaintances who had not been arrested, including Nadezhda Krup-skaya, and its purpose was to find out who else had been arrested besides Lenin.
To avoid mentioning names, Lenin linked up the nicknames of his acquaintances with the contents of scientific books he asked to be sent to him.
This is the first of the letters written in prison that have been preserved.
Here Lenin outlines his plan of work on his book The Development of Capitalism in Russia which he began in prison and finished in exile.

).
The activities of the Zemstvos were under the supervision of the governor and the Ministry of the Interior, who could annul any orders the government did not approve of.

16 21This letter was sent by Lenin on his way to exile in Siberia.
On January 29, 1897, the sentence of exile in Eastern Siberia for three years under the surveillance of the police was confirmed.
Lenin obtained permission to go to his place of exile at his own expense and not under escort; he was ordered in his travel permit to report to the Governor-General of Irkutsk for further instruc-tions.

Apparently Lenin used the surname “Bulochkin” in the plural to include Nadezhda Krupskaya, who was arrested on August 12, 1896.
“What sort of finale was there?” means “What sentence was passed on them?” Letter No.
22 37Lenin, Krzhizhanovsky and Starkov arrived in Minusinsk on May 6, 1897 and were sent from there to their places of exile on May 8.

34 63Lenin’s letters to Struve and Krupskaya proposing the publi-cation of a translation of the second part of Antonio Labriola’sbook in Novoye Slovo have been lost.

Lenin needed these books for his work as a consulting lawyer in Shushenskoye.
He later recalled, “.
.
.
when I was in exile in Siberia I had occa-sion to act in the capacity of a lawyer.
I was not a certified lawyer, because, being summarily exiled, I was not allowed to practise; but as there was no other lawyer in the region, people came and confided their troubles to me.

35 66It has not been established what journal is meant.
It is possible that as early as 1897 the issue of another periodical was planned in view of the constant persecution of Novoye Slovo by the author-ities and of its shaky position.

37 75On January 8, 1898, Lenin sent a telegram to the Director of the Police Department asking for permission for his fiancée, Nadezhda Krupskaya, to spend her period of exile in the village of Shushen-skoye.
Krupskaya sent a request to the Minister of the Interior to be allowed to spend her term of exile in Shushenskoye with her betrothed and to have her sentence reduced from three to two years.
She was given permission to spend her period of exile in Shushenskoye instead of Ufa Gubernia where she had formerly been ordered to go, but the sentence was not reduced.

38 77The plan was put into effect; in the autumn of 1898 the first col-lection of Lenin’s articles under the general title of Economic Studies and Essays by Vladimir Ilyin was published in St.
Peters-burg.
It contained the essays “A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism”, “Gems of Narodnik Project-mongering”, “The Heritage We Renounce”, etc.
Letter No.
38 78This refers to Yukhotsky, who began a campaign of slander against N.
Y.
Fedoseyev while in the Moscow transit prison; he accused him of embezzling money collected for the needs of exiles.
Although such accusations were obviously false, Yukhotsky did not cease his persecution of Fedoseyev even in exile at Verkho-lensk where they were sent at the same time.
Yukhotsky’s per-secution was one of the causes of Fedoseyev’s tragic death.

Lenin used material from the Statistichesky Vremennik for 1866, 1868 and 1872 for his book The Development of Capitalism in Russia.
The book mentioned, Dnevnik vysochaishe razreshonnogo Vto-rogo syezda russkikh deyatelei po tekhnicheskomu i professionalno-mu obrazovaniyu, izdavayemyi komitetom syezda (Diary of the Royally Sanctioned Second Congress of Russian Specialists on Technical and Vocational Education published by the Committee of the Congress), was probably sent to Lenin with a letter in invisible ink.

Letter No.
42 92Lenin did not translate Adam Smith’s book.
Apparently at the time the letter was written he did not know exactly the author or the name of the book he was to translate.
This is confirmed by the fact that a few days later he speaks of having received The History of Trade Unionism by Sidney and Beatrice Webb for translation.
Letter No.
4293Lenin received Book I of the Webbs’ The History of Trade Unio-nism.

Letter No.
50 99This refers to S.
M.
Friedmann whose address was used by exiles to receive literature and money.
The “trouble” Lenin mentions was caused by the flight of S.
G.
Raichin (see Letter No.
49), who received money from abroad at Friedmann’s address without her permission.
In view of this the Minusinsk colony of exiles requested other exiles not to use Friedmann’s address so as to avoid drawing the attention of the police to her.
Letter No.
52 100Lenin was allowed to travel to Minusinsk to have his teeth treated; he stayed there three days, from the 10th to the 12th of August.
Since there was no experienced dentist in Minusinsk, Lenin ap-plied to the Governor of Yeniseisk for permission to go to Kras-noyarsk for a week to have his teeth treated.
Permission was grant-ed and at the beginning of September Lenin left Shushenskoye for Krasnoyarsk, where he stayed at the house of a Social-Democrat in exile, P.
A.
Krasikov.
Lenin took advantage of the trip to work in Yudin’s library and to meet Krasnoyarsk Social-Democrats.

Lenin made extensive use of the material contained in this article and the conclusions drawn from it in The Development of Capitalism in Russia.
The article was not published either in Mir Bozhy or Nauchnoye Obozreniye but first appeared in Economic Studies and Essays.
Mir Bozhy (The Wide World—literally God ’ s World)—a liberal literary and popular scientific monthly.
It was published in St.
Petersburg from 1892 to 1906; from 1906 to 1918 it appeared under the name of Sovremenny Mir (The Contemporary World).

60 112Stuttgart Parteitag—the Stuttgart Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party held October 3-8, 1898, which first discussed revisionism in the German Social-Democratic Party.
A special statement, sent to the congress by Eduard Bernstein who was living in exile, was read; it contained an exposition and defence of the opportunist views he had earlier expounded in Die Neue Zeit in a series of articles under the general heading of “Problems of Socialism”.
There was no unity among Bernstein’s opponents at the congress; fearing a split in the party, some of them, led by Bebel and Kautsky, tried to combine the theoretical struggle against Bernsteinism with cautious internal party practice; others (Rosa Luxemburg, Parvus), a minority, adopted a much more militant position and tried to get a more profound and extensive discussion and showed no fear of a split.
The congress did not pass any resolution on this issue but from the discussion and from other resolutions it was clear that most of the delegates remained loyal to the ideas of revolutionary Marxism.

Potresov sent his criticism of the article “The Heritage We Renounce” in a letter to Lenin; he said, in particular, that the article produced the impression that the author proposed accepting the heritage of Skaldin.
Lenin agreed in part with Potresov’s criticism but wrote in reply that he nowhere proposed accepting Skaldin’s heritage and had used his name and not that of Cherny-shevsky and his followers for reasons of censorship (see Collected Works, Vol.
34, pp.
28-29).

491-534).
Letter No.
76 142It has not been established with any degree of accuracy which addendum to Chapter VII of The Development of Capitalism in Russia Lenin was referring to.
It is quite possible that he referred to the footnote to the last paragraph but one of the chapter in which Lenin stated that Marx’s classification of the capitalist forms and stages of industry was more correct than that of Held and Bücher, which confuses the manufactory with the factory and regards working for a buyer-up as a special form of industry” (see Collected Works, Vol.
3, p.
549).

1 for 1899 (see Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.
55-64).
Struve’s article in reply to it, “Markets Under Capitalist Production (Apropos of Bulgakov’s Book and Ilyin’s Article)”, appeared in the same issue of the journal.
The market theory gave rise to a lively polemic in which A.
Iz-goyev, P.
Nezhdanov, B.
Avilov and P.
Skvortsov also participa-ted.
In No.
8 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye Lenin published another article, “Once More on the Theory of Realisation” (see Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.
74-93).
Struve delayed publication of this article, apparently in order to print his “ Answer to Ilyin” in the same issue.
The polemics on this problem continued—Zhizn No.
12 for 1899 carried P.
Nezhdanov’s article “The Polemics over the Market Question” and Lenin’s “Reply to Mr.
P.
Nezh-danov” (see Collected Works, Vol.

160-65).

77 146Die Neue Zeit was a journal published by the German Social-Dem-ocratic Party; although subscription to it was permitted in Russia it was frequently confiscated if addressed to a politically unreliable person.
For this reason Lenin referred to it in Russian (Novoye Vremya).
Lenin’s relatives had the journal sent to them in Moscow, and sent it on to Lenin in Shushenskoye.

This table was printed in the smallest available type, as Lenin requested.
Letter No.
78 149This refers to the table in the second section of Chapter II of The Development of Capitalism in Russia (First Edition) on the dis-tribution of allotment land among the various groups of house-holders and the table in the first section of that chapter illustrat-ing the ousting of the middle group of householders in the Dnieper Uyezd of Taurida Gubernia (see Collected Works, Vol.

Martov in Turukhansk but their correspon-dence during exile in Siberia has been lost.
Letter No.
83 160The event referred to was a student strike that took place in thirty higher educational establishments in St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, Kiev, Kharkov, Riga, Tomsk and other towns.
The disturbances in Finland were caused by the suspension ofthe Finnish Constitution on February 3 (15), 1899.
Evidently the censor inked over the reports of these events published in Frankfurter Zeitung.
Letter No.
83 161Lenin apparently made use of the journal Prakticheskaya Zhizn and I.
Tsion’s book Nigilisty i nigilizm to send letters in invis-ible ink.
Letter No.
85 162The article referred to is B.
Avilov’s “Novy opyt ‘ekonomicheskoi garmonii’ (N.
Kablukov, Ob usloviyakh razvitiya krestyanskogo khozyaistva v Rossii.
M.
, 1899), published in Nachalo No.
1-2 for 1899.
Letter No.
85 163Bulgakov’s article was “K voprosu o kapitalisticheskoi evolyutsii zemledeliya”, published in Nachalo Nos.
1-2 and 3 for 1899.
Letter No.
85 164Lenin made a critical analysis of the views of S.
N.
Bulgakov, the “legal Marxist”, in two articles under the common title of “Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr.
Bulgakov’s Article)”.
They were intended for publication in Nachalo but since that journal was banned they appeared in Nos.
1 and 2 of Zhizn for 1900 (see Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.
105-59).
The importance which Lenin attached to his articles against Bulgakov can be seen from his letter to A.
N.
Potresov of April 27, 1899 (Collected Works, Vol.
34, pp.
32-33), in which he expresses an exceedingly negative opinion of Bulgakov’s revisionist wri-tings.
Letter No.
85 165Lenin refers here to the proposed visit of his mother and sister Anna to Shushenskoye.
Letter No.
86 166The article “Capitalism in Agriculture” was published much later (in January and February 1900), when The Development of Capitalism in Russia had already appeared, so the references were not crossed out.
Letter No.
86 167Lenin began editing the second volume of the Webbs’ Industrial Democracy only at the beginning of September 1899.
In the course of this work he had not only to edit the translation but also to retranslate a considerable part of the text and write a number of footnotes.
The work was finished on January 19, 1900.
Letter No.
87 168P.
B.
Struve handed Lenin’s article “Once More on the Theory of Realisation” over to Nauchnoye Obozreniye because of the unstable position of Nachalo following the confiscation of the April 1899 issue.
Letter No.
87 169There was a remark in Bulgakov’s article “K voprosy o kapitaltsti-scheskoi evolyutsii zemledeliya” rejecting the Marxist theory of Zusammenbruch (socialist revolution).
Somewhat earlier Bernstein had made a similar criticism in his Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie, 1899 (the English translation was entitled Pro-blems of Socialism).
Letter No.
87 170No such remark was made at the end of the second part of “Capi-talism in Agriculture”.
It is possible that Lenin spoke of this in the first variant of his article; judging by Letters 98 and 99 he must have rewritten the article.
Letter No.
87 171Disciples—followers of Marx and Engels; this term was used in the nineties as a legally-permitted name for the Marxists.
Letter No.
88 172This refers to A.
Bogdanov’s Kratky kurs ekonomicheskoi nauki.
Letter No.
89 173The articles referred to are “A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism.
(Sismondi and Our Native Sismondists)” and “Reply to Mr.
P.
Nezhdanov”, the latter having been published in the December (No.
12) 1899 issue of Zhizn (see Collected Works, Letter No.
89 Vol.
2, pp.
129-315, and Vol.
4, pp.
160-66).
174Lenin refers to the following sentence from the first paragraph of his article “Reply to Mr.
P.
Nezhdanov”: “As far as the other questions are concerned, those raised by Mr.
P.
Nezhdanov in respect of the market theory and, in particular, of P.
B.
Struve’s views, I shall confine myself to a reference to my article in reply to Struve (‘Once More on the Theory of Realisation’; the delay in its publication in Nauchnoye Obozreniye was due to circum-stances over which the author had no control”) (see Collected Works, Vol.
4, p.
160).
Letter No.
89 175Lenin mentioned Tugan-Baranovsky’s article in a footnote to the last paragraph of his article “Uncritical Criticism” (Collected Works, Vol.
3, p.
632) and in a letter to A.
N.
Potresov dated June 27, 1899 (Collected Works, Vol.
34, p.
39).
Letter No.
90 176The review was that by G-d of A.
Bogdanov’s book Osnovniye elementy istoricheskogo vzglyada na prirodu.
It is not known whether Lenin wrote anything in reply to the review.
From his letter to Maxim Gorky, dated February 25, 1908 (Collected Works, Vol.
13, p.
448) we know that he had the book in Siberia.
It is known from a letter to A.
N.
Potresov, dated June 27, 1899, that Lenin at that time assumed that A.
Bogdanov was the pseu-donym of G.
V.
Plekhanov (see Collected Works, Vol.
34, p.
41).
Letter No.
90 177Lenin’s detailed analysis of the Credo appears to have been sent in a letter written in invisible ink.
Credo, or Creed, was the, name under which the programme or manifesto of the group of Economists, written by Y.
D.
Kus-kova, became known.
It was sent to Lenin in Shushenskoye by his sister Anna.
Lenin’s sister later recalled that she had received the Credo in St.
Petersburg from A.
M.
Kalmykova and “in the next letter in invisible ink to my brother, one of those written in books and journals, added this composition, rewritten in invisi-ble ink.
.
.
.
I gave the document the first name that came into my head and wrote ‘I am sending you some “Credo of the young”.
’” After having received the Credo Lenin wrote “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” which was discussed and adopted at a meeting of seventeen Marxists exiled to Minusinsk District Letter No.
92 (Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.
167-82).
178Lenin refers here to S.
Bulgakov’s article “Zakon prichinnosti i svoboda chelovecheskikh deistvii”, and P.
B.
Struve’s article “Ye-shcho o svobode i neobkhodimosti”, published in the May (No.
8) issue of Novoye Slovo for 1897.
The two articles are a continuation of the polemics between Struve and Bulgakov over the philosophy of Kant, Stammler, Zimmel and others in the journal Voprosy Filosofii i Psikhologii for 1896 and 1897.
Lenin spoke of Stammler in his “Uncritical Criticism” (Collected Works, Vol.
3, pp.
609-32) and also in a letter to A.
N.
Potresov dated June 27, 1899 (see Col-lected Works, Vol.
34, p.
40).
Letter No.
93 179This was P.
Skvortsov’s article “K voprosu o rynkakh (Po povodu zametki g.

96 181The Hanover Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party was held October 9-14, 1899.
The report on the chief item on the agenda—“The Attack on the Basic Views and Tactics of the Party”, was delivered by August Bebel.
Lenin wrote that this speech against the opportunists would “long remain as a model of the defence of Marxist views and of the struggle for the truly socialist character of the workers’ party” (Collected Works, Vol.
19, p.
300).
Although the congress opposed Bernstein’s revisionist views, it did not give an extensive criticism of Bernsteinism.
Letter No.

Letter No.
96 183The two articles mentioned, in which Lenin criticised the views of the liberal Narodnik N.
V.
Levitsky, have not been found.
They were apparently intended for Nachalo.
“About a Certain Newspaper Article” is the only article known to have been written by Lenin in the Siberian period about N.
Levitsky’s “O nekotorykhvoprosakh, kasayushchikhsya narodnoi zhizni” (Certain Problems Affecting the Life of the People) published in Russkiye Vedomosti on August 30, 1897 (see Collected Works, Vol.
2, pp.
316-22).
Letter No.
97 184Owing to the loss of the manuscript, it is impossible to say what corrections to his second article on “Capitalism in Agriculture” Lenin is referring to.
As can be seen by the next letter, he sent them long before the article was published.
Letter No.
98 185Sächsische Arbeiterzeitung (Saxon Workers’ Gazette)—a Social-Democratic daily published in Dresden from 1890.
From May 1, 1908 it was published as Dresdener Volkszeitung (Dresden Peoples Gazette).
An article by G.
V.
Plekhanov “Wofür sollen wir ihm dankbar sein< Offener Brief an Karl Kautsky” (What Should We Thank Him For? An Open Letter to Karl Kautsky) appeared in issues 253, 254 and 255; in this article Plekhanov criticised Bernstein sharply.
Bernstein polemised with Plekhanov over this article in a footnote to the last chapter of his Voraussetzungen des Sozialis-mus.
Letter No.
98 186The journal referred to was Le Mouvement Socialiste, a social and political journal that first appeared in Paris in January 1899.
It published a number of letters from Frederick Engels and arti-cles by him.
A number of the leaders of world Social-Democracy contributed to the journal, among them Wilhelm Liebknecht, Harry Quelch, Jean Jaurès, August Rebel and Rosa Luxemburg.
It also carried articles by the opportunists and revisionists that dominated the Second International.
Le Mouvement Socialiste went out of existence in June 1914.
Letter No.
100 187This booklet was apparently used by Lenin’s sister as the vehicle of a letter in invisible ink and Lenin’s statement that the “booklet on the professional congress in Moscow was very interesting and instructive” obviously refers to the contents of the letter.
Letter No.
100 188Severny Kuryer (Northern Courier)—a social, political and liter-ary daily that appeared in St.
Petersburg in 1899 and 1900.
Letter No.
100 189That same day, January 19, 1900, Nadezhda Krupskaya applied to the Yeniseisk Gubernia Council for permission to travel to Ufa at her own expense.
She did not receive it by the 29th and left Shushenskoye with Lenin.
She received her travel permit in Minusinsk.
The Knipovich family were close friends of Krupskaya’s.
Letter No.
101 190This refers to Lenin’s article “Uncritical Criticism (RegardingMr.
P.

It appeared at the end of January 1900.
Lenin wrote a review of this book (see Collected Works, Vol.
4, pp.
Letter No.
101 183-92).
192On March 10, 1900, Lenin applied to the Director of the Police Department for permission for Nadezhda Krupskaya to serve her term of police surveillance in Pskov instead of Ufa Gubernia.
The request was refused.
Letter No.
102 193Lenin’s second article “Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr.
Bulgakov’s Article)” was published in Zhizn No.
2 for 1900.
It is probable that this is the issue referred to in the letter.
Letter No.
102 194Lenin refers to P.
B.
Struve’s article “Osnovnaya antinomiya teorii trudovoi tsennosti” (The Basic Antinomy of the Theory of Labour Value) published in Zhizn No.

Lenin asked his mother to try to get permission in St.
Petersburg for him to go to Ufa to Krupskaya.
The permission was granted.

107 198Lenin’s journey to Podolsk was delayed.
On May 20, 1900 he went secretly to St.
Petersburg to meet local Social-Democrats and establish means of communication to be used after his leaving Russia.
On May 21 he was arrested for illegal entry into the capi-tal.
He was released on May 31 and was dispatched to Podolsk in the company of a police official, arriving on June 1.
Letter No.
108199Lenin intended going to Siberia to see G.

On June 10, 1900 he returned to Podolsk from Ufa and on July 16 went abroad to organise the Letter No.
109 all-Russia illegal newspaper Iskra (The Spark).
200Lenin did not live in Paris in 1900, and if he went there at all it was only for a short time; for purposes of secrecy he sent letters to Russia through Paris.
Letter No.
110 201This was said for the sake of secrecy.
Early in September 1900 Lenin actually went to Nuremberg on his way to Munich for talks with the German Social-Democrat A.
Braun about organisa-tional and technical assistance in publishing Iskra.

150 234Krupskaya recalls the following in connection with this holiday.
“At the end of June 1904, Vladimir Ilyich and I took our ruck-sacks and set off for a month in the mountains, following our noses.
We spent a week or so in Lausanne to muster a little strength, and then set out for somewhere beyond Montreux; we found our way through the wildest forests to a place where some loggers told us how to reach the road and where to spend the night.
Through Aigle we descended into the valley of the Rhone, went to Bex-les-Bains to an old school and college friend of mine, and then wandered along the Rhone for a long time—about 70 versts; this was the most tiring part of the journey.
In the end we crossed the Gemmi Pass into Oberland, reached the foot of the Jungfrau, and then, with our legs aching and completely worn out, we stayed at Iseltwald on the Brienzersee for about a week and from there again took to the road through Interlaken and Zimmental back to the Geneva area.
The winter of 1903-04 had been a particularly difficult one, our nerves were in a bad state and we wanted to get away from people and forget for the time being all business and alarms.
The mountains helped us.
The changing impressions, the mountain air, solitude, healthy tiredness and healthy sleep were a real cure for Vladimir Ilyich.
His strength and vivacity and high spirits returned to him.
In August we lived on Lac de Bret, where Vladimir Ilyich and Bogdanov evolved a plan for the further struggle against the Mensheviks.
” Letter No.
151 235This refers to Hobson’s Imperialism, published in 1902.
There is no printed edition of Lenin’s translation of the book in exist-ence and the manuscript of the translation has been lost.

Letter No.
158 241After the defeat of the First Russian Revolution, Lenin was hunted by the tsarist police and had to leave Kuokkala in November 1907 and move to Oggelby (near Helsingfors).
In accordance with the decision of the Bolshevik centre to transfer the publication of the newspaper Proletary to Geneva, Lenin left Oggelby.
He stayed in Stockholm for a few days and arrived in Geneva on January 7, 1908.
This was his second period of exile abroad, which lasted until April 1917.

158 243The article referred to is Lenin’s “The Agrarian Question in Rus-sia Towards the Close of the Nineteenth Century”, which he wrote for the Granat Brothers Encyclopaedic Dictionary.
Because of the censorship the article could not be published at that time.
It first appeared in 1918 in pamphlet form (see Collected Works, Letter No.
158 Vol.
15, pp.
69-147).
244Rech (Speech)—organ of the Constitutional-Democratic (Cadet) Party published daily in St.

29-39).
246The club referred to is the Société de lecture (Reading Society) in Geneva; to work in the reading-room it was necessary to be a member of it and pay a certain fee.
Lenin had worked there in Letter No.

247Zerno (Grain or The Seed) was a publishing house headed by M.
S.
Kedrov; in 1907 it launched the publication of a collection of Lenin’s works under the general title of Twelve Years.
It was planned as a three-volume edition but only the first volume and Part I of the second appeared.
Volume I appeared in November 1907 (the date on the cover was 1908) and was confiscated soon after its appearance, although a large part of this first printing was saved and was distributed illegally.
Zerno published a symposium on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Marx’s death and the Kalendar dlya vsekh (Calendar for All) for 1908, which carried Lenin’s article “The International Social-ist Congress in Stuttgart” (see Collected Works, Vol.
13, pp.

Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy the word “fideism” was used instead of popovshchina, a derogatory Russian term for “clericalism”, although “popovshchina” remained unchanged in a number of places.
Lenin also suggested changing the word to “Shamanism”; his sister Anna, in a letter dated January 27, 1909, replied by saying, “‘Shamanism’ has come too late.
Anyway, is it any better?” The explanatory note was given in the Preface to the first and subsequent editions (see Collected Works, Vol.

Apparently it refers to Section 1 of Chapter Two, “The ‘ Thing-in-Itself ’ or V.

, and also representatives of the St.
Petersburg, Moscow Regional and Urals organisations.
The conference proceeded under Lenin’s guidance and his speeches on all the main points on the agenda shaped the character of the conference.
The theses put forward by Lenin formed the basis of the decisions adopted by the con-ference.
The conference roundly condemned otzovism and ultimatumism as harmful and dangerous trends in the working-class movement.
A.
Bogdanov, leader and inspirer of the otzovists, ultimatumists and God-builders, was expelled from the Bolshevik group.

The “interview” of which Lenin writes was published on November 17 under the heading “The Excommunication of Maxim Gorky”.
This libellous account was taken up by Rech and other bourgeois papers, Russian and foreign.

The newspaper Nevskaya Zvezda was a direct continuation of Zvezda and was launched because of the frequent confiscation of the latter.
These newspapers published about 50 of Lenin’s arti-cles.
Zvezda enjoyed great prestige among factory and other work-ers in Russia; it prepared the way for Pravda, the Bolshevik mass legal newspaper.
Mysl (Thought)—a legal Bolshevik monthly dealing with phi-losophical, economic and social problems; it was published in Moscow from December 1910 to April 1911—five issues in all.

231315Pravda (The Truth)—the legal Bolshevik daily that was laun-ched in St.
Petersburg on April 22 (May 5), 1912.
Pravda was under Lenin’s ideological guidance; he wrote for it almost daily and sent instructions to the editors.
Some 270 articles by Lenin were published in Pravda; Gorky, too, published his stories in Pravda.
The newspaper was suppressed by the tsarist authorities eight times but continued to appear under changed names—Rabochaya Pravda, Severnaya Pravda, Pravda Truda, Za Pravdu, Proletar-skaya Pravda, Put Pravdy, Rabochy, Trudovaya Pravda (Work-ers’ Truth, Northern Truth, Truth of Labour, For Truth, Proleta-rian Truth, The Path of Truth, The Worker, Labour Truth).
Under these difficult conditions the Bolsheviks succeeded in publishing 636 issues of Pravda in a little over two years.
On July 8 (21), 1914, the newspaper was finally suppressed and did not re-appear until the February bourgeois-democratic revolution, in 1917.

Lenin’s letter has been lost but its contents are known from a letter written by his mother to her daughter Maria on April 30, 1913.
“I have just received a letter from Volodya in which he also wrote to Mitya to inform him that in spite of electric treatment for three weeks, Nadya’s eyes, neck and heart are no better.

Acquaintances advise him to take her to Kocher in Berne, a first-class specialist on such illnesses—it can be cured, they say, but it is dangerous to neglect it, the illness is a serious one and later it will become hopeless.

Volodya is in great difficulty—should they abandon the cottage they have now moved to, which is on a mountain, and there is the excellent mountain air she was told was good forher, or take her to Kocher, who is a surgeon and will probably want to operate; many people say that operations in such cases are difficult and the outcome is doubtful.

Its circulation reached 5,000 Copies.
The journal was founded on Lenin’s initiative in place of the Bolshevik, journal Mysl, formerly published in Moscow and sup-pressed by the authorities.
On the eve of the First World War Prosveshcheniye was pro-hibited by the tsarist government.
In the autumn of 1917 the journal was restarted, but only one issue (a double number) ap-peared; it contained two articles by Lenin, “Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?” and “The Revision of the Party Program-me”.

The Bolsheviks put forward a list of candidates for election that had been published in Pravda No.

Despite the insistence on the part of the liquidators to elect candidates irrespective of political allegiance, the majority of those present voted for the Pravda list; 10 out of 14 members of the Executive were elected from the Bolshevik list.
The newly elected Executive sent a telegram to Lenin greeting him as “the true leader of the working class”.

242 323In September 1913, four volumes of the Marx-Engels correspon-dence were published in German.
Lenin planned a big work about this correspondence, the beginning of which was his article “The Marx-Engels Correspondence” (see Collected Works, Vol.

247 327The book August Bebel.
His Life and Work.
1840-1913 was written by V.
Levitsky (V.
O.
Zederbaum) and reviewed in the journal Prosveshcheniye No.
1 for 1914 by V.
Yan-sky (S.
S.
Danilov).
Letter No.
247 328This refers to the journal Rabotnitsa (The Working Woman)published legally in St.
Petersburg from February 23 to June 28, 1914.
The first, issue appeared on International Women’s Day, February 23 (March 8).
Seven issues appeared.
Active collaborators were Nadezhda Krupskaya, Inessa Armand, Lyudmila Stal, Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova and others.
Further information about the publication of the journal is to be found in Krupskaya’s letter (No.
48) to Lenin’s sister Anna.
Letter No.
247 329This refers to Lenin’s lecture on the question of nationalities de-livered in the Grand Hall of the Paris Geographical Society on January 23, 1914.
Letter No.
248 330The Beilis affair—the trial of the Jew Beilis organised by the tsarist authorities in Kiev in 1913 for purposes of provocation; Beilis was falsely accused of the ritual murder of the Christian boy Yushchinsky (the boy was actually killed by the Black Hun-dreds).
By staging this trial the tsarist authorities hoped to arouse anti-Semitic feelings and by means of anti-Jewish pogroms divert the masses from the revolutionary movement that was devel-oping in the country.
The trial aroused tremendous social unrest; in many towns there were workers’ protest demonstrations.
Beilis was acquitted by the court.
Letter No.
250 331Lenin and Krupskaya attended the celebrations in honour of the centenary of Shevchenko’s birth.
Letter No.
250 332In Prosveshcheniye No.
11 (1913) there was a short article by Mikhail Sadko on “Who Is Being Exiled?” There were no other articles on the subject in the journal.
Letter No.
252 333On August 7, 1914 Lenin’s apartment in Poronin was searched by the Austrian authorities on receipt of false information accus-ing him of espionage.
Lenin was ordered to report to the gendar-merie in the district town of Novy Targ, where he was arrested and imprisoned next day.
Polish Social-Democrats and members of the Austrian Parlia-ment came to Lenin’s defence and he was released on August 19.
He obtained permission to leave Austria for neutral Switzer-land, arriving there on September 5, 1914.
Letter No.
253 334This refers to Lenin’s article “Karl Marx (A Brief Biographical Sketch with an Exposition of Marxism)”, written between July and November 1914 for Granat’s Encyclopaedic Dictionary.
An abridged version of the article, signed V.
Ilyin, was published in 1915 in Volume 28 of the dictionary.
It was first published in full in 1925 in Marx, Engels, Marxism (see Collected Works, Vol.
Letter No.
253 21, pp.
43-91).
335Lenin’s fears were fully justified.
After he had left, the greater part of his books and papers fell into the hands of the gendarme-rie and were passed on to the General Staff in Warsaw.
In 1954 some of this material was discovered in Poland and sent to the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.
P.
S.
U.
and part of the documents has been included in the Collected Works.
Letter No.
253 336During the First World War G.
V.
Plekhanov adopted a social-chauvinist stand by defending the Menshevik tactics of defencism; this met with favourable comments in the bourgeois press.
Letter No.
253 337The journal referred to is Prosveshcheniye, publication of which was to be resumed.
In a letter to her sister Maria on April 11, 1915, Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova wrote that it was intended to issue one or two numbers of the journal in summer.
In a letter dated April 23, she wrote: “We shall speak about restarting the journal, or rather, of publishing a summer issue, so as not to lose the right to publish it, but so far we have not got down to it.
Volodya simp-ly thirsts for a journal and a newspaper of our own.
” Letter No.
253 338In Sovremenny Mir No.
9 for 1914 there appeared an ultra-chauv-inist article by N.
Iordansky entitled “Let There Be Victory!”.
Letter No.
253 339Lenin’s sister Maria asked him to try to get information about a prisoner of war, A.
Rosenfeldt.
In a letter to V.
A.
Karpinsky in January 1915 Lenin asked whether there was a bureau in Ge-neva giving information on Russian prisoners of war in Ger-many.
Letter No.
254 340Lenin here refers to the split in the German Social-Democratic Party between the majority, the opportunist Centrists who followed Kautsky, and the radical Left wing.
Letter No.
255 341Lichtstrahlen (Rays of Light)—a monthly journal published by Left Social-Democrats (the International Socialists of Germany) under the editorship of J.
Borhardt.
It was published irregularly from 1913 to 1921 in Berlin.
Letter No.
255 342Early in June 1915 Lenin and Krupskaya had left Berne for the mountain village of Sörenberg, where they spent the summer.
Letter No.
256 343The letter has been lost.
Lenin was looking for a publisher for his book New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture.
Part One.
Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America, written in 1915 (see Collected Works, Vol.
22, pp.
13-102).
It was probably about this book that Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova wrote to her sister Maria on February 27, 1915; “Thanks for trying to find someone for Volodya’s book—because of this I shall postpone the conclusion of an agreement with Bonch (he offers 50 rubles a signature for 3,000 copies).
” Lenin began his study of U.
S.
farming statistics much earlier, as can be seen from his letters to the New York economist I.
A.
Hourwich on February 27 and to N.
N.
Nakoryakov on May 18, 1914.
When Lenin finished work on the book at the end of 1915 he sent the MS to Gorky in Petrograd for the Parus Publishing House (see Collected Works, Vol.
35, p.
212).
It was eventually published in pamphlet form in 1917 by the Zhizn i Znaniye Publishers.
Letter No.
256 344It was later revealed that the information given concerned another man of the same name; A.
Rosenfeldt, in whom the Ulyanovs were interested, had been killed at the front.
Letter No.
257 345On February 21, 1916, Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova wrote this to her sister Maria: “I have had a letter from Nadya who writes that their landlady drove them to desperation; they went all over the place but could not find another room anywhere, then hit upon the idea of going to Zürich for a couple of weeks to work in the local libraries.
She wrote about this trip and the little shake-up as of something pleasurable.
” Krupskaya’s letter has been lost.
Letter No.
257 346Lenin wrote about his sister Anna’s illness for reasons of secrecy; actually she had been arrested on July 21, 1916.
She was released in October and banished to Astrakhan Gubernia; since she was really ill, however, she was allowed to remain in Petrograd; dur-ing the winter her house was twice searched but nothing was found.
In February 1917 she was again arrested although nothing was found on this occasion either; a few days later she was released by the revolutionary people.
Letter No.
259 347The book referred to was Lenin’s Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism which he wrote in the first half of 1916 and on July 2 sent via Paris to Parus Publishers in Petrograd; on Gorky’s initiative this publishing house put out a series of popular booklets on the countries of Western Europe during the First World War.
The series was edited by M.
N.
Pokrovsky, who was in Paris at the time, and through him Lenin maintained contact with the publishers.
The manuscript did not reach Pokrovsky and a second copy had to he sent.
In September 1916 Gorky wrote to Pokrovsky saying, “Lenin is really magnificent”.
The Parus editors, however, protested strongly against Lenin’s criticism of Kautsky’s apos-tasy and made some substantial changes to the text—they removed the criticism of Kautsky’s theory of ultra-imperialism and dis-torted several of Lenin’s formulations.
Lenin’s book was first published in Petrograd in mid-1917 under the title Imperialism, the Latest Stage of Capitalism.
(A Popular Outline) with a Preface by Lenin dated April 26, 1917.
Letter No.
260348New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture.
Part One.
Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America is the full title of the part published.
Lenin intended writing two further parts—on Germany and Austria— and started collecting material.
During a search of his house at Poronin on August 7, 1914 three notebooks containing statistical analyses on the agricultural systems of Germany, Austria and Hungary were seized.
The Central Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, C.
C.
, C.
P.
S.
U.
, is in possession of some of the material prepared by Lenin for the next part (on Germany).
Lenin was unable to carry out his intention of writing Part Two, Germany.
Letter No.
260 349Enclosed with the letter was a plan of this work drawn up by Nadezhda Krupskaya.
Latter No.
263 350Lenin refers here to his book The State and Revolution.
The Marx-ist Theory of the State and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revo-lution, on which he was working in August and September 1917 when in hiding (at Razliv and in Helsingfors) (see Collected Works, Vol.
25, pp.
385-497).
Letter No.
265 351Lenin recommended these books to his sister Maria because she intended writing a book on the British working-class movement.
Letter No.
266 352At this time Krupskaya was on board the government propaganda vessel Krasnaya Zvezda as representative of the People’s Com-missariat of Education.
Propagandists and representatives of a number of People’s Commissariats were on board the vessel which sailed from Nizhny Novgorod to Perm, stopping at towns and villages, factories and factory settlements.
Krupskaya kept a detailed diary of the voyage.
The telegram from V.
M.
Pozner which Lenin mentions ran as follows: “The Provisional Executive Committee of the Union of Workers in Education and Socialist Culture has to inform you that the Second All-Russia Communist Conference opens on July 25, two days prior to the opening of the congress appointed for July 27 by a decision of the second session.
The Executive Com-mittee requests you to speak on ‘The New Personnel in Educa-tion and Work Among the People’.
Please inform us of your cons-ent.
” Telegram No.
2 6 7 353Krupskaya has the following to say about her correspondence with Lenin: “The letter of July 9, 1919 is the only private letter from Vladimir Ilyich that I still have.
We did not live much apart.
We carried on a considerable correspondence when Ilyich was in prison and during his first year of exile, when he was alone, also during my stay in Ufa.
In those days we wrote mostly in invis-ible ink and letters were destroyed as soon as they had been read.
In 1919 I travelled on the propaganda vessel Krasnaya Zvezda for about two months.
It was difficult to correspond in this period because of the constant movement of the vessel.
But even those few letters I received from Ilyich were all, except one, destroyed, following the habit of underground work acquired in the past.
” Another letter and a telegram sent by Lenin to the propaganda ship were discovered later (see Letter No.
270 and Telegram No.
269).
Letter No.
268 354Lenin here refers to Gorki, near Moscow, where he spent any leisure time he had.
Lenin first went there on September 24 or 25, 1918.
At first he spent his days off there but later, on the insistence of his doctors, he lived there for some time, although even during this period of rest he continued working hard.
Towards the end of 1921 Lenin’s health deteriorated seriously.
On December 6 he was granted leave of absence and spent the time in Gorki.
During his illness (May 23-October 2, 1922) he lived in Gorki and went there on a visit for a few days in early Decem-ber.
From May 15, 1923 to his death on January 21, 1924, Lenin lived in Gorki, leaving there only on rare occasions.
The place is now called Gorki Leninskiye and a Lenin Museum was opened there on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death.
Letter No.
268 355This telegram is in answer to the following telegram from Krup-skaya: “Moscow, Comrade Lenin.
July 10, 1919.
Kazan.
Arrived in Kazan today.
Am well.
Very much work.
Am moving on.
Are you keeping well? Ulyanova.
