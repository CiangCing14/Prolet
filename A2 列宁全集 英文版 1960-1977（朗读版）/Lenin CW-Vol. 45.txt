TO COMRADE STALIN .
March 5 607 607 608 609 759PREFACE Volume 45 contains letters, notes, telegrams and tele-phone messages written from November 1920 to March 1923.
They are connected with Lenin’s works which make up volumes 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36 of the present edition, and largely supplement them.
These documents cover the new historical period in the life of the Soviet state which began after the rout of the foreign armed intervention and domestic counter-revolution, a period of peaceful socialist construction.
This had to be carried on in the midst of economic dis-location, a shortage of food and a lack of fuel.
The inter-national situation was also complicated.
The imperialists did their utmost in hampering the Soviet people’s effort to heal the economic wounds and to establish ties with other countries.
Faced with these serious internal and ex-ternal political difficulties, Lenin did a vast amount of work in guiding the Communist Party and the Soviet state, socialist construction and foreign policy, charting the ways of transition from “War Communism” to the New Econom-ic Policy (NEP), and directing the implementation of the measures mapped out by the Party to put NEP through.
A number of letters set out major propositions on the substance and importance of NEP, which, Lenin said, should be viewed in the context of the general tasks and pros-pects of socialist construction, and in the light of the GOELRO plan, which was designed to lay the economic foundation of the new society.
He wrote that the “New Economic Policy does not change the single state economic plan, and does not go beyond its framework, but alters the approach to its realisation” (present edition, Vol.
35, p.
530).
The principal task of NEP was to ensure a strong al-liance between the working class and the peasantry, as the highest principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the basis of the Soviet power.
Socialist construction could not be a success unless all the toiling peasantry was involved.
Elaborating NEP, Lenin marked out the concrete forms of the link-up between town and country, and the ways of rehabilitating all the branches of the national economy, and laying the foundation of a socialist society.
Lenin tackled this intricate task after making a thorough analysis of the political and economic state of the country, and a deep study of the state of the peasant economy.
This volume contains a record of Lenin’s talks with the peasants I.
A.
Chekunov and A.
R.
Shaposhnikov, and shows his concern for boosting agriculture.
Thus, in a letter to I.
A.
Teodorovich, Lenin says that the combating of the drought was a great task before the whole state (see p.
134 of this vol--ume).
It was he who initiated the decree of the Council of Labour and Defence (C.
L.
D.
) recognising the efforts to combat the drought as “an undertaking of primary impor-tance for the country’s agricultural life, and measures taken in that direction, as being of great urgency”.
The documents contained in this volume shed light on the activity of Lenin, the Party and the Government in rehabilitating industry and transport, normalising the oper-ation of the Donets coal-fields (Donbas), developing metal-lurgy, etc.
They also show Lenin’s concern for implement-ing the GOELRO plan, and his handling of various mat-ters arising from the construction of the Kashira, Volkhov and other electric-power stations.
Many of Lenin’s telegrams and notes contain instructions for providing these early projects in the Soviet electrification drive with the neces-sary materials, equipment and foodstuffs.
One of the most complicated tasks in the first year of NEP was establishing normal economic ties and starting an exchange of goods between industry and agriculture.
The documents in this volume reveal Lenin’s role in solving the tasks of developing domestic and foreign trade, and creating a stable financial and monetary system on that basis.
He wrote: “The important, the most important, the basic task is to make a practical start on this.
” It is the onlyway to transform NEP into “a base for socialism, a base which, this being a peasant country, no power on earth can vanquish” (pp.
446, 477).
Lenin gave concrete instructions on measures to develop trade, called for information on the growth of trade, espe-cially in the countryside, and welcomed the successes-of the co-operative movement.
He devoted much attention to matters of financial policy, the need for regular stock-taking of commodities throughout the state, kept an eye on the state of the gold reserve, and urged its sparing use.
The crop failure of 1921 brought about starvation for millions of people in the country, especially in the Volga area.
One of the urgent tasks of the Soviet state was to organise famine relief.
Documents in this volume reflect the main measures taken by the Party and the Government to muster and correctly distribute the domestic foodstuff resources, create a stock of goods to be exchanged for grain, improve the supply of food from the grain-rich gubernias, and the purchase of foodstuffs abroad.
The Soviet Government resolutely opposed every attempt on the part of world imperialism to make use of the famine to put political pressure to bear on the Soviet Republic, and Lenin’s letters show him exposing these imperialist manoeuvres.
In a letter to the members of the Political Bureau, he wrote: “This game is an extremely intricate one.
There is rank duplicity on the part of America, Hoover and the League of Nations Council” (p.
250).
Lenin devoted a great deal of attention to the working-class movement in the capitalist countries to provide assistance to the starving people of Russia.
A large section of the material deals with efforts to over-come the fuel crisis.
Lenin headed the C.
L.
D.
’s fuel com-mission, which took a number of urgent steps to increase the extraction of coal and oil, and to extend hydraulic peat-digging and firewood cutting.
The transition to NEP called for a restructuring of economic management, strict practice of the principle of democratic centralism, improvement in planning, develop-ment of local initiative, extension of the rights of enter-prises, introduction of material incentives and economicaccounting, and operation of enterprises at a profit.
All these matters are dealt with extensively in Lenin’s letters.
The documents testify to Lenin’s great emphasis on the organisation and style of work in Party, government and economic establishments, improvement of the state appa-ratus, reduction of staffs and running costs, and introduc-tion of scientific principles in all its work.
Lenin urged that a struggle against bureaucracy and red tape should be conducted “in a business-like manner, according to all the rules of warfare”.
Lenin insisted that malicious bureaucrats should be subjected to strict administrative penalties, removed from their posts and put on trial.
Lenin repeatedly stressed that everything depended not on institutions, but on people and the verification of practical experience.
He called for the strict practice of the principle of col-lective leadership, observance of Party and state disci-pline, with personal responsibility for assignments.
Lenin himself never adopted any decisions alone on matters which were subject to collective discussion, and took counsel with the members of the Party’s Central Committee, the Peo-ple’s Commissars, and other leading workers on all matters of any importance.
Lenin marked out a programme for reconstructing the government and economic apparatus in his “Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence to Local Soviet Bodies”.
A number of documents show the thoroughness with which Lenin prepared the Instructions, the draft of which was widely discussed.
Lenin devoted exceptional attention to the correct selection and appointment of personnel.
This is clearly seen from his letter to Y.
M.
Yaroslavsky of December 24, 1921, concerning a prospective candidate for the post of People’s Commissar for Agriculture.
Lenin asked him to obtain answers to the following questions as regards this comrade: “Age? Experience? Respect of peasantry? Knowledge of economics? Strength of mind? Brains? Loyalty to the Soviet power?” (pp.
419-20).
Lenin valued vigorous men, who had knowl-edge and displayed initiative.
He sharply condemned “administration by fiat”, the ordering of people about, and rudeness to colleagues and subordinates; he fought againstformalism, red tape, lack of punctuality, rashness and undue haste.
The Communist Party was implementing the programme of the country’s transformation on socialist lines in sharp struggle against all sorts of oppositionists who were trying to undermine the unity of the Party’s ranks.
Lenin opposed everyone who tried to distort or to cast doubt on the cor-rectness of the path charted by the Party.
He believed it was necessary to give a resolute rebuff to bourgeois ideolo-gists, Right-wing socialists and Mensheviks, who distorted the New Economic Policy of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and to the Left-wing opportunists, who took the wrong view of NEP, notably of the role of “state capi-talism” under the dictatorship of the working class.
Lenin emphasised that “state capitalism in a state with proletar-ian power can exist only as limited in time and sphere of extension, and conditions of its application, mode of supervision over it, etc.
” (p.
444).
An important part of the volume consists of material dealing with the development of culture, science and tech-nology, which Lenin viewed in the context of the country’s economic construction tasks.
He called attention to the need to co-ordinate the work of inventors throughout the whole country, and proposed regular procedures for exam-ining and recording reported inventions.
Of great interest is his letter entitled “To the Inventions Section of the Scien-tific and Technical Department of the Supreme Economic Council”, which set before this body a number of concrete tasks in organising its work (pp.
50-51).
These documents show Lenin’s vigorous support for every scientific discov-ery and technical improvement whose application in prac-tice he believed to be an important factor in raising labour productivity.
He attached great importance to the regular flow of information on scientific and technical achievements abroad, and the use in this country of the best foreign technical experience.
A number of letters and notes in this volume deal with improving the work of the People’s Commissariat for Education, and secondary and higher schools, the wiping out of illiteracy, and other cultural problems (protection of art values, publication of a dictionary of modern Russianand a school atlas).
Lenin supported the realistic trend in art, and warned artists against being carried away by futurism.
In a letter to M.
N.
Pokrovsky, Lenin wrote: “I request you to help us fight futurism, etc.
.
.
.
Could you find some reliable anti-futurists?” (p.
139).
In the NEP period, with some growth of the capitalist elements, the Party’s ideological, political and educational work, the propaganda of Marxism and resolute struggle against bourgeois ideology had an especially big role to play.
Great importance attaches to Lenin’s instructions on developing the social sciences.
He proposed collecting all the published works and photostatic copies of documents of the founders of Marxism, and this helped to set up the Marx and Engels Institute; he edited a collection of their selected letters, and made remarks on Béla Kun’s pam-phlet, From Revolution to Revolution (p.
66), which are of fundamental importance to historical science.
Socialist construction is inseparably bound up with the correct solution of the national question.
Lenin’s correspondence reveals his guidance in the implementa-tion of the national policy.
Lenin advised Communists in the non-Russian republics to take account of local conditions and specifics in effecting NEP in the construc-tion of socialism.
He said the correct solution of the nation-al question in the Soviet East was of tremendous impor-tance, and wrote: “This is a world-wide question, and that is no exaggeration.
There you must be especially strict.
It will have an effect on India and the East; it is no joke, it calls for exceptional caution” (p.
298).
A number of documents reflect Lenin’s concern for all the peoples of the Land of Soviets, for their unity, friendship and co-operation, and his resolute struggle against Great-Power chauvinism and local nationalism.
A major question dealt with in this volume is the foreign policy activity of the Soviet state: the work of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, preparations for the Genoa Conference, establishment of relations with various countries, extension of trade between the Soviet Republic and capitalist states, and negotiations on concessions.
The documents reflect the Soviet Government’s steadfast strug-gle to implement its peaceable foreign policy, basing it-self on the principles of peaceful coexistence, and working to establish business relations with all countries.
Some documents show Lenin’s resolute defence of the foreign trade monopoly.
He warned against the possibility of another armed intervention by the foreign imperialists against the Soviet state.
In view of such a danger, he wrote to G.
V.
Chicherin in October 1921 that “nothing can be done to pre-vent this except strengthening our defence capacity” (p.
355).
Lenin devoted much attention to the establishment of friendly relations with the countries of the East.
The treaties of peace and friendship concluded in 1921 between Soviet Russia, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey offered exam-ples of good interstate relations based on trust and mutual respect.
A number of letters deal with the international com-munist and working-class movement.
The documents show that Lenin was consistent in working to strengthen the Communist Parties, the monolithic unity of their ranks, the unity of the international communist movement, and the practice of the principle of proletarian internationalism.
In several letters and notes he makes some important pro-positions on the activity of the Communist International and the Red International of Trade Unions.
A large part of the documents are biographic; many letters and notes show Lenin’s exceptional modesty, his touching concern for his comrades, the health and living conditions of Party and government workers and leaders of the international communist movement.

Perhaps we could establish the following order concern-ing the number of workers’ supply rations: 1) Establish the minimum number of rations in numeri-cal order, say: ration No.
1 ordinary, minimum No.
2 so much higher ” No.
3 ” .

.
.
.
.
.

etc.
, up to No.
10, the highest ration, if the total number of rations could be confined to 10.
2) Determine monthly how many consumers (industrial or office workers plus members of their families) are receiving under each ration.
If we managed to do this, we could first find out exactly how many ration groups there are; Second, we could easily switch separate groups from one ration to another; And third, we should always know how much has actually been issued and to how many workers.

1920 From Mosalsk Uyezd, Kaluga Gubernia.
1) At first requisition is said to have been in live cattle— this caused extreme dissatisfaction among the peasants.
It was even said that they “were being robbed”.
Later (in X.
1920) the requisition is said to have been switched from live cattle to meat (13 pounds per cow, 26 pounds per pig, 7 pounds per sheep, etc.
).
The peasants were highly satisfied with this change.
The requisition is now said to be again in live cattle: there is again dissatisfaction and bitterness among the peasants.
2) The former Baryatinsky estate (later owned by a Ger-man, something like Schalart) in Silkovo Volost, probably more than 1,000 dessiatines.
This has been taken over for a state farm, the land is lying waste, millions are said to be taken from the treasury, no more than 5 dessiatines ploughed up in 1920.
Ten (out of about 100) horses and 30-40 (out of 200) cows remain.
No one is working hard.
The furniture has been pilfered, etc.
The peasants in the neighbourhood are very much in need of land and are highly disgruntled at not being given either meadow or land.
(Nikolai Semyonovich Bodyakov, Silkovo Volost, the vil-lage of Filipkovo, Mosalsk Uyezd, Kaluga Gubernia.
) I request Comrades Bryukhanov and Sereda to order a report and to let me have it, within two days, at the latest.
Can these needs be met? Or is there some obstacle? 11 Lenin First published in 1 9 4 2 in Lenin Miscellany XXXIV Printed from the original 11 TO V.

CHICHERIN Comrade Chicherin, The news from Britain, especially from Krasin (and extracts from the newspapers), and particularly the news that America will at once join (a trade agreement between Russia and Britain) raises the urgent and extremely impor-tant issue of a trade agreement with Britain.
12 If it is a question of peace or war, * it should be tied in with Batum and Georgia.
13 Then, on the question of debts, we should be absolutely sure that we are not made to pay.
If there is a trade agreement who will have the right to sign the final text? Krasin alone? or the Council of People’s Commissars? This question must be urgently worked out in all its aspects.

You failed to protest the decision in the C.

How the People’s Commis-sariat for Foreign Affairs can hope to “get it going” con-trary to the Council of People’s Commissars is inconceiv-able.
This is chaos and disorganisation.

LUNACHARSKY Copies to Comrades Litkens, Solovyov, Krestinsky 29/XI.
Comrade Lunacharsky: Comrade Litkens and I had a detailed talk yesterday.
I find his and Comrade Solovyov’s drafts artificial.
21 Naturally, the C.
C.
will decide.
My own preliminary considerations are as follows: 1) Set up the office of Assistant People’s Commissar to handle all the administrative side.
2) Turn the “organisational sector” into an “organisa-tional centre” (with a member of the collegium in charge).
This centre is to handle the administrative, organisational, supply and other sides of all the sectors.
3) Eliminate Glavprofobr * , merging it with the secon-dary schools, provided: (α) general knowledge and political subjects are extended in the secondary schools and (β ) the switch from trade and technical to polytechnical education is, as far as possible, ensured.
4) Revive the “G.
U.
S.
” (State Academic Council) and regulate it as an organ for discussion of all scientific and pedagogical matters.
* The Central Administration for Vocational Training under the People’s Commissariat for Education.
—Ed.
Composition=all members of the collegium&the best specialists, even if bourgeois.
5) Set up the following sectors: (1) pre-school; (2) primary school; (3) secondary school (= Glavprofobr); (4) extra-mural (= Chief Committee for Political Education); (5) higher school; (6) art.
6) Leave the art sector as a single one, appointing “political commissars” from among the Communists to all central and governing bodies in the sector.

CHUTSKAYEV Comrade Chutskayev Commission for Abolishing Cash Taxes 22 More thought must be given to the conditions of the transition epoch (and the relevant facts studied in greater detail).
There is no doubt about switching from money to the exchange of products without money.
To make the switch a success, there must be an exchange of products (not exchange of commodities).
So long as we are unable to carry on the exchange of commodities, i.
e.
, to give the peasants industrial products, the peasantry has to make do with the remnants of com-modity (and consequently of money) circulation, with a substitute for it.
It is economically wrong to abolish the substitute (money) before the peasantry has been given that which eliminates the need of a substitute.
This must be given very serious thought.

1920 Comrade Tsyurupa: I have already had occasion to point out in the Council of People’s Commissars that the organisation of work at the Distribution Department of the Commissariat for Food is not entirely satisfactory: they have failed to make a serious estimate of how many rations we have and how many persons are receiving under each ration.
They must be made to do this.
Of course, there must be no disruption of the special pur-pose supply.
The workers must come first.
Do you think it possible to set up a commission inside the Commissariat for Food to make improvements in this respect? If there is a commission, give it such an assignment.
More workers (from the trade unions) who had worked in the Commissariat for Food (or possibly from among those workers who have some experience in food supply work locally) should be recruited to the commission.
Show this letter to Comrade Krestinsky.
If he gives his own consent (and that of the other members of the Polit-bureau) we shall make this a C.
C.
directive.
Yours, Lenin First published in 1 9 4 2 in Lenin Miscellany XXXIV Printed from the original 24 TO A.

TSYURUPA Dear Comrade Tsyurupa: The Plenary Meeting decision is the result of long and old dissatisfactions with Svidersky.
25 The workers’ statement and, what is important, its sup-port by the trade unions, was the last straw.
I personally could not help admitting that the workers’ desire was right and that its satisfaction was an absolute political necessity.
I realise that you find this painful.
But political interest (and the Party decision) unquestionably calls for subordina-tion.
You can very well make use of Svidersky otherwise than as a member of the collegium.
We must tackle this business of getting more workers; I realise that, being swamped with work, you have been unable to give all your attention to the question of recruiting more workers.
I real-ise that, with all this work and your illness, you have been unable to keep altogether in touch with the Party political side either.
Is that so surprising? Don’t let your nerves go.
You should try to live down the painful feeling.
The C.
C.
decision must be accepted and put through.
I can’t come: there is a meeting on.

FRUMKIN 14.
XII.
1920 Comrade Frumkin, I am writing you about your exclusion (and Svidersky’s) from the collegium.
I believe that it was necessary to put through the All-Russia Central Executive Committee’s decision on such members in a pedantic manner—and that is how the C.
C.
has decided.
26 Political conditions demand particular circumspection in this matter, as in the matter of recruiting workers.
I hope you will fully understand that the political considerations, which the C.
C.
has approved, must not and cannot in any sense be interpreted as signi-fying a lack of personal confidence, an underestimation of personal qualities, etc.
(even if there were gossipy attempts to do so).
The new composition of the collegium without yourself must be accepted as a political necessity, and the mistrustand suspicion (of the unwillingness to “recruit workers”, unwillingness to have more democracy, etc.
) should be dispelled by hard work (I personally am sure that you and Svidersky will do this quite easily, and that this will come about of itself through a continuation of your work).
The whole point is to have your work, without the official high rank (member of the collegium), refute all the slanders, all the apprehensions of the workers and the trade unions.
I repeat I am sure that you and Svidersky will understand this and will easily do it.
There and there alone lies the gist of the matter.

34 RE: BÉLA KUN’S PAMPHLET 33 The good thing in the pamphlet is the author’s strength of revolutionary convictions and his unbending faith in the revolution.
His remarks about the party as it should be are good.
His criticism of Social-Democrats is good.
But a glaring shortcoming is the total absence of any facts.
This makes the pamphlet weak.
I should say that of the 55 pages 40 ought to be filled with precise facts (the history of the Social-Democratic Party and the revolution, and also of the counter-revolution in Hungary), giving a summary of the facts and leaving 15 pages for evaluation.
Unless it is rewritten in this way, the pamphlet is extremely weak and not fit for use.

1921 Dear Comrades: From the comrades you have sent, Lavrik, Malikov and Bykov, I learned with great satisfaction how you organised the dispatch of a gift to the working people of the city of Moscow.
In accordance with the mandate of your general meeting, I received from your delegates Invoice No.
243 covering the cargo you dispatched: 2,002 poods of wheat, 1,869 poods 29 pounds of barley and 35 poods of flour, and also a detailed written report about how you carried out the procurement of salt by doing free overtime work, about your voluntary stints without pay on holidays in general, and about your cultural and educational work.
Instructions have been issued to have the cargo, delayed en route through no fault of the comrades you have sent, delivered to the People’s Commissariat for Food, and all the foodstuffs you have sent will be handed over to the workers of the city of Moscow.
I advise you to give more attention to cultural and edu-cational work and the schools.
I hope that through a con-certed effort you will succeed in eliminating all the difficul-ties which arise.
I was especially interested in the communist farming you have introduced.
One of the most important tasks now facing the Republic is the development and boostingof agriculture.
I was happy to hear your report that this year you will be able to develop 2,200 dessiatines as plough-land, and 25 dessiatines as vegetable garden.
You must see to it that your agriculture is organised on the right lines, as agronomic science requires, and I advise you to get a knowledgeable agronomist for that purpose.
* My special request to you is that your work in the com-mune should be so organised as to help peasants in the vicinity and maintain the best relations with them.
Without this and without business-like practical economic success I have little faith in the communes, and am even somewhat apprehensive of them.

1921 Comrade Kruchinsky: I have received your reports on the People’s Commissar-iat for Agriculture.
52 I have read them and reported to the C.

members.
By appointing Osinsky, we, the Central Committee, have done what we could.
Osinsky saw me yesterday and told me that he was getting a number of local comrades, peasants, to join in the work.
Why are you dissatisfied with Osinsky? The whole R.
C.
P.
group of the Eighth Congress of Soviets had a high opinion of him over the seed campaign.
Which Communist workers are dissatisfied with the work and why? Please let me have concrete instructions and proposals.
We in the C.

FRUMKIN * 1/II-1921.
Comrade Frumkin: We have been receiving (from inside and outside) more and more information about the absolutely intolerable “in-dependence” of the Ukraine in matters of the People’s Commissariat for Food.
You must dig right down to the whole truth, which is obviously being concealed from us (to some extent prob-ably unwittingly, by conniving at those whose concealment is deliberate).
This is a serious matter, and we shall not let it go at that; we shall find out the whole truth.
We shall fully expose the role of Peshekhonov (worse than any whiteguard), who had clearly been fooling the Ukrainian C.
C.
(we do not yet know through whom he had done that, but we shall find out).
But just now, and above all, you are fully responsible for finding out and getting at all the facts, and must see to it that you are not duped by Peshekhonov and those who have been deceived by the Peshekhonovs.

GOIKHBARG Comrade Goikhbarg: About the reports by the People’s Commissars, you (the Narrow Council) should pay particular attention to the execution of the most important decisions.
56 The burning question today is flats in Moscow.
Appoint check-ups, with reports in the Narrow Council twice a week: how many houses, flats, rooms have been given (you will recall that 10 houses have to be given).
Also check up on the allocation.
The population of Moscow is being inflated by the grow-ing staffs.
This should be verified; perhaps, we should adopt a decision.
A People’s Commissariat increasing the number of its staffs without the permission of the Narrow Council should be subjected to various penalties (prohibition to increase even by one person).
Draw up a list of the People’s Commissariats which are to reduce the number of their staffs weekly (People’s Com-missariat for Defence, the Supreme Economic Council, the People’s Commissariat for Railways and certain others).
The rest may increase their staffs only with the permission of the Narrow Council.

Some of the Ukrainian C.

That is clear.
We too shall not allow ourselves to be fooled any longer.
I authorise you, on your personal responsibility (on condition of secret and direct and regular communication with the Politbureau in Moscow) to: (1) keep Peshekhonov under full observation; (2) send the results here; (3) similarly with all the other Peshekhonovites, a list of them; (4) secure Peshekhonov’s immediate resignation and his dispatch to Moscow.
The Ukrainian C.

1921 Comrade Sklyansky: Let me have the telegram from the Saratov Gubernia military commissar, the “reply” to which from the Com-mander-in-Chief you sent me today.

It is a bureaucratic handout, instead of a business-like approach: banditry must be wiped out, instead of being formally written about.
Let them give me, twice a week, brief, very brief results of the fight against banditry.
Also bring home to the field staff that they should work, instead of writing formal notes.

So Krzhizhanovsky strongly recommends him for membership of the General Planning Commission of the Council of Labour and Defence.
I think this Commission should, as a general rule, con-sist of specialists, a worker, by way of exception.
I have told Osinsky as much and should like to know your opinion.

Re: Your No.
672 In view of the extremely grave food supply situation at the centre, I propose: three-quarters to be brought down here, one-quarter left for the cities and workers of the Ukraine; the peasants must be rewarded at any cost, within the bounds of possibility, and if we have nothing, then by making purchases abroad for gold or oil.
If you disagree with this, make another concession to the peasants, but bear in mind that the food crisis over here is desperate and downright dangerous.

OSINSKY 1.
III.
1921 Comrade Osinsky: Yesterday I saw Ivan Afanasyevich Chekunov.
It turned out that he had already been to see me in 1919 on the ques-tion of a congress of toiling peasants.
Now he says: it is better to start with regional ones.
He sympathises with the Communists, but will not join the Party, because he goes to church and is a Christian (he says he rejects the ritual but is a believer).
He has been improving his farm.
He has toured Nizhni-Novgorod and Simbirsk gubernias.
He says the peasants have lost confidence in the Soviet power.
I asked him whether we could right things with a tax? He thinks we could.
In his own uyezd, he has succeeded, with the help of the workers, to substitute a good Soviet authority for the bad one.
That is the kind of people we must do our utmost to hold on to, in order to restore the confidence of the peasant mass.
This is the main political task and one which brooks no delay.
My earnest request: see that the “apparatus” stand-point does not run away with you, and do not worry too much over it.
Devote more attention to the political attitude towards the peasantry.
I think we must “capture” Chekunov immediately, i.
e.
, involve him in our activity.
How are we to do this? This needs thinking about.
Perhaps we should set up right away (rather start) a “toiling peasant council” or a “non-Party peasant council” (perhaps, the latter name is more guarded for keeping out those whom Chekunov calls the “hissers”, i.
e.
, the downright kulaks and enemies of the Soviet power).
Chekunov should be appointed right away as the authorised representative of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture to organise (or prepare) such an institution.
He should be urgently sent to Simbirsk Gubernia (we need an adviser and a mediator from a gubernia with surplus grain, better two mediators) and be given this assignment: to bring us over here from Simbirsk Gubernia (where he knows various people) a non-Party Russian peasant, a man advanced in years and a farmer, who favours the toiling peasants and the workers, and is not a “hisser”.
Another one must also be found.
Three would be best: Chekunov&the man from Simbirsk&another from a gubernia not growing grain.
This trio of “old men” (it would be good for all of them to be both non-Party men and Christians) we will at once turn either into non-voting members of the collegium, or into the nucleus of a “non-Party peasant council”, or a similar corporation.
This must be done speedily, at once (he intends to leave the day after tomorrow).
Strike while the iron’s hot.
Let me have your reply.

I think we should allow greater quantities to be trans-ported.
71 Your fear of speculation is excessive.
Will it be so bad if they exchange individually for grain? The peasants will obtain footwear and clothing.
What we should fear is mass speculation, and we cannot allow spec-ulation on a professional basis.
But we should not hamper but encourage importation into poverty-stricken Russia.

The question is pivoted on “turnover”, free economic exchange for the peasantry.
You have not gone into the question deeply enough, since you were arguing against Rakovsky (I had no time for a rejoinder).
The whole point is to be able to promotecommerce, exchange (both export abroad from the south and exchange with the factories).
Otherwise, we shall collapse.
NB Think about this and find a formula to insert this.
2) Ask for these figures right away: how much grain we gave in January 1921 and in February NB (if there are no figures for the whole of February, then for one-third or two-thirds of it) 1921.
How much imported, and how much altogether.

Mr.
Washington B.
Vanderlip Dear Sir, I thank you for your kind letter of the 14th, and am very glad to hear of President Harding’s favourable views as to our trade with America.
You know what value we attach to our future American business relations.
We fully recognise the part played in this respect by your syndicate and also the great importance of your personal efforts.
83 Your new proposals are highly interesting and I have asked the Supreme Council of National Economy to report to me at short intervals about the progress of the negotiations.
You can be sure that we will treat every reasonable suggestion with the greatest attention and care.
* It is on production and trade that our efforts are principally concentrated and your help is to us of the greatest value.
If you have to complain of some officials please send your complaint to the respective People’s Commissary who will investigate the matter and report if necessary.
I have already ordered special investigation concerning the person you mention in your letter.
* See Document 94 of this volume.

1921 Dear Comrade Joffe: I was highly distressed to read your deeply perturbed letter of 15/III.
84 I see that you have the most legitimate grounds for dissatisfaction and even indignation, but I assure you that you are wrong in seeking the causes of it.
First, you are wrong in saying (repeatedly) that “I am the C.
C.
”.
This could have been written only in a state of great nervous irritation and overwork.
The old C.
C.
(1919-1920) defeated me on one of the vastly important questions, as you must know from the discussion.
85 I cannot say how many times I have been in a minority on organisa-tional and personal matters.
You must have seen this for yourself on many occasions as a member of the C.
C.
You should not allow yourself to be so nervous as to write such an absolutely impossible, absolutely impossible thing that I am the C.
C.
This is overwork.
Second, I do not feel the slightest dissatisfaction with you or mistrust of you in any way.
Nor do the members of the C.
C.
, as far as I know them, have spoken to them and seen their attitude towards you.
What then is the explanation of the matter? It is that you have been tossed about by fate.
I have seen this happen to many workers.
Take Stalin, as an example.
You must know that he would have stood up for himself, in any case.
But “fate” did not allow him, a single time in three and a half years, to be either People’s Commissar for the Work-ers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, or People’s Commissar for Nationalities.
That is a fact.
You, like rather many other leading workers, have been tossed about by fate.
You are one of our first and best di-plomatists.
Our diplomacy has been working on and off.
In the intervals, you have been “tried out” (W.
P.
I.
), without giving you time to finish things.
It is the fault (the mis-fortune?) of the whole C.
C.
, which has tossed about many people in this way.
If you give this some cool thought, you will see that this is true.
Failure to be elected to the All-Russia Central Executive Committee? Ask anyone, Trotsky, for instance, how often the C.
C.
has hesitated in its views of the principle and its decisions on this! This has happened many times! We were forced to make maximum renewals for considerations of “democracy”.
(The new C.
C.
was constituted only yesterday and will take some time to “gear up”.
86 ) My personal opinion, which is quite frank, is: (1) you must have a good rest.
It is harmful to fray oneself.
We are badly in need of experienced, veteran, tested workers.
Have a good rest.
Perhaps, you will decide that it is better to go to a sanatorium, abroad.
It is bad over here.
Your health must be completely restored.
(2) You have been and remain one of our leading and best diplomatists and poli-ticians.
Take Turkey? Turkestan? Can we do without you? Rumania? I’m afraid we cannot.
I think we cannot.
Have a rest.
Then come to Moscow, we shall have a talk.

PREOBRAZHENSKY 27/III.
Comrade Preobrazhensky: The “co-operative” circles, headed by Prokopovich, Kuskova & Co.
, are said to wish to make this proposal to the government: we shall help you to restore the currency, if you allow us to issue bonds secured by our (co-operative) com-modity stocks.
This is ridiculous, because it is tantamount to the capitalists’ proposal: we shall help you to restore the cur-rency, if you let us have commodity stocks.
But apart from being ridiculous, it emphasises the gist of the matter: we must start just now, when the tax in kind and the exchange (for grain) are being introduced, to make systematic preparations to “improve” the currency through the issue of bonds secured by commodities (the commodity stocks, the grain stocks, etc.
).
There must be no delay over this.
This should be thought out, prepared and started, without waiting for the settlement of the silver issue.
Have you brought all this up for your commission, and in it? 93 Drop me a couple of lines by 11 a.

1921 Comrade Serebrovsky: I am sending you some material on the oil concessions.
I wanted to send it along with Comrade Kaminsky, but unfortunately, because of his grave illness, he had to be given treatment over here.
It is extremely important for the Baku comrades to adopt the correct view of the concessions (a view approved by the Tenth Party Congress, i.
e.
, binding on all Party members).
It is highly desirable to let the concessionaires have a quar-ter of Baku (or perhaps two-quarters) (on condition of as-sistance from abroad both in foodstuffs and equipment, over and above the concessionaires’ own requirements * ).
Only then is there any hope of using the other three-quar-ters (or two-quarters) to catch up with (and then to forge ahead of) modern advanced capitalism.
Any other view boils down to the most harmful attitude of a “walk-over”, “we’ll manage on our own”, and other such-like rubbish which presents an increasingly greater danger the more it is clad in “purely communist” attire.
* I had a telegram from Krasin yesterday in reply to the draft concession terms sent to him: “acceptable in the main.
” Krasin, let me add, has a knowledge of this business not from communist pamphlets!Write me at once if there are still any traces (even the slightest) of these most harmful views and prejudices in Baku (among the workers and among the intellectuals): do you undertake to dispel these prejudices yourself and secure the most loyal implementation of the congress de-cision (for the concessions) or do you need my help? Make sure that you and everyone else realise that “the concessions are extremely desirable.
There is nothing more harmful or fatal for communism than communist boasting—we’ll manage on our own”.
Now that we have Batum, we must do our utmost to arrange the speediest possible exchange of oil and kerosene for equipment abroad.
For this the Baku district needs some independence.
If you do not have it, telegraph precisely, we shall let you have it.
101 Formulate precise proposals—send them over to the C.
L.
D.
by telegram and letter.
There is need for a regional economic centre, responsible for Baku&Batum, etc.
, and conducting operations independently, swiftly, without red tape.
We cannot help you from over here, we are poor our-selves.
You must help us by buying everything necessary from abroad in exchange for oil and oil products.
Awaiting your reply: a short one by telegram (“letter of 2/IV received, prejudices over concessions exist, hard (or easy) to overcome, concerning exchange of goods with foreign countries and the regional centre, will do or are-doing so-and-so”) and give details, by mail.
There is an urgent necessity for correct contacts with the C.
L.
D.
; that is the main thing.
Another question: is there a correct approach in Baku to the question of oil from the standpoint of co-ordinat-ing the various aspects of the national economy? After all, the territory is very rich: forests, fertile land (given the irrigation), etc.
We are pumping water (with oil) but not using the water for irrigation, which would yield great crops of hay, rice, cotton? Not making use of the “north wind” to run windmills? But, of course, foodstuffs and irrigation are the main things.
Is it possible to developthe oil industry without developing irrigation and farming around Baku? Is anyone thinking about this and working on it properly? What about the English irrigation plan?

103 Please find out the details from the Georgian Revolutionary Committee.
First, has the Soviet Government of Georgia confirmed the concession on the Tkvarcheli mines to the Italians, when, on what terms, reply briefly by telegram, details by letter? Second, about the Chiatura manganese mines: have the German owners been transferred to the status of lessees or concessionaires, when, on what terms.
It is ex-tremely important to have the speediest decisions on these and similar other matters.
This is of tremendous importance both for Georgia and for Russia, because the concessions, especially to Italy and Germany, are absolutely necessary, as is the exchange of goods for oil, on a large scale with these countries, and subsequently, with others as well.

Comrade Kamenev: It is said that within three or four months the workers will demand the lifting of free trading.
We do not want, they say, to see the bureaucrats eat buns.
Perhaps, we should take measures in advance: 1) at once press forward to the utmost with holiday homes.
Increase their number during the summer and the autumn.
Later, we shall also sometimes buy “buns” for the “holiday-makers” by turns; 2) think about other ways of taking turns in purchasing gifts for children or those awarded bonuses.
But the first thing is more important.
Write me what you think and what is being done.
3) At Ivanovo-Voznesensk we should set up a Sverdlov University for 1,000-1,500 persons.

1921.
Comrades Zetkin and Levi: Thank you very much for your letters, dear Friends.
Unfortunately, I have been so busy and so overworked in the last few weeks that I have had practically no opportun-ity to read the German press.
The only thing I have seen is the Open Letter, 1 1 5 which I think is perfectly correct tactics (I have condemned the contrary opinion of our “Lefts” who were opposed to this letter).
As for the recent strike movement and the action in Germany, I have read absolutely nothing about it.
1 1 6 I readily believe that the representative of the Executive Committee defended the silly tactics, which were too much to the left—to take immediate action “to help the Russians”: this representative is very often too Left.
1 1 7 I think that in such cases you should not give in but should protest and immediately bring up this question officially at a plenary meeting of the Executive Bureau.
I consider your tactics in respect of Serrati erroneous.
Any defence or even semi-defence of Serrati was a mistake.
But to withdraw from the Central Committee!!?? That, in any case, was the biggest mistake! If we tolerate the practice of responsible members of the Central Committee withdrawing from it when they are left in a minority, the Communist Parties will never develop normally or become strong.
1 1 8 Instead of withdrawing, it would have been better to discuss the controversial question several times jointly with the Executive Committee.
Now, Comrade Levi wants to write a pamphlet, i.
e.
, to deepen the contradic-tion! What is the use of all this?? I am convinced that it is a big mistake.
119 Why not wait? The congress opens here on June 1.
1 2 0 Why not have a private discussion here, before the congress? * On the copy, Lenin made the following remarks: “This is my reply to Levi and Zetkin, 16/4, 1921”, “Keep in the archives.
Make another or 3 copies”, “Return”, “received 17/V—1921”.
—Ed.
Without public polemics, without withdrawals, without pamphlets on differences.
We are so short of tried and tested forces that I am really indignant when I hear com-rades announcing their withdrawal, etc.
There is need to do everything possible and a few things that are impossible to avoid withdrawals and aggravation of differences at all costs .
Our position in February and March was grave.
This is a peasant country, with a peasant economy—the vast major-ity of the population.
They vacillate, they are ruined and are disgruntled.
But we should not be too pessimistic.
We have made some timely concessions.
And I am sure that we shall win.
Best regards and wishes.

ORJONIKIDZE According to available information, the Georgian State Bank with full staffs of qualified employees and with de-posits from foreign missions has remained in Georgia.

A new photoelement has been invented which, coupled with an amplifier valve, makes it possible at some distance (20-30 metres) to record the emanation of radio (oscillation) energy.
With the action of this photoelement, an amplifying device directed at a (black or white) object will throw its reflection on a screen with the aid of a8 receiving radio station.
With an improved instrument, the following results could be achieved: 1) with a radio telephone, a moving image of a speaking person could be seen on the screen, 2) an enemy squad-ron, moving hundreds of versts away, could be reflected on the screen.

PREOBRAZHENSKY 19/IV.
Comrade Preobrazhensky: Some of your remarks today show that you think the Politbureau decision on the professors to be a mistake.
123 I’m afraid there is here some misunderstanding.
I’m afraid you have not interpreted the decision precisely.
I quite allow that Kalinnikov (that’s his name, isn’t it?) is a reactionary.
There are also, unquestionably, mali-cious Cadets 124 among them.
But they should be exposed in a different way.
And exposed they should be on concrete occasions.
Give such an assignment to Kozmin (but he is not too clever: watch your step with him): come up with an exposure over a precise fact, act or statement.
Then wecan put him in jail for a month, or a year.
That will be a lesson to him.
The same applies to a malicious Cadet.
The same, if class enemies have slandered Ignatov (? that’s his name, isn’t it? I do not know him).
We must prepare the material, verify it, expose the culprits and condemn them in the full view of all, and impose exemplary punishment.
The military specialist is caught out on treason.
But the military specialists have all been recruited, and are working.
Lunacharsky and Pokrovsky don’t know how to “catch out” their own specialists and, being dissatisfied with themselves, are taking it out of everybody else.
That is Pokrovsky’s mistake.
In fact, you and I may not have all that many differences.
The worst thing about the People’s Commissariat for Education is the lack of system, of self-control.
Their communist cells are also shockingly “lax”.
The people over at the P.
C.
E.
have still to learn how to work out methods of “catching out” their specialists and punishing them, and of catching out and training the com-munist cells.

ZINOVIEV 24/IV.
Comrade Zinoviev: In view of the extremely unsatisfactory quality of the “specimen copy” of the Atlas of Russia (although it has taken many months to prepare), please let me know the names of all those responsible for the work, those who had been doing it before and are doing it now.
Here is a short list of the defects.
I received a “specimen copy” of the Atlas of Russia yesterday.
(The First State Cartographic Establishment, for-mer owner Ilyin.
) The Atlas of Russia should and must become a school atlas.
But this calls for a number of corrections and additions, because the specimen copy is highly unsatisfactory.
I list the main defects, requiring unconditional cor-rection.
1.
There is no text “from the publisher” (there used to be one before).
Such a text should be written, saying that on the model of “Railways”, the present school atlas has been compiled in accordance with such-and-such a plan.
2.
The maps are not numbered, and there are no sym-bols (they were there before).
These should be added.
The maps should not be by railways or not only by railways, but by gubernias as well.
The numeration of the maps should contain a list of the gubernias included in full.
And the gubernias entered in the list should be given on the map in full.
Map No.
1 does not contain gubernias in full: Petrograd, Pskov and others.
Cherepovets and other gubernias are not designated.
There are similar defects in the other maps.
Correct this.
3.
The boundaries of the republics (the Ukraine) and the autonomous regions should be specifically shown.
This has mostly not been done.
Neither for the Ukraine, nor for Byelorussia.
(The German Commune? Mari Region? All the Caucasian republics?) 4.
The railway lines have not been verified for a given date (say, 1.
I.
1921).
Their indication is incorrect.
The finished lines are not specified.
The ones under construc-tion are not shown.
Correct this.
5.
Every map should have a small explanatory text (on the other side or as an inset): state boundaries under such-and-such a treaty (when approved and ratified).
Autono-mous regions established on such-and-such a date.
The population of the gubernias and the chief cities, in accord-ance with the census of August 1920.
Etc.
6.
On account of a ludicrous oversight, the old numerationof the maps has been taken, i.
e.
, left: No.
X—Moscow, No.
XII—the Crimea, and others!! There should be a new numeration.
7.
Neither the Tatar Republic nor the Bashkirian Republic are given in full in No.
XIV.
They should be given in full.
The same applies to all autonomous regions.
The national make-up of the autonomous regions should be given accord-ing to the latest data (in the explanatory text).
8.
Of the old maps these have been omitted: Saratov and the surrounding gubernias Simbirsk, Penza and the surrounding gubernias Rostov-on-Don and the surrounding gubernias Smolensk and the surrounding gubernias (Byelo-russia) The Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper The Caucasus (the boundaries of all the new repub-lics must be shown without fail).
The Atlas must be a full one.
All the gubernias should be there.
An incomplete atlas is of no use at all, and the specimen copy is outrageously incomplete.
9.
Instead of additions (in bold type) below and in the margin: the distance by rail (this is taken from the old atlas)—there should be short distances not only by rail.
10.
Add: a map with the plan for electrification (from the book Plan for Electrification Submitted to the Eighth Congress of Soviets).
11.
Add a map of institutions of higher learning (uni-versities, etc.
) and educational establishments by gubernias (at least on the strength of the information already available).
12.
Add: a map of radio stations.
13.
Historical maps (the two new ones at the end) are no good.
Incomplete.
They contain mistakes.
Instead of these two, there should be: (a) one of the same size: a historical map of Soviet Russia.
Front lines by date (for instance: V.
1918; XII.
1918; V or VI.
1919; XI or XII.
1919; I and XI.
1920) with these remarks: the names of the fronts on the given date.
The state boundary of the whole of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
and of all the neighbouring republics (which had been within the empire).
(b) A map of the whole of the R.

LEZHAVA Comrade Lezhava: Georgia is of exceptional importance as a cover for Russia ’ s foreign trade.
This is convenient also for Italy, and Germany, and America.
1) Find a brainy fellow to be sent there on behalf of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.
Do it as fast as you can! 2) Have a more detailed talk about this with Stalin.
Do this today.
3) Drop me a couple of lines on the results.
We need a plan (and a fund) for foreign trade via Batum.
You have no foreign trade plan.
You are allowing a lot of waste and letting others do the same.
I am going to fight you.
Here’s your line: not a kopek more for foodstuffs or for fuel in 1921.
Draw up a plan on this line, and do not suc-cumb to “pressures” or “influences”.

TROTSKY 30/IV.
Comrade Trotsky: I have read Shatunovsky’s pamphlet, White Coal and Revolutionary Petrograd.
129 Very weak.
Nothing but rhetoric.
Not the least bit of sound matter.
The only business-like hint is on page 15: “Outstanding hydraulics specialists believe it will take no more than eight months to see the real fruits of this great endeavour.
” Who is a specialist? We have none (I have asked Krzhi-zhanovsky: there are none).
Shatunovsky has undertaken to write of what he knows nothing about (that’s Krzhizha-novsky’s assessment).
Apart from this unsubstantiated remark, there’s nil in the whole pamphlet.
Let Shatunovsky give proof and set out business propos-als.
Otherwise, the idle talk remains what it is.

There were no clear-cut proposals written out separately.
I was busy and was not able to read them; they were pickled until 23/V.
All this while you kept silent! This is outrageous! You should have appended two papers: a) We request the closure of the “Politbureaus”, * because they are utterly useless (five lines).
Adding that the documents had been sent to Lenin.
b) We request that the telegram (or the telephone mes-sage) should be signed: Why the 2 (4) boilers have not been issued, give reasons, do not allow red tape.

It is not hard to enclose two or three papers containing five lines each, with copies to Fotieva.

BRYUKHANOV ** Comrade Bryukhanov: The food committees seem to be growing lax, and very considerably, too.
This is absolutely intolerable.
Discipline must be tightened up to the utmost, and at once, otherwise we shall never be rid of the famine.
1) The People’s Commissariat for Food must designate the responsible persons in the gubernias and in the uyezds, to know who is to go to jail (1) the uyezd commissar for food? 2) the chairman of the uyezd executive committee? 3) the uyezd military commissar?? There should be at least three responsible persons).
* See Document 142 of this volume.
—Ed.
** At the top Lenin wrote: “Make two copies on letterhead.
”—E d .
2) Not a single violation (such as taking for the local-ities what is earmarked for the centre) should be allowed to go without the arrest of the guilty (through the All-Russia Central Executive Committee).
You keep writing long papers with complaints, 159 rather: with wails, instead of business proposals: “authorise the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
to arrest the persons concerned for failing to carry out orders resulting in famine at the centre.
” That is the kind of proposal the People’s Commissariat for Food should bring up in the Politbureau.
3) A similar campaign of relentless arrests of members of local gubernia food committees, etc.
, should be started right away for negligence, failure to make due preparations, etc.
The People’s Commissariat for Food will be held res-ponsible for the unprepared state of the apparatus and for its lack of dispatch.

KHALATOV 26/V.
1921.
Comrade Khalatov: I must state with deep regret that there has been no improvement in the running of the Allocation Administra-tion of the People’s Commissariat for Food.
There is the same old chaos of figures.
The raw figures have got hold of you, instead of the other way round.
You have given me a heap of figures, heaps of undigest-ed raw material.
On the same day we have the Muscovites coming and wailing: not the slightest improvement.
I call up Bryukhanov and Svidersky.
They bring along Vyshinsky.
He gave these figures:in 8 days (18-25.
V) Moscow has received 165 carloads (excluding oats).
165 : 8= 20 s .
The Muscovites say: we’ve not been get-ting even 18 regularly.
Furthermore: for five days, 26-31, there will be (says Vyshinsky) 90 of grain&6 3 of oats.
The Muscovites say: we cannot handle more than 1,000 [poods] of oats a day!!! This means there is actually a worsening: !! 26-31.
V as compared with 18-25.
V!!! !! A worsening instead of the improvement you promised: there were 20 s of grain, there will be 1 8 of grain&1(?) of oats (?).
160 I repeat my request: non multa sed multum.
* Fewer figures, but more matter.
Why not take grain alone? Only grain, without the oats.
But precisely: how much Moscow is to get a day.
Concen-trate on that.

ALSKY 29/V.
1921.
Comrade Alsky: I draw your attention to this report, which has been submitted to me by a comrade from the All-Russia Extraor-dinary Commission, who had been specially authorised by me, in agreement with Comrade Dzerzhinsky.
I appointed the inquiry which has produced this report after a communica-tion I had had from the most reliable Communists that things were not quite well at Gokhran.
163 Comrade Bokii’s communication fully confirms this.
I draw your most serious attention to this fact.
You, above all, and then all the members of the Colle-gium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance, and Com-rade Basha especially, must devote ten times more work to Gokhran.
Unless things are reorganised at Gokhran within the shortest period in such a way as absolutely to exclude the possibility of stealing, while at the same time acceler-ating all the work and enlarging its scale, the Deputy People’s Commissar and all the members of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance will be faced not only with Party, but also with criminal charges.
Because of the delay in the Gokhran work (it is harder to work in winter and a great deal has to be done before it sets in), and because of the stealing there, the Republic is suffering vast losses, for precisely at this time, in these hard days, we must obtain the maximum of valuables quickly for commodity exchange with foreign countries.
It is necessary: 1) to organise regular and frequent conferences with Bokii for the earliest reorganisation of Gokhran; 2) to bring the protection and surveillance to perfection (special railings, wooden partitions; lockers or partitions for changing; surprise searches; systems of double and triple surprise check-ups in accordance with all the rules of the art of criminal investigation, etc.
, etc.
); 3) to recruit, in case of necessity, dozens and hundreds of responsible and absolutely honest Communists in Moscowto participate (say, once a month or two months) in surprise, day and night, audits.
The staffs and the inspectors must be given instructions in the minutest detail; 4) it shall be the duty of every member of the P.
C.
F.
Collegium, without exception, to conduct in person, at least once a month, day and night surprise inspections of Go-khran, at the work places and wherever else stealing may occur.
The Deputy People’s Commissar shall keep a per-sonal secret register of these inspections.
In view of the secret character of this paper, I request you to return it to me at once, and to have all the members of the P.

Collegium sign it in person.

LUTOVINOV 30.
V Comrade Lutovinov: I have read your letter of 20/V, and it has left me with a very sad impression.
I expected that in Berlin, having had a rest, having recovered from your illness, having taken a look “from outside” (you always get a clearer view from outside), and having thought things out, you would arrive at clear-cut and exact conclusions.
Over here, you were in a “mood” of dissatisfaction.
A mood which was almost unconscious, a blind feeling, not resulting from thought.
So I expected you to have clear-cut and exact conclusions instead of the mood.
Perhaps, I thought, we would differ over the conclusions, but these would still be clear-cut and exact conclusions drawn by one of the “founders” of the “opposition” (as you admit yourself to be in your letter).
Your letter leaves a sad impression because, insteadof clarity and precision, there is again this dark mood with the addition of “tough words”.
You must not allow this.
Facts—you will recall this yourself—are stubborn things.
So have a look at what are the facts you mention.
I list all your factual statements: 1) The railwaymen’s C.
C.
is made up of “old bureau-crats”.
Is that a fact? The names? I don’t know anyone except Rudzutak, but I do know that it was made up with care.
There could have been mistakes.
They must be corrected.
But for that they should be first pinpointed, so as to leave no room for any dark moods (and the gossip which fre-quently lurks in this darkness: gossip loves darkness and anonymity).
You have not given any names.
There are no facts.
Rudzutak? What’s wrong with him as a worker? “He is physically worn-out”? Is there anyone among us who isn’t? We shall get him back from Turkestan as soon as we put Joffe and Sokolnikov back on their feet.
What then does our “tendentious factionalism” consist of? Is it the fact that a supporter of the Party congress majority is put at the head of the railwaymen’s C.
C.
? Is that what you call “factionalism”? If that is so, please explain to me what meaning should be given to factional-ism and to the Party spirit.
Surely you will not declare that it was acting in the “Party spirit” for the leader of the former Workers’ Oppo-sition to introduce a C.
C.
list at the Metalworkers’ Con-gress a few days ago, where of the 22 R.
C.
P.
members, 19 are supporters of the old Workers’ Opposition? 164 If that is not “tendentious factionalism”, if that is not reviving the faction, then I must say that you have been using the concept of factionalism in a most specific way, most un-usually, even out of the human context.
2) You say that at the head of the All-Russia Central T.
U.
C.
there is a “physically worn-out person”, i.
e.
, Tom-sky? He was to have been replaced by a trio of secretaries, and has now been removed altogether.
Thus, your shot at factionalism has ricocheted against you.
There’s already a fact for you.
3) In your struggle against the outrages of the Berlin mission you have come up against “fierce resistance from Moscow all the way up to Ilyich”.
You will pardon me if I say that this is an inven-tion.
You gave excessive praise to Stomonyakov, who was defended by Krasin.
Kopp was at the head of the old mis-sion.
Kopp was removed, Stomonyakov has remained.
What is this? Is it “fierce resistance from Moscow”? Or is it a fierce lie about Moscow? In the light of the “facts”, which of these tough words is closer to the truth? What about that? There have been scandalous practices at the Berlin mis-sion, Moscow (and Krasin) did not hamper or resist you, but helped you to combat them, by giving more authority to Stomonyakov, whom you extolled most decidedly.
4) You say you have discovered there, in Berlin, a num-ber of the “most brazen scoundrels and thieves”, and Mos-cow has not removed them.
Their names? There is not a single one.
Is that a fact or a piece of gossip? Perhaps you are not aware of the way complaints are addressed to the C.
C.
? to the Orgbureau? to the Politbu-reau? to the C.
C.
Plenary Meeting? There has not been a single complaint from you either in the Politbureau or the Plenary Meeting.
There’s a fact for you.
(In brackets: you and I had a difference over Shklovsky, but you did not put it before the Politbureau.
165 I knew Shklovsky as a Bolshevik for years before the revolution.
Being an honest man, he would have helped you to combat the “scoundrels and thieves”.
But you impeded Shklov-sky’s departure for Berlin, although over here he is not much of a worker, not doing anything important.
) 5) Grzhebin.
About him, and only about him, I read yesterday the protest you and Stomonyakov sent in to the C.
C.
We shall examine it at the earliest sitting.
166 We in the C.
C.
have had our differences over Grzhebin.
Some said: he should be removed altogether, because he might be cheating as a publisher.
Others said: as a publisher he will publish at a lower cost.
We prefer to have him cheatus out of 10,000, but put out the cheaper and better publi-cation.
A commission of both sides equally represented was elected.
I was not on it, because of my “partiality” (some said) to Gorky, who defended Grzhebin.
The commission decided the case unanimously.
I don’t remember what it decided exactly.
I think it was to buy from Grzhebin if it was cheaper.
Consequently, your conclusion: “they were not guided by state considerations”, but were trying to pacify Gorky— is a downright untruth.
And you write: “I am sure”!!! What do you call it when the people work out a “conviction” for themselves before checking on the facts, which are easily checked? 6) Lomonosov is a brilliant specialist, but has been “exposed by Krasin as engaging in the most criminal commercial transactions”.
That is not true.
If Krasin had exposed Lomonosov committing a crime, Lomonosov would have been removed and prosecuted.
You heard a rumour and turned it into a piece of scandal.
Krasin wrote me and the C.
C.
: Lomonosov is a brilliant specialist, but is less suitable in trade and has made mis-takes.
Having come over here, and having met Lomonosov and examined the documents, Krasin said nothing about mistakes, let alone crime.
Here is your choice: either to start a serious case in the Control Commission (or wherever else you wish) about Lomonosov’s crimes, or to retract the rumour you have so flippantly picked up.
7) “We are having appointments to the trade department here of rogues like this one: in the past a manufacturer whom the Soviet power deprived of all his furs, and he is now being sent to sell these furs.
For pity’s sake, what are things coming to?” That is what you write.
This is indeed good reason to feel sad.
The founder of the whole opposition reasoning on such lines! It’s the same thing as an ignorant muzhik saying: “A thousand tsarist generals were deprived of their land and rank, and these generals have now been attached to the RedArmy”! Indeed, we have possibly over a thousand of those who had been generals and landowners under the tsar, serv-ing in key posts in the Red Army.
But it has won.
God will forgive the ignorant muzhik.
Who’s going to forgive you? If you know that there is a “rogue”, how can you, a per-son in office under the Soviet power, hush up his name? Not start proceedings against this so-and-so? But if you don’t know his name, it means this is just another rumour? just another piece of scandal? I have gone over virtually everything in your letter that has any semblance at all of being a fact.
The result is an absolute zero.
If I did not know you, then having received such a letter as yours, I should have said: either this man has had a nervous breakdown and is hysterically snatching at scraps of gossip, and is quite unable to think, reason and verify; or it is a man who is helpless because of his backward-ness and ignorance, and who has fallen victim to scandal-mongering; or it is a disguised Menshevik deliberately engaging in scandal-mongering.
Because I know you, I say to you that your letter is a remarkable “human document” which shows how the “foun-der of the opposition” has allowed himself to give way to a desire to play opposition at all costs, and to shout, for no good reason, about patronage, about stick-in-the-mud commissars, about the system, etc.
You write: “After all, it is not personalities, but the system itself that matters.
Just now I raise this question: is this the proletariat or a demagnetised, declassed petty-bourgeois intelligentsia.
” That is ridiculous.
In fact, your own letter is a fine hu-man document showing up the author as a specimen of the demagnetised petty-bourgeois intelligentsia.
For the pro-fessional proletarians have repeatedly yielded up in actual life demagnetised petty-bourgeois intellectuals, according to their real class role.
The demagnetised petty-bourgeois intellectual keeps whimpering and wailing, is put out by any sign of evilor scandalous practice, loses his self-possession, echoes any piece of scandal, and is all puffed up in his efforts to say something incoherent about a “system”.
The proletarian (not one by reason of an old profession but one by his actual class role), when faced with evil, takes up the fight in a business-like manner: he gives open and official support to the candidacy of the good worker Ivan, proposes the removal of the bad Peter, starts a case— and conducts it vigorously, firmly and to the end—against the rogue Sidor, against the act of patronage on the part of Tit, against Miron’s most criminal transaction, and (after two or three months of experience in his new job, and practical acquaintance with his new environment) works out business-like and practical proposals: to introduce such-and-such a system of commissars or political commissars, to make the following changes in the routine here, and to assign so many well-known Communists (with the following record) to the specified posts.
That is the kind of proletarians, who, even after they have lost their proletarian profession, were able to build the Red Army and to win with it (despite the thousand traitors and rogues, of whom thousands still remain among the military specialists and the military bureaucrats).
That is the kind of proletarians who will never descend to the class role of the demagnetised petty-bourgeois in-tellectuals, thrashing about in impotence, yielding to scan-dal, and calling scraps of gossip a “system”.
There you have my frank answer.
I can afford to reply in full once in a while—mostly I haven’t the time to do so.
For old time’s sake, let me tell you this: you need to do something about your nerves.
Then the mood will give way to reasoning.

1921 Comrade Sklyansky: On the question of making use of the Army for economic purposes.
This must always be borne in mind.
A systematic plan for such use should be thought-out, prepared and elaborated, and unswervingly implement-ed .
Two aspects of this matter stand out especially: 1) the current, most urgent economic works (guarding and extraction of salt; fuel supply, etc.
); 2) the work in implementing the general state-economic plan over a number of years.
The electrification plan for ten years (the first part of the works) calls for 370 million working days.
This gives an annual (37 : 1.
6)= 24 work-ing days, i.
e.
, two days a month per armyman.
Of course, a host of difficulties will arise from the con-ditions of the Army’s billeting, the transportation to the place of work, etc.
, etc.
, but the Army still can and must (with the aid of the Universal Military Training Board) render vast assistance in this matter of electrification.
The Army should be attached to this great undertaking—ideo-logically, organisationally and economically—and it should be an object of systematic effort.
Please raise this question in the Revolutionary Milit-ary Council of the Republic, by reading out this letter.
I should be glad to hear the views of the Council members or at least to have their short comments on this question.

Moscow must not receive less fuel in 1921-1922 than in 1920-1921.
This, at all costs.
There is need 1) specially to impose responsibility for this on Danishevsky; 2) to make a detailed division of this task into component parts, and assign each part to a special person, precisely designated; 3) to send more men to work especially for Moscow Fuel Committee (perhaps you will take Goldberg? later recruit-ing Radchenko, even if only for a certain portion of time, etc.

4) You personally must make repeated special and spe-cific check-ups and inspections, and redouble your efforts to make a good job of it.

will interrupt the whole Gosplan from its general work less frequently with its par-ticular assignments, and this will also make for more pro-ductive Gosplan operations and for the establishment of more precise responsibilities of its members.
Please have this proposal put up for discussion by the Presidium, and inform me of its decision.

1921 Comrade Alsky: I should like to help Comrade Gastev, Director of the Institute of Labour.
He needs to make additional purchases worth 500,000 in gold.
That is, of course, something we cannot afford just now.
Could something be bought in Germany with the Ro-manov funds? Think about this, find out more exactly and try to get him a certain amount.
We should, all things considered, give support to such an institution, even with the situation as difficult as it is.

MOLOTOV Comrade Molotov: Please have a look at the enclosed letter from Shklov-sky.
I believe there is a C.
C.
decision—isn’t there? a formal one in writing (Politbureau)—“to work at the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Berlin”.
This decision is being sabotaged by Lutovinov and now by Stomonyakov as well.
Why? I don’t know for sure, but I can guess: Lutovinov has accused Lenin of extending “patronage” to Shklovsky (!!).
Some people are dissatisfied with the fact that the Orgbureau decision preventing Shklov-sky from going abroad has been cancelled by the Polit-bureau.
180 An absurd web of intrigue has taken shape.
Shklovsky is absolutely of no use in Russia.
His family (many children, a sick wife) has not adjusted in Russia.
Over here it’s noth-ing but fret and worry.
He is undoubtedly an honest man, a Bolshevik since the first (1905) revolution; Zinoviev, all the Bolsheviks and I knew him personally in Switzer-land.
Chicherin is satisfied with his work abroad.
Krasin too.
The sabotage by Lutovinov (and now by Stomonyakov) is a downright scandalous wrecking of the C.
C.
decision.
When one is dissatisfied, one should lodge a complaint with the plenary meeting or with the Central Control Commission.
That is one’s sacred right.
They have failed to lodge a complaint, but have engaged in secret sabotage, pushing Shklovsky close to thoughts of suicide.
They refuse to see that this amounts to mean, dishonest, underhand harass-ment of the man.
There are thieves all over the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade; Kopp has clearly been breeding thieves.
It looks as if Kopp has to be removed.
That makes it all the more important to value honest men with a knowledge of the language and of commerce.
I ask you to seriously bring home to Stomonyakov (bet-ter in writing?) either through the C.
C.
Secretariat (or—more appropriate perhaps?—by sending to Solts at the C.
C.
C.
) the following: stop your sabotage or it may come to your expulsion from the Party.
Make him apologise to Shklovsky, and stop the sabotage.
Drop me a line.

FRUMKIN 5/VI.
Comrade Frumkin: I blame both the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade (what a scandal!) and you for this absurd affair with the fund for the South-Eastern Economic Council.
181 You did nothing but whimper, although you should have brought your precise proposals to the C.
L.
D.
back in April: 1) such-and-such a calendar programme for the shipment of gold; 2) such-and-such for wool, etc.
What you did, however, was to whimper from April to June.
We now have to complete what has not been done.
A calendar programme of detailed measures, which is elaborated with the greatest precision, must be placed before the C.
L.
D.
by Wednesday (I can appoint the com-mission tomorrow, 6/VI—it can be appointed by agree-ment between the People’s Commissars).
Make arrangements about this with Khinchuk (he seems to know something about trade.
No one at the People’s Commissariat for Food does).
Write me at once whether you can pledge now to get things going and what exactly.
Will you manage to arrange efficient trade with Con-stantinople? Or will you run into another Ancona? 182 intospeculators, swindlers (and bankrupts: there are hordes of them in Constantinople), and merely bring shame upon yourself and the entire “commodity-exchange operation” of the South-Eastern Economic Council? The South-Eastern Economic Council must display more initiative, but also shoulder more responsibility.
(If you are not going there again, get Beloborodov or Kaganovich on the direct line and tell them everything I have written you about; it’s time you got things going and showed something for your effort.
) Let the South-Eastern Economic Council stop whimper-ing and start making timely business proposals to the C.

and taking care not to be late with supervising their ful-filment.

LEZHAVA 5/VI.
Comrade Lezhava: Things are thoroughly bad with the People’s Commissar-iat for Foreign Trade.
During your illness, Krasin once again tried out his weak side: excessive self-assurance, sometimes verging on adventurism.
He seems to say: “I can get away with everything, there is nothing I can’t do.
” He has that sort of trait.
Yet, despite his “good luck”, and his dexterity and skill, and art, I would not wager that one fine day this will not land him in a great scandal with ignominious dismissal.
It’s not right.
Krasin was over here; he saw that you were ill but did nothing.
He left one man, Voikov, who was clearly unfit, rather, unable to cope.
On 3/VI, things at the C.
L.
D.
were close to collapse.
On 25/III, 1921, the C.
L.
D.
decided that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade had the duty to supply the South-Eastern Economic Council with 7 million in gold by 15/IV.
Nothing has been done.
Voikov keeps referring to state-ments he had allegedly heard Krasin make that it is impossible to trade with Constantinople: he says it is full of swindlers.
If Krasin has said this, it will one day land him in the dock.
It was Krasin’s duty either strictly to implement the C.
L.
D.
decision of 25/III, or table a proposal at the C.
C.
to have the C.
L.
D.
decision rescinded, or satisfy the South-Eastern Economic Council in some other way, not through Constantinople (this No.
3 in the hope of his “luck”).
By failing to do either the first, or the second, or the third, Krasin is committing a breach of the law and is dis-rupting all the work.
We can’t have that sort of thing.
I ask you to: 1) send a copy of this (or the original) to Krasin, 2) have a personal talk with Frumkin and Khinchuk, 3) check up personally on the execution of C.
L.
D.
decisions, without relying on Voikov.
4) give serious thought to replacing Voikov by Taratuta or Paikes, or any other person you may find who is an efficient and conscientious executive.
Concerning Serebrovsky and Baku, I very much fear now that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade will repeat the South-East story.
That is something I will absolutely refuse to tolerate.
I propose that Serebrovsky and Rabinovich should be sent the following telegram in my name.
Please let me know at once of your objections or amendments.
“Serebrovsky, Baku; Copies to Rabinovich and Orjonikid-ze, Baku or Tiflis.
“I am extremely anxious about the agreement concluded by Serebrovsky with Socifross, and am surprised that this was reported by Rabinovich, unfortunately, without com-ments or practical proposals, while Serebrovsky himselfhas failed to report it.
184 This agreement is a strange one.
Where is the guarantee that Socifross will not cheat us? How can it be allowed to have a monopoly? I do not at all object to Azvneshtorg and Azneftkom trading directly with Constantinople, I am prepared to support Baku’s autonomy within considerable limits, but we must have guarantees.
Please reply at once whether a detailed list of everything Serebrovsky has bought in Constantinople has been sent by reliable courier; when exactly it was sent, and the details of the agreement and when.
I put Serebrovsky under an obligation to send me a letter with every courier, informing me by telegram of his name and date of departure.
What exactly has now been ordered from Socifross? All three addressees must reply to me by telegram.

Kirpichnikov is an inventor.
He should be allowed to go and sent.
Objections could arise only from the political side: If you have any, let me know them in confidence.
If you have none, be sure to send Kirpichnikov.

You are also slightly to blame for letting 1921 go by.
See that 1922 does not.
Why did you fail to award prizes of 10,000-50,000 rubles in gold for the invention of the dehydration method in Ger-many? You will recall that we had spoken of this before your departure! Is it because you had no money (this should have been placed before the C.
L.

RADCHENKO (Secret) Comrade Radchenko, Central Peat Administration 7/VI.
Dear Ivan Ivanych: I quite understand that it pains you to see how non-Soviet people—some of them possibly even enemies of the Soviet power—are making use of their inventions to profi-teer.
I quite believe you that Kirpichnikov is that kind of man.
Of course, Klasson is not a supporter of ours either.
But the whole point is that while your feeling of indigna-tion is quite legitimate, you must not make the mistake of succumbing to it.
The inventors are not our men, but we must use them.
It is better to let them have more, let them make money, make a killing—so long as we, too, can advance an under-taking which is of exceptional importance for the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
Let’s think out our assignments to these men in greater detail.
Perhaps we can adopt this plan:1) Allow Kirpichnikov to go on the trip, provided pre-cisely specified assignments are carried out; draw up a list of them.
2) Send along with him two or three men who are reliable politically (a worker, one of our engineers, etc.
) as some kind of “commissars”.
Give them precise instructions.
Let us approve § 1 and § 2 by agreement with Krzhizha-novsky.
3) Establish over here in Russia a special centre, order Gidrotorf’s best machines, set up this special centre with these special machines, i.
e.
, a special enterprise, and get it to advance this business in its own way.
Would you find the men to do this? 4) Offer on Glavtorf ’s behalf prizes (10,000-30,000 ru-bles in gold) in Canada and in Germany for the best methods of dehydrating peat, and for the best models of machines for Gidrotorf, etc.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
I wonder why Klasson has failed to award any prizes in Germany, although he and I had spoken about it.
Could he be dragging things out? Perhaps we should do this directly through Glavtorf ? We should spare no money for this.

He was a very valu-able and prominent worker.
Stasova and possibly the Cau-casians (perhaps Yenukidze as well) should know him.

This is necessary.
He knows and thinks (was sehr selten ist unter den Revolutionären * ).
What needs to be done right away is to find one German, a real one, and give him strict instructions to make stylistic corrections at once, and dictate the corrected text to a typist.
And at the congress read out for Kuusinen his article-report (tell Kuusinen to complete the second half within three days).

I scanned it and made some additions (red ink in the text).
Please send me: 1) A calendar programme of the work (not under the best conditions—“ i f ” we are supplied this and that—but under the present); in particular: when the work will be finished.
2) Allocation of the work between the members of the commission.
3) Text and maps, when ready, before they are sent to the printers.
4) Conclusion on the question whether it is desirable and possible to enlist Anuchin and Borzov for this work (for what reasons—in the event of a positive and a negative answer to the questions).
5) Conclusion on whether the members of the commission or its chairman will undertake the additional work de-scribed in the attached copy of my letter to Pavlovich.
Pavlovich has refused.
I have asked a comrade in Germany to do this, but have not yet had his reply.

52 Printed from the original 226 TELEGRAM TO SAMARKAND COMMUNISTS 216 Shafransky, Gubernia Party Committee, Samarkand I thank the group of friends for their greetings.
The main thing just now is an immediate improvement in the conditions of the workers and peasants.
On the vigour and skill of the workers in the localities now depends every-thing: the tax in kind, the development of turnover be-tween agriculture and industry, and the development of small-scale industry.
We have no fear of capitalism, because the proletariat has the power, transport and large-scale industry firmly in its hands and will succeed, through itscontrol, in channeling it into state capitalism.
Under these conditions, capitalism will help to combat red tape and the scattering of the petty producers.
We shall win out because we know what we want.

in favour of the enemies).
Page 2: “the overall reorganisation of the People’s Com-missariats, which is inevitably connected”.
.
.
(“inevitably”? There is nothing inevitable because there is NO overall reorganisation taking place at all.
It turns out that the author refers the reader to the “overall” which does not exist).

.
Everyone is so fed up with assignments that the less said of them the better.
Everyone has a host of assignments.
General, universal, all-encompassing assignments which are clearly not going to be fulfilled.
This has been a partial or even a total failure.
It is better to say nothing in the press for the time being.
But for a report in the C.
L.
D.
(α) bring out clearly something that has been actually achieved, even if it is only three or four small but pre-cise and factual examples, a thing that has been achieved instead of assignments, something that has been concretely implemented instead of the general and the projected.
What has Ramzin done in Petrograd? ” ” Neopikhanov in Moscow? Strumilin Popov and others.
(β) Has the work been allocated to the individual members? When? To how many of the 35? ( γ ) Of the ten commissions of the People’s Commissariats, relations are correct with one (? fuel).
How is this expressed? What are the real achievements in the plan for the second half of 1921? Fuel economies? Conclusion: carry forward the merger with the 10, overcome the inertness of the 9 which are doing nothing? (δ) Prepare plan for the second half of 1921? People’s Commissariat for Agriculture (crop?) Central Statistical Board? Current section Supreme Economic Council That is how, I think, the material should be roughly arranged for a report in the C.
L.
D.
The general and consolidated plan will apparently be ready not earlier than the autumn of 1921, and it cannot be given until the crop is estimated.
Let that be so.
(But the crop is one thing, and the quan-tity of tax collected and grain obtained is another.
You will know this quantity in 1922, post factum.
)This means that we shall still have to proceed from the estimated minimum figures.
The partial plans have been drawn up (fuel?); half com-pleted (People’s Commissariat for Railways?).
I suppose here we can give something factual.
A quarter completed? The number of mouths? (this is the business of the Central Statistical Board and not of Gosplan.
Everyone will be heaping their own work on Gosplan.
It must not let them do it).
But the main thing still is: immediately, right away, “piece by piece” eliminate all the obviously irrational, all that clearly contradicts the state economic plan.
(close down such-and-such establishments in such a branch.

.
close down or half-close down such-and-such railways .

224 I hasten there-fore to inform you in writing: when I was an émigré myself (for more than 15 years), I took “too Leftist” a stand sev-eral times (as I now realise).
In August 1917, I was also an émigré and moved in our Party Central Committee a much too “Leftist” proposal which, happily, was flatly rejected.
225 It is quite natural for émigrés frequently to adopt attitudes which are “too Leftist”.
It has neverentered my mind, now or in the past, to impute this to such fine, loyal, dedicated and worthy revolutionaries as the Hungarian émigrés, who are so much respected by all of us, and by the whole Communist International.

Dear Comrades: I thank you very much for the book you have sent me 2 4 1 and for your friendly letter.
I have read the book with interest.
It will undoubtedly be important for the history of how the Soviet power was organised.
I am sending you a copy of the just published law on the district economic councils and the “Mandate”.
I hope that you will get a statistician in advance, give him the material, verify his work, add to it yourself (together with essays by some other local Rogozhsko-Simonovsky com-rades, if any are willing to write them) and publish next autumn a report on the content and the results of local economic work by your district Soviet of Deputies.
I hope that you will display initiative in this and that your dis-trict will be among the first in developing local economic construction.
I thank you once again, and send you communist greet-ings.

Please let me know without delay how far the things have gone with the purchase abroad of coal-cutting ma-chines for the Donets Basin.
Comrade Smolyaninov has informed me that he has established from his telephone conversations with Comrade Grigoryev that there are some doubts at Glavugol about the proven advisability of making extensive use of coal-cutting machines in the extraction of coal, or at any rate, that the production effect expected by Comrade Pyatakov from the use of coal-cutting machines is exaggerated.
Please let me have absolutely precise and definite infor-mation about Glavugol’s opinion on the advisability of coal-cutting machines in the extraction of coal in the Donets Basin, and on the effect their use in production can have on boosting output.
Also let me know where, and where best, coal-cutting machines can be bought—in Germany or in Britain, and how soon this can be done.

Comrades Richard Müller and Heinrich Malzahn Dear Comrades: I was able to read your letter of 18/VII only today.
243 I have spoken with Comrade Heckert on the question you raised only once and quite briefly.
When he asked what I thought about it, I told him that I was too inadequately informed to judge, that those expelled should of course be organised in some way, and that in this sense Heckert’s proposal seems to be correct.
That is all.
I know nothing about “unions”, or the tactless actions of individual Communists (which made expulsion easier for the social-traitors).
The resolution adopted by the congress (which you have sent me) tells me that the unions are not approved (“insig-nificant”, “diffuse”, “sow confusion”).
The practical slo-gan is: “Do not pull out more workers’ groups from the centralised free unions.
” What is there to be said against it? Moreover, you yourselves hope to secure control of the unions.
I shall send your letter to Comrades Lozovsky and Zino-viev, to obtain fuller information.

I request that ROSTA should send two or three short wires on this subject to inform all gubernia and uyezd towns at once, asking them to carry reprints in all local Party and Soviet newspapers.
I ask the editorial boards of the Moscow papers to send me either cuttings of articles inserted in accordance with my present request or separate issues with articles on this subject, specially underscored.

1921.
Comrade Zinoviev: In view of a number of statements made by Zetkin, I regard the conversation I had with her yesterday, before her departure, to be so important that I must inform you of it.
She wants to set Levi two conditions: 1) resign his parliamentary seat; 2) close down his organ (Sowiet 254 or Unser Weg, as I believe it is now called), issuing a statement of loyaltyin respect of the decisions of the Third Congress of the Communist International.
Furthermore, she is afraid that it could occur to some friend of Levi’s to publish Rosa Luxemburg’s manuscript against the Bolsheviks (which I think she wrote in prison in 1918).
If anyone should do this, she intends to make a statement in the press that she is quite sure such an act is disloyal.
She would say that she had known Rosa Lu-xemburg best of all, and is sure that she herself admitted these views to be erroneous, that she admitted, upon her release from prison, that she had been insufficiently in-formed.
In addition, Léon Jogiches, Rosa Luxemburg’s closest friend, in a detailed talk with Zetkin, two days before he died, told her about this manuscript of Rosa Luxem-burg’s, and about Rosa Luxemburg herself admitting that it was wrong.
255 Zetkin was going to write you about this at my request.
If she has done so, please send me her letter.
Another interesting point, according to her, is that there is a wave of unification of all workers (both S.
D.
P.
and U.
S.
P.
-Leute) in the struggle against Lohnabbau, * etc.
Of course, Zetkin was quite right in saying that the Com-munists should back this unification in the struggle against the capitalists.
If the “Lefts” should object, they should be made to see reason.

Approve in substance.
Ascertain more precisely the amount of the loan, the dates and the terms of repayment in raw materials and tim-ber (first year, in our gold: 30 million rubles in gold; we could make it two years at 30 million rubles in gold).
Ten per cent a year with repayment? Isn’t that too much? Etwa: Krasin.

Copy to Comrade Krzhizhanovsky I thank you very much for the article, “Electrification of Russia” in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn of 10/VII.
259 It is highly important that such information should appear in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn and in the popular press from time to time.
If you happen to have it, please send me the following additional information: 1) your table shows the electric-power station capacity in 1920 as being 7.
670 kw.
Does this include Shatura’s 5,000 kw? 2) Your article shows that in 1920 the Tula group yield-ed 3,000 kw.
Is that reflected in the table, or is such in-formation not included? 3) Is it possible to bring out the larger stations which are of real industrial importance, say, those of 1,000 kw or those of a size which could be classed as large and which are of importance to industry? 4) For how many months of 1921 do you have consoli-dated tables in which 1921 is shown at all? 5) Do you happen to have any details on the early stages of organisation of the Shterovka, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Nizhni-Novgorod and Chelyabinsk stations? 6) Your article says that the combination of several large stations could give Moscow 10,000 kw.
Please let me know whether it has actually done so, exactly how much and when? 7) Could you let me have some details about the power stations in Bolshevo district, near Mytishchi, and the Detskoye Selo station, which supplies Petrograd, and more exact information about the time of their expected comple-tion? Please let me know also whether the forthcoming Electro-technical Congress in October 2 6 0 could be used to collect fuller and more precise information about all the existing electrotechnical stations, their distribution by uyezd and gubernia, the time of their establishment, the number ofstations being used to teach electricity and electrification, etc.

MARTENS Martens I have received a telegram from Riga about the con-gress of societies in the United States and Canada for tech-nical aid to Soviet Russia, which Golos Rossii 262 of New York says was held there early in July.
263 According to this report, the congress sent a telegram of greetings to Martens and the People’s Commissars, and announced in this telegram its decision to start organising technical teams for dispatch to Soviet Russia right away.
I think I should send them a telegram on these lines: “Having learned from the New York Golos Rossii about your congress and its telegram of greetings to Soviet Russia, I express, on behalf of the C.

“Let me add, on my own behalf: we are greatly in need of technical aid from the United States and Canada.
If teams are to be sent without agreement in advance concern-ing the place of settlement, factory, etc.
, the team must have a two-year supply of food, clothing, etc.
Each team must be prepared to do both agricultural and industrial work.

Comrade Frumkin: The whole thing now seems to hinge on the speedy col-lection of the tax in kind.

e.
, assign them to food sup-ply work? 2) the same thing, especially in Moscow and neighbour-ing gubernias? 3) feed these units (and food detachments, which I think now have some different name: “militia promoting the collec-tion of the tax in kind” or something like that?) at the expense of the local peasants at two pounds a day< or three pounds a day< You don’t want this, comrades peasants, do you? Let’s have the grain tax fast.
As soon as you deliver 50-75 per cent, we shall start pulling them out! 4) pass a resolution (or perhaps, instead of a “resolu-tion ” , stage an experiment and set up a model in Moscow Gubernia); mete out instant, exemplary and highly severe punish-ment to 10 of the richest peasants per volost for any delay, however slight, over the tax in kind or for slack delivery of the tax in kind; — — — ditto—mete out exemplary punishment to one volost per uyezd, or two-three per gubernia, for slack de-liveries of the tax in kind? 5) issue a bonus for 100 per cent collection of tax (grain) within two or three weeks.
Bonus in what form? In gold or silver things.
We can get them at the State Depository of Valuables.
6) make an effort to mobilise for the collection of the tax in kind in Moscow Gubernia another 2 or 3 hundred of the most responsible Party members, if only for raids (check-ups, pressure) twice a week? With communist greetings, Lenin P.

Lenin I consider the plan correct and subject to immediate ap-proval.
Perhaps it may be desirable to have some further specifications and additions, such as: 1) let them have the circulating capital in gold, but only from our export earnings for 1921, charging the group in question to expedite the realisation of this export; 2) specify with greater precision the “leased” area for the given group, taking mostly, or even exclusively, the very far north (this is more convenient for us, because it will spare us the need to send food over there; it is more con-venient politically, because the preferential terms for the workers—up to 50 kopeks in gold!!—will cause less envy and fewer collisions among the other workers); 3) give more precise definitions of the group’s obligations: fulfil no less than a given programme (both in production and in export in 1922 and especially 1923); 4) bind the “group” to try to abide by the interests ofelectrification (buy more foreign equipment for the electric-power stations, make use of saw-dust, etc.
)—the interests of Russia’s fuel supply (fuel branch-lines; increased sup-plies of fuel and firewood to Moscow, etc.
); 5) let the group have what it asks in the sphere of finan-cial and material independence.

K.
VLADIMIROV ON AUGUST 6, 1921 (Moscow-Kharkov) Vladimirov: We have established high rates in the Ukraine on the west bank of the Dnieper.
This entails heavy risks.
We are taking the following measures: to involve the volost economic conferences in the work of discussing a number of questions of interest to the coun-tryside, but we are simultaneously faced with the question of salt, considering its present shortage.
The question comes to this: are we to give salt regardless of the payment of tax (this is official), actual-ly, however, giving it first of all to those volosts which have success-fully started to collect the tax; let me add that I think it right to sell for ready cash even now.
Let me have your opinion.
Lenin: First: I advise the sale of salt only for grain, and not for cash in any case.
Second: Sell salt only to those volosts, villages or individ-ual farmers who have paid in at least a quarter or half the tax.
Third: I think that the successful collection of tax re-quires military units to help it, with these military units receiving larger rations at the expense of the local peasants, until the tax has been paid.
Fourth: Let me know what the food situation is in the Donbas, how well it is supplied, and for how long.
Vladimirov: On the first two questions I maintain the same stand.
Concerning military force, please have a talk with Frunze, who has gone to Moscow.
As for the Donbas, we have four routes for it.
We are taking steps to get some locomotives.
I believe we shall be able to start regular supplies not later than the 12th.
Lenin: Maintaining the first stand is not enough.
You must have a formal C.
C.
decision.
If you cannot obtain it from your C.
C.
you must get it through the C.
C.

The same applies to the rules of using armed force.
Concerning the Donbas, let me have the briefest and most precise reports twice a week about the quantity of foodstuffs in hand.
Vladimirov: I think this matter can be best decided with Rakov-sky and Frunze, who have gone to Moscow.
My opinion is on record.

L.
D.
a calendar programme of their re-ceipt at once.
The same about grain.
We are sending Comrade Joffe in an attempt to settle your differences with Comrade Safarov.
I believe the two tendencies can and must be combined: 1) the first priority is grain and meat for Moscow; 2) (for this) a number of concessions and bonuses to the “merchants “; 3) no question about the new economic policy (10th Con-gress, Conference of May 1921, etc.
); 4) Moslem poor peasants’ committees indispensable, and 5) the Moslem poor should be treated with care and pru-dence, with a number of concessions.
It is possible and necessary to combine and consolidate the line of wisdom and prudence, maintaining the interests of our “world policy” throughout the East.

Comrade Molotov: It is absolutely necessary to appoint a special commis-sion from the Politbureau: Kamenev Trotsky Molotov (with the right of his substitution by Chiche-rin) for the day-to-day handling of matters connected with aid to the starving from America and the League of Nations.
This game is an extremely intricate one.
There is rank duplicity on the part of America, Hoover and the League of Nations Council.
Hoover must be punished, he must be slapped in the face publicly, for all the world to see, and the League of Nations Council as well.
This is very hard to do, but it must be done.
I can’t work.
There is absolute need of help from Trotsky, who has a capacity for these things (both diplo-matic experience and a military and political instinct).
Please have a vote taken in the Politbureau at once by telephone.
Show this note to everyone and get their votes.
Lenin The German and Norwegian governments could be taken as models.
Any other approach should be rejected with a motivation which is clear to all, and this should be loudly proclaimed to the whole world.
The disguised interventionists must be caught (have Unschlicht help out).
The Kompomoshch * apparatus must be tightened up (if there is a shortage of men, borrow some from the military for two months).

Has there been an adequate statement of the legal side of the matter, i.

These en-terprises and warehouses could pass into the hands of their former owners only through their formally buying these warehouses from us.
We may sometimes make a concession by letting them have these enterprises and warehouses at a low price, but we can never waive our right in the property.
Please have this matter verified with especial care from the said angle.
It is my special request that the verification should be carried out at the People’s Commissariat for Justice, where Kursky himself was informed of and handled the matter, and it is necessary either to look for Kursky or find someone at the People’s Commissariat for Justice who is at least as knowledgeable as Kursky.

I propose that we should immediately telegraph them officially, on behalf of the government, over the signatures of Kamenev and Chicherin (and if necessary Kalinin’s and mine as well), the following: we shall deposit with a New York bank an amount in gold constituting 120 per cent of what they will supply in the course of a month for one million starving children and sick persons.
But in that case, considering such a complete material guarantee, we stipulate that the Americans must absolutely refrain not only from political but also from ad-ministrative interference, and must make no claims what-soever.
This means that in that case all the terms of the treaty giving them the least right to interfere even if only administratively shall be void.
On-the-spot check-ups are to be made by parity commissions (representing our govern-ment and them).
277 This proposal will show the hucksters just where they stand, and subsequently disgrace them in the eyes of the whole world.
We should not forget that we have never had rationing of any kind in the countryside.
If we are to make no mis-take on this score, I suggest we invite someone from the People’s Commissariat for Food to discuss the matter.

Dear Comrade Rothstein: I received your letter of 17/VII only yesterday.
I seem to be in full agreement with your circumspect policy in Persia.
I have not heard the “other side”, but I do not think that your main considerations could be refuted.
Why don’t you write a work on Persia, to give us all achance to make a study of such an interesting subject, which is so obscure for all of us? It is extremely important to elaborate a line of work in the East.
I write no more, as you will know the news from the newspapers, I am now on holiday: I have overworked and am taking a cure.
I hope that Belgov has already reached you.
With him I wrote you about Alexander Alexandrovich and Varvara Alexandrovna Armand, who went with him, and about whom I am very anxious.
I hope that they will prove to be useful in Persia, and that you will be able to de-vote some little time to them.
My best regards and wishes.

282 What in my opinion is the main thing is not to be found in the draft at all, namely, a number of immediate practical meas-ures for the stricter guarding of salt in the hands of the state, and for a maximum reduction of all manner of issues of salt to industrial and office workers, urban residents and all the population in general.
This last measure must be put through, at least for the current autumn and the early winter, in the harshest proportions, as otherwise we shall not get any grain from the peasants in exchange for salt.

It is of exceptional importance for us to arrange things in such a way that the concessionaire, who wants to take over nearly all the copper mines in Russia, should, first, guarantee our royalties and our early receipt of them, and, second, that we should have the possibility of obtaining from the con-cessionaire the necessary equipment to develop the opera-tion of our own mines.
After you have studied the matter, please inform me to what extent you believe the one and the other condition are guaranteed, and what is in general the importance of the proposed concession from the stand-point of developing Russia’s supply and her electrification in particular.

Is it possible to find and send me my preface to the German edition of my book on imperialism? * I sent the preface to Petrograd a year ago.

I am very anxious about whether our slogan of col-lecting donations in aid of Russia only directly to our address, i.

—Ed.
ers’ press in general, and in the communist press in par-ticular.
We signed an agreement with the American Secretary of Commerce, Hoover, in Riga on Saturday (do not publish anything about this yet) and Harding has been calling on the American people to send in all donations through Hoover.
It would be extremely important for the Comintern to put forward a definite slogan, without coming out against the American Government for the time being, saying that the workers should send in their donations only directly to the address of Soviet Russia’s representatives abroad.
For any donations sent through the bourgeois govern-ments necessarily carry for us, directly or indirectly, to a greater or lesser extent, some sort of strings, whereas the workers will undoubtedly agree to send their donations to us without any strings, and this is a distinction of tremen-dous importance for us.
Is it possible to check whether the Comintern and the trade union press sympathising with us have accepted the need to send in donations to the Soviet Government’s ad-dress without any strings, and to start a broad campaign to have all workers set aside a day’s earnings in aid of the famine-stricken in Russia?

SMILGA AND ASSIGNMENT TO SECRETARY Very urgent 22.
VIII.
21.
Comrade Smilga: I think that one of the gross mistakes in the Donbas, i.
e.
, in all the effort to rehabilitate the Donbas, is that there is no proper co-ordination of local work—industrial, agricultural and commercial.
There seems to have been some friction, on the one hand, between Pyatakov and Rukhimovich, and on the other, between Pyatakov and the local trade unions.
I consider it extremely important for you not to confine yourself to purely industrial matters, relating only to the coal-mining industry, but to devote attention to the need to eliminate the above-mentioned friction.
It is necessary, at all costs, to get the gubernia economic conference of Donets Gubernia working intensively and har-moniously.
Special measures should be taken to have Pyatakov and all his apparatus direct their efforts to raise local agricul-ture and carry on trade with the peasants, and with foreign countries via Taganrog.
In particular, attention should be given to measures to boost local agriculture by introducing irrigation through the use of the Donets River sluice-gates.
This plan, which promises to be highly practicable, has been put forward at Gosplan.
In general, it is quite wrong for the coal-mining industry administration to regard itself as being unconnected with agriculture in Donets Gubernia.
I am sure that if the forces of the labour army, which are available in Donets Gubernia, as well as the forces of local miners and the coal-mining industry administration, were to be thrown into the joint endeavour with the workers of Donets Gubernia, it would be possible to secure not only the earliest collection of the tax in kind, but also to ac-quire undoubtedly large quantities of foodstuffs through a correctly organised commodity exchange, both an ex-change of goods for salt, and of grain for coal.
I’ll be expecting you to send me, first, a telegram con-taining a short notification that you have received this letter and that you will do your utmost in this direction, and, second, a detailed communication on the constitution and work of the gubernia economic conference of Donets Gubernia after your arrival.
Concerning the coal-cutting machines about which Pya-takov wrote, I have a precise and detailed report from spe-cialists saying that even the coal-cutting machines already available in the Donbas cannot be put to use for a num-ber of reasons, and that it is quite impractical to buy newcoal-cutting machines, because these machines will be doomed to lie idle.
Please make a circumstantial study of this question with the help of real specialists who have a thoroughly good knowledge of the business.

Comrade Stalin: Nansen’s most brazen proposal (to appoint a Cadet from the Relief Committee), 289 the behaviour of these “Kukishi” and the enclosed telegram clearly reveal that we have made a mistake, or if we did not make one earlier, we are go-ing to blunder badly unless we keep our eyes peeled.
You will recall that Rykov, shortly before he left, came and told me that someone called Runov, one of our men,had informed him about a meeting at which Prokopovich had held forth against the government.
The meeting had been arranged by Prokopovich, who had used the Famine Relief Committee as a screen.
What else is there to wait for now? Are we going to tolerate their obvious preparations? This is absolutely inconceivable.
I propose: this very day, Friday, 26/8, “Kukishi” should be dissolved by a decision of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
—motive: their refusal to work and their resolution.
Ap-point one man from the All-Russia Cheka to take over the money and to supervise the liquidation.
Prokopovich should be arrested this very day on a charge of anti-government speech-making (at a meeting attend-ed by Runov) and detained for about three months, while we make a thorough investigation of the meeting.
The other members of “Kukishi” should be expelled from Moscow at once, this very day, and settled singly in uyezd towns, preferably without railways, under surveil-lance.
Really and truly it would be a bad mistake to wait any longer.
The whole thing will be done before Nansen leaves.
Nansen will be faced with a clear “ultimatum”.
That will be an end to this playing (with fire).
Not later than tomorrow we shall publish five lines of a short dry “government communique” dissolved because of unwillingness to work.
290 We shall issue an order to the newspapers: the same day, tomorrow, start ridiculing “Kukishi” in a hundred ways.
These whiteguards and sons of the landed gentry wanted to take a trip abroad and refused to go and work in the localities.
Kalinin has gone, but the Cadets find it “un-befitting”.
They should be ridiculed and harassed in every possible way at least once a week in the course of two months.
The sore tooth will be extracted right away, and with great benefit in every respect.
There must be no wavering.
I suggest that we get this thing over and done with at the Politbureau today.
Foreigners will start arriving, and Moscow should be “cleared” of the “Kukishi”, and their playing (with fire) should be stopped.
Show this to the members of the Polit-bureau.

Everything that you have reported about the conditions of economic work will be discussed by me in connection with all the ma-terial available over here.
Your recall from Siberia is ap-parently to be put off until the work of purging the Party is over.

Radchenko, Krasin, and Gosplan Presidium I have received and read your report of August 31.
If the news you report that you have fully solved the problem of the industrial dehydration of peat is quite true, this is of tremendous importance.
It is necessary at once to carry out a check-up or a technical expertise and then to settle the question of allocating to you the requested foodstuffs and foreign currency.
You must let us know how much food and foreign currency you are requesting.
I am surprised at your communication that the powers conferred upon you by the C.
P.

had been withdrawn long ago, because no one could have done that.
Please arrange a conference with the participation of Comrade Radchenko, a representative of the State Planning Commission, Smolyaninov and Krasin.
296 Since Krasin is leaving on September 7, it is desirable to have thingsfinished before he goes.
The assignment to the conference is to take measures to verify your report and to determine the amount of foodstuffs and foreign currency to be issued, together with the terms of issue.

If you have the time, you will find out (from the state-ment.

.
.
.
It pains me very much to waste your valuable time, but I have decided to do so only because of my strong convic-tion that the Volkhov installation must be completed as soon as possible at all costs.
NB NB Urgent Comrade Gorbunov: Will you undertake this business (or pass it to Smolyani-nov by agreement with him).

GORBUNOV Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars .

In fulfilling the duties assigned to the central and local financial organs, they have recently been coming up against exceptionally unfavourable obstacles, chiefly the fact that the executive organs of the Soviet power have completely forgotten the in-junctions of the Constitution on the drawing up of estimates and the making of expenditures in accor-] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] dance with them, which is having an extremely harm-ful effect on the general state of the budget, and is _ ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] the cause of exceptional upheavals in the system of monetary circulation.
To illustrate this, one need merely point out the following circumstances: 1) in some districts, wages are issued to workers not in accordance with the tariff rates, but at free market prices, sometimes amounting to as much as 700,000 rubles per man a day (Privolzhsk district, and the western and eastern gu-bernias); 2) actors and workers of Soviet theatres are remunerated not according to tariff salaries, but with additions, coming to many hundreds of per cent over and above the latter (besides, under the estimates of the People’s Commissariat for Education the cost of _ ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] NBmaintenance of the theatres comes to 29,000 million, |||| and of institutions of higher education, to 17,000 |||| outra-geous!! million); 3) it has become commonplace, and very much the rule for Soviet institutions and enterprises to purchase the things they need on the free market and, naturally, at its prices.

The Politbureau yesterday adopted a decision * which has been sent to you.
I believe that responsible persons should be appointed for each country, or group of countries, to follow the labour press of various parties, taking down the exact figures, and naturally, confining themselves only to: 1) the results of the collection of donations; 2) exact indication of currency in which the donations have been made; 3) indication of date on which the donations have been collected; and 4) name of newspapers from which information has been taken, and the party or organisation making the collection.
There is need to bring out under a separate head any resolutions by parties and trade unions about one-day wage contributions.
I should very much like to have a reply about what exactly has been done by the Executive Committee and when we could hope to have the first summarised results.

CHICHERIN 5/IX.
Comrade Chicherin: I attach no importance to Berzin’s opinion about the decline of the British labour movement.
316 Berzin knows little and is always “pessimistic”.
I am very much worried about the search of his luggage.
I think we should make a strict application of the “eye for an eye” rule to British representatives.
Pedantically: treat them just as badly and a little worse.
Is this being done? Then, concerning the “Hooverites”, 317 their every step should be watched (by the People’s Commissariat for For-eign Affairs through the press and perhaps some “ties”); while the worst of them (someone called Lowrie?) “tracked down” and caught, so as to land them in a scandal.
This calls for relentless, persistent warfare.
Do all our representatives abroad know that everything should be done to support workers’ collections (in aid of the starving) directly to us? Send a dispatch (circular) with this demand: their every report must state in code: “workers’ collections in Britain (France, Sweden, etc.
) for fortnight so much.
” Collections only straight to our address.
We must have prompt, accurate and regular information about this; The “for Nansen” and “against Nansen” campaign 3 1 8 clearly shows (the extracts from the Daily Chronicle which you have sent me are extremely interesting) that we must reply to Noulens with a strictly sharp rejection: an out-right rejection.
Then and only then shall we gain by win-ning over the “pro-Nansen” elements and put an end to the game of the anti-Nansenites.

ZINOVIEV Comrade Zinoviev: I have received the eight drafts of the People’s Com-missariat for Education which you have sent me.
320 I can-not agree with you that this should not be a matter of urgency or that there is anything wrong in the drafts.
I am afraid that you have not taken enough care to read them.
There is nothing in the drafts about applying the commercial principle to the schools.
There is only a point about attracting the local population, especially peasants,to participation in the maintenance of schools.
I believe this to be absolutely correct, and certainly an urgent ne-cessity.
Of course, amendments may be required on some particulars, and these could be made during the discussion of the draft, but I repeat that they are essentially quite correct.
Signs of anything like the commercial principle can be found in the eighth draft only, namely, the right to organise and lease enterprises to supply institutions of the People’s Commissariat for Education.
But even this draft, and it is the one which you have failed to underline, I con-sider to be absolutely correct, because without such meas-ures it is impossible to improve the maintenance of schools, or to alleviate the starving of teachers.
I absolutely fail to see where you have spotted any relaxation of the prin-ciple of retaining the schools in our hands.
I have found nothing to that effect in the points you have underscored, nor in the eighth project, in particular.
More and more should be taken from the peasants for the maintenance of local schools.

Chairman for all Departments and Branches of Industry, Copy to Central Statistical Board One of the most important tasks of economic construc-tion, and undoubtedly the most pressing one just now, is to reduce the number of establishments and enterprises on state supply.
Only a minimum of the largest, the bestequipped and organised enterprises, factories, plants and mines should be left on state supply, with strict verifica-tion of available resources.
You are hereby ordered imme-diately to carry out another check-up and to make another reduction in the number of enterprises on state supply; draw up right away a list of enterprises being left on state supply, and send it on to the C.

1921 Comrade Joffe: You will find that today’s Politbureau decision (which I enclose) largely meets your dispatch of 9/IX.
328 Please be so kind as to send me a written report with more details.
In addition, as a personal request, to enable me to sort things out in this matter, I ask you to devote special attention (in your report or in a special annex to your report) to the question of protection of native interests against “Russian” (Great-Russian or colonialist) exaggera-tions.
What is the attitude of the natives to Safarov? Facts, facts and more facts.
Who are the natives themselves (Safarov’s supporters)? Names? Record? Prestige? (Facts, facts.
.
.
.
) Will they be able to stand up for themselves? Is that sure? Even against such a subtle and firm and stubborn man as Tomsky? How many of them are there? “The Union of the Poor” (set up by Safarov?)—its com-position? importance? strength? role? Is it true that the natives were “forcibly” stratified? Cotton? Its future? Is it true that Safarov is ruining the cotton? Facts, facts.
The fronts in Ferghana? The Basmachi? Their attitude to the Tomsky and the Safarov “line”? Facts and exact decisions by Turkestan C.
E.
C.
concerning the Basmachi? The facts on what and when Tomsky and Safarov or their supporters differed in this question? (Extracts from relevant decisions, to show exactly when and on what precisely the formal differences occurred.
) There are some differences on this question inside the C.
C.
More exact information is highly important.
I personally very much suspect “Tomsky’s line” (perhaps it would be more correct to say Peters’s line? or Pravdin’s line? etc.
) of engaging in Great-Russian chauvinism, or, to put it more correctly, in deviating in that direction.
It is terribly important for all our Weltpolitik * to win the confidence of the natives; to win it over again and again; to prove that we are not imperialists, that we shall not tolerate any deviation in that direction.
This is a world-wide question, and that is no exaggera-tion.
There you must be especially strict.
It will have an effect on India and the East; it is no joke, it calls for exceptional caution.

These are my instructions: 1) on every document or package which I hand in for dispatch, a personal check-up must be made by the secre-tary on duty (who must leave a deputy, if she goes away, and who must make arrangements with the telephone operators on 24-hour duty, about a substitute); 2) check up to see whether all the inscriptions are there (personal delivery; urgent; signature on envelope, etc.

OSINSKY Comrade Osinsky, People’s Commissariat for Agriculture Please urgently inform me about the arrangements for the distribution of seeds in the famine-stricken gubernias, stating: 1) The principles of distribution of seeds among the population (whether they are issued to everyone or only to those whose land has been prepared for sowing, whether inspection of the ploughed-up area has been organised and how, etc.
).
2) Actual participation by organs of the People’s Com-missariat for Agriculture in accepting delivery of the seedfreights, their storage, their transportation from the rail-way stations to the localities, sorting of seeds, and, if information is available, the pace of work in moving the seeds from the central points of delivery to the localities.
3) Whether and how the inventory of the delivered seeds has been organised (are there any lists, stating the names— of persons or collectives—receiving the seeds, and the quantities).
4) Whether and how control has been organised to verify whether the seeds are actually used for sowing and not for food.
The question of correct distribution of seeds is of espe-cial importance.
Meanwhile, Judging by K.
Myaskov’s item, entitled “The Spring and Autumn Sowing Campaigns”, in Izvestia VTsIK No.

1921 Comrade Kuibyshev: I have just had a visit from Rutgers, Calvert and Heywood representing the American workers’ colony group who wish to take the Nadezhdinsk Works and several enter-prises in the Kuznetsk basin.
336They want their representative (with an interpreter) to attend the Council of Labour and Defence on Friday.
I think we should let them come.
I also draw your attention to and request you to inform all members of the commission and subcommissions of the following: (1) The Nadezhdinsk Works, in their opinion, is both economically and technically connected with a group of enterprises in Kuzbas, for it will provide tractors for their farms; tractors and all other farming implements for the peasants; repair of machinery for their group’s enterprises in Kuzbas; equipment for water transport communications with Siberia, etc.
(2) In Kuznetsk basin they are taking 12,000 dessiatines of land and several enterprises, wishing to set up a large and complete economic whole.
(3) They want only 300,000 dollars in cash.
It would be wrong to think otherwise.
(4) In addition, they want grain and clothing, in order to start the necessary building operations at once.
They say work should be started this very winter to have time to finish it by the spring of 1922.
(5) They stress that they will have a firm administrative set-up for their workers’ group; and the whole group (3,000-6,000 workers) selected from among the best workers, mostly young and unmarried men, who have had practical experience in their line, and have lived in a climate simi-lar to that of Russia (Canada and the Northern United States).
(6) They want to be directly subordinate to the Council of Labour and Defence.
Something like an autonomous state trust consisting of a workers’ association.
They say, by the way, that 200 American lumberjacks are living here in the “émigré house”.
Most of them are without work.
They are itching to get to work.
They say that if you send about 30 of them to the Nadezhdinsk Works and 15 to Kuznetsk basin at once—with full equipment and food, they will start building log cabins immediately.
(The rest of the 200 will go there later.
) They want us to hurry up with sending them off.
They say that Gerbek (? I did not quite catch the Englishpronunciation of the name) from the Urals Industrial Bu-reau had agreed to their plan verbally, and the Siberians (the Siberian Industrial Bureau), in writing.
They intend to take along 10-15 per cent of Russian-speaking workers.
They could take more.
Please take all this into account.

Within two or three weeks, the autumn slush and total lack of roads will halt the transportation of the stock-piled fuel from the forests until the sleigh-roads can be used.
Meanwhile, the quantity of firewood available at the railway lines at present and that to be brought out under the plan of the Chief Timber Committee in the brief period of transportation remaining fall very far short of the quantity required for the normal operation of transport.

That is why, all energy, resources and facilities must be strained to the utmost in the gubernias through which these key railway lines run, in order to achieve the maximum results.
Vigorous execution is hereby declared to be the personal responsibility of chairmen of the gubernia executive com-mittees, chairmen of the gubernia timber committees, and chairmen of the gubernia Cheka, in accordance with Soviet and Party procedures.

ZINOVIEV Comrade Zinoviev: The three of us (Molotov, Stalin and I), in our capacity as a commission appointed by the C.
C.
, have discussed your letter.
We still cannot agree with you.
In Moscow, there were major differences on principle, there was the Workers’ Opposition, which the Party Congress condemned for its “deviation”, one which was notonly on a Moscow but on an all-Russia scale, with a long history behind it.
In Petrograd, there are no differences on principle, nor is there even a deviation towards a deviation.
There is nothing of the sort about Komarov or Uglanov, who were most reliable at the Tenth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
and at the metalworkers’ congress as well.
These comrades could not have plunged into a deviation so suddenly.
We find not a trace of the facts to prove this.
There is a legitimate desire on the part of a majority to be the majority and to substitute another group for the one through which you have been “running things”.
The people have gained in stature and that alone makes their desire legitimate.
They should not be pushed into a deviation by talk of “differences on principle”.
Ideological guidance should be exercised carefully, fully allowing the new majority to be a majority and to run things.
We are sure that if you want this you could very well do it, and help the “old group” to move to another city and refresh themselves.

The stealing of firewood is very widespread (and this is understandable in a cold ruined peasant country).
Bureaucrats and contractors very frequently cover up this stealing and carry it through “artistically”.
It is extremely important to make a much more detailed study from below of the methods of cheating (from entries in the books, receipts, etc.

The main task that Forlitcom should set itself is to have the special libraries in Moscow, Petrograd and the major cities of the Republic concentrate in their hands one copy each of all the latest technical and scientific (chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, medicine, statistics, econom-ics, etc.
) magazines and books for 1914-1921 published abroad, and to have regular receipt of all periodicals ar-ranged.
I shall appraise the whole of Forlitcom’s work primarily from the standpoint of the actual fulfilment of this assignment.
By the way: a) the report says that Forlitcom has decided to transfer all credits from all the departments to Forlitcom’s account.
Has this decision been carried out? How much credit has been received from each department? b) Page 3 of the report says: “The boxes with scientific and technical literature tended to contain a mass of whatwas absolutely not important or remarkable in any way— fiction and expensive de luxe editions, purchased no one knows whom for (for private persons) as a personal favour.
” This is an incredible outrage and a crime.

Accordingly, I categorically reaffirm earlier instructions on dates of information reports, and propose that you should raise the information apparatus up to the mark and, by way of urgent order, within 48 hours from the receipt of this tele-gram, telegraph the following information: 1) the approved area under winter crops; 2) the area under winter crops sown; 3) the number of dessiatines left for winter fallowing; 4) the quantity of seeds received under warrants from the centre and through commodity exchange; 5) the quantity of seeds actually distributed; 6) the distribution procedures; 7) measures taken to save livestock, results achieved; 8) meas-ures taken to save dead stock, results achieved; 9) planned social activity, its implementation; 10) state of resettle-ment; 11) state of village committees, their participation in overall work.

The drought has almost entirely scorched the cereals and the grasses everywhere from Astrakhan Gubernia and all the way up to the Tatar Republic and Perm Gubernia.
Millions of people—toiling peasants and workers—and millions of head of cattle are already dying or are about to die.
Russian and Moslem, nomad and settler—all are equally faced with cruel death unless help comes from their com-rades—workers, toiling peasants, shepherds and fishermen from the more prosperous localities.
Of course, the Soviet power, for its part, hastens to help the starving.
It has already urgently sent them more than 12 million poods of grain for winter sowing, and is now sending them food, organising eating places, etc.
But all of this is not enough.
The disaster is so great, and the Soviet Republic has been so ruined by the tsarist war and the whiteguards, thathardly a quarter of the needy can somehow be fed from state resources until the next harvest.
Nor can we expect help from the wealthy capitalists.
It is true that the capitalists who now govern the strongest states in the world—like Britain, America and France— have told us that they allegedly want to help our starving peasants, but on terms which are tantamount to handing over to them all power over our Workers’ and Peasants’ Republic.
We can well understand this.
Has a bloodsucker, a capitalist and a usurer, ever helped a toiler without expect-ing something in return? The capitalist class has always used the toiling man’s hunger to enslave him, body and soul.
They now want to make use of our famine to destroy the freedom we have won at the price of our blood, to wrest power from the workers and peasants for ever, and to saddle them once again with the tsar, the landowner, the master, the police officer and the official.
The only hope of the starving in Kazan, Ufa, Samara and Astrakhan lies in the great proletarian solidarity (sym-pathy) of toiling men, like themselves, with toil-hardened hands, earning their daily bread by their own hard work, and not sucking anyone’s blood.
You have a good catch of fish on the Aral Sea, and you will be able to live without great need.
So please set aside part of your catch for the old men and women bloated by starvation, for the 8 mil-lion exhausted toilers, who, after all, will have to do all the heavy work in tilling the land on an empty stomach for almost a whole year, and finally, for the 7 million chil-dren who may be the first to die.
Dear comrades, fishermen and workers of the Aral Sea, I urge you to give with a generous hand! In so doing you will not only be acting in human conscience, but will be strengthening the cause of the working-class revolution.
For you will demonstrate to the whole world, and to al] the working people above all, the invincible strength of the Soviet workers’ state, built on the broadest mutual assistance between proletarians in areas most remote from each other.
Let the whole working class rise as a man to heal this deep wound of the Volga area, and the fertile Volga area will repay us with its grain in future years.
That is the only way for us to preserve the Soviet power and safeguard the freedom we have won against all the villainous attempts of the capitalists of the world.

The flight is especially strong among coal-hewers, whose numbers dropped from 16,000 to 10,000 in August, and also among skilled boiler-men.
The food supply situation in the Donbas has now been stabilised, namely, a three months’ supply of grain has been delivered and is to be increased.
I propose that you start extensive agitation for a return to the pits of the underground workers who have left Don-bas, namely, coal-hewers, sledders, timberers, drillers, drift-ers, haulers, and also boiler-men and machinists.
No need to send workers others than those in the stated categories.
In conducting agitation explain: 1) full provision of grain; 2) introduction of new rules of payment in food and cash by productivity, and abolition of levelling issues of food and money; 3) on the return of the workers largely depends the success of the food campaign in the Ukraine, which had been slowed down by a shortage of fuel for food trans-portation.

Comrade Molotov: I have an arrangement with Comrade Unschlicht to de-lay execution of the sentence on Nazvanov, and am taking the question to the Politbureau.
In the summer of 1921, I had a letter about Nazvanov from Krasin (before Nazvanov’s arrest).
Krasin requested that this very valuable engineer, as he put it, should be recruited for our work.
Krzhizhanovsky told me that he, being acquainted with Nazvanov, had repeatedly had sharp arguments with him after 25.
X.
1917, and had very nearly thrown him out of the house for his anti-Soviet views.
He said, however, that in the spring or summer of 1921 he had noticed a change in Nazva-nov, and had taken him to work at the State Planning Com-mission.
After this I had two comrades from the C.
C.
of the sugar industry workers who, in reply to my question, gave a positive opinion of Nazvanov, an opinion which theyconfirmed in writing as well.
On the strength of the afore-mentioned, I am taking the matter to the Politbureau.
I propose: if necessary, Krasin’s letter and a written reference of the two workers should be found.
I shall find both these documents if the Politbureau so decides.
For my part I propose: to cancel the Petrograd Guber-nia Cheka’s sentence and apply the sentence proposed by Agranov (it is here in the record of the case), i.
e.

361 I consider the matter of exceptional importance and urgency, because to conclude a loan with Italy, which is not demanding recognition of the old debts, might mean a break through the financial blockade.
I propose a secret commission from the Politbureau right away with a short term (2-4 days).
Let us say, with the following on it: Litvinov, Scheinman, Radchenko, Kres-tinsky (with the right of his substitution by another mem-ber of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Finance), and Bogdanov (with the same right).
The guarantee may be: timber (concession in the north); oil on the Ukhta; oil on the Emba; copper mines, etc.

RUKHIMOVICH 363 11/X.
Comrade Rukhimovich: I have read your report and am cursing you most severely.
The report is done carelessly.
Why not take 2 or 3 hours here in Moscow (if you had no time in the Donbas) to put it into good shape? It is unfinished and unclear.
The required table is not there, but the report itself is cluttered up with figures.
There is need for a short table: the price in terms of flour or in gold rubles, etc.
1,000 poods of coal net at the pit head or at the station, etc.
Before the war.
.
.
——— Now at the Central Board of the Coal Industry— — — — — (big pits).
There again, on the condition you mentioned (complete success of the whole programme of collective sup-ply?)——— — At small pits of leaseholders———— The whole point is to have such a table! Yet that is the one you have failed to give.
All your tables should be in a special little chapter, giving the details and precise proof of the main and basic table.
Furthermore, there is no clear statement: the authori-ties (name, record, rank?) say the small pits are harmful.
So-and-so (names, etc.
) are against this.
This is important, but it has been glossed over.
Thirdly, the conclusion? You should take what is con-troversial.
The leasing of small pits? This is now beyond doubt.
In your report this is slurred over and it is not clear what now remains controversial.
Apparently, it is that: 1) whether or not there is need right away for repairs on a number (such-and-such= names) of big pits, and their stoppage for repairs with transfer of their targets to the small pits? 2) The leasing of medium pits as well? 3) —— precisely through the Donets Economic Confer-ence? There is no clear statement about this.
I or any other person reading the report has to complete it in your stead.
That is the way to ruin even a good case! To clear things up we would need your plan: close down for repairs so and so.
Within two years (or how many?) to have small pits yield 900 million, etc.

I personally made a call yesterday about it to Ramzin (a first-class, and most honest scientist) and Smilga.
Smilga promised me to call a commission: Bazhanov & Ramzin & yourself.
You must know how to fight instead of taking too modest an attitude as you are doing.
I have not shown anyone my letter to you.
Make the best preparation you can for the commission; and if you are voted down, let me have your “minority opinion ” precisely and clearly stated.

But §4 a) says: * See previous document.
—Ed.
“The Soviet Government shall allocate 100 dollars for each worker coming to settle”, while §5 a) and b) say that 2,800 & 3,000= 5,800 are due to settle.
Doesn’t that make our expenditure 600,000 dollars? Or should we add clearly: 100 dollars each for 3,000 men for the Nadezhdinsk Works and nothing more? 2) Why is there no written statement from all three, Rutgers, Heywood and Calvert, that they are willing to sign the enclosed “undertaking”? Please order this today and be sure to have it done in English.
3) End of § 8 (our pledge to repay expenses) should be set out more precisely in a special §: “The Soviet Govern-ment undertakes to reimburse expenses only on the follow-ing principles and in the following cases.
” 4) Is there any sign of an ultimatum in the amendments made by Rutgers and the others to the text adopted by the Supreme Economic Council Presidium? Please send me your reply (& the English pledge) and return this letter to Molotov, C.

It is high time that everyone should understand that the absence of precise information on the replenishment of the firewood and material stock greatly hampers the centre’s planning and distribution work, and has a grave effect on every branch of the national economy, because wood fuel is the basis for the operation of all state industry and the rail-ways, while timber, apart from meeting the country’s acute domestic needs, serves as a real basis for our foreign trade, without which the economic revival of the Repub-lic is impossible.
This is a categorical order to all timber committees at once to regulate their reports on the stock-ing, carting out and delivery of firewood, charcoal and timber; all gubernia Cheka must see to the precise obser-vance of the deadlines and forms laid down by the C.

This Hammer’s son (and partner), a doctor, is in Russia, and has brought Semashko $60,000 worth of surgical in-struments as a gift.
The son has visited the Urals with Martens and has decided to help rehabilitate the Urals in-dustry.
An official report will soon be made by Martens.

3 7 1 There can be no question at all of Trotsky and myself withdrawing from the Executive Committee of the Communist International.
It is quite enough for Krasin to make a statement on the debts.
Urquhart has so far disagreed with the percentage level:he offered 5 per cent of gross output, our commission de-manded 10 per cent.
The British and the French want to plunder us.
That we shall not allow.
We shall pay no attention to their “dis-satisfaction” over this.
There is one concession: timber in the Caucasus.
Trade arrangements with the Germans are under way.
They are starting with Italy: she has offered a loan.
This matter should be speeded up and pushed forward by every means.
There is a contract with Armstrong on the boilers.
There is a contract with Norway.
The only “sharp turn” is with Britain and France, and I do not see that we should make any concessions or steps.
Hoover is a real asset.

1921 Comrade Krzhizhanovsky: I draw your attention to Comrade Rakovsky’s article, “The Famine and Maize”, in Pravda No.
231 (14.
X.
1921).
In the light of this article, I feel sure that the conclusion of the State Planning Commission’s agricultural section on maize (of 13.
IX.
1921, signed by Comrade Sereda) is inadequate.
The advantages of maize (and beans) appear to be proven in several respects.
Since this is so, faster and more vigor-ous measures should be taken.
Of especial importance isthe fact that the seed requirement is between one-tenth and one-fifteenth of the normal quantity.
This appears to be the crucial consideration.
It should be decided right away that the total quantity of maize required for the full sowing of all the spring area throughout the Volga region should be purchased in good time for the sowing in the spring of 1922.
To attain this aim, this should be paralleled by: 1) elaboration of very precise and very circumstantially considered measures for the propaganda of maize and the teaching of peasants to grow maize with the meagre re-sources now available; 2) urgent discussion of whether practical ways and means can be found to make maize a part of the people’s diet, under the existing conditions in peasant farming, their habits and way of life (cf.
page 35, the State Planning Com-mission’s memo).
I request an immediate discussion of these questions in the agricultural section and the presidium, making sure to collect every shade of opinion on maize.

1921 Comrade Krestinsky: I should like to know your opinion about whether or not it is time to make these two kinds of calculations: first, a plan (a quite rough and general plan, by way of the first approximation) for restoring our currency.
Say: under such-and-such conditions, over a period of so many years, it would be possible by consistently applying such-and-such measures to achieve so-and-so.
Do you (and the finance commission) believe that such a calculation is possible or that even an approximate cal-culation of this kind is premature and impossible for the time being? Second, is it possible to convert our expenditure budget into gold and compare it (on the main heads—and perhaps by departments and regions, gubernias, capitals, etc.
, as far as possible) with pre-war figures? We should make a start, and as soon as possible, on a reform, through such or similar calculation, of our quite neglected and irrelevantly, spontaneously, and irregularly inflated budget.
I request you to let me have your opinion on this matter and—if you have no special objections—to raise it in the finance commission.

Comrade Sosnovsky: I have received your letter concerning Yezhov.
I very much doubt that we could afford to let 1,000-1,500 warehouse and office workers get 1,250,000-1,500,000 (Soviet) rubles a month.
Hardly.
I think: work out bonuses for rapid clearing of warehouse in economic enterprise (state plant, factory, state farm, etc.
).
It is up to Yezhov to put through your other proposals (and a copy for me).
Let us have a precise and short draft.

CHICHERIN Comrade Chicherin: See letter, p.
4 and over.
Lenin October 22, 1921 Dear Vladimir Ilyich: Today’s coded message from Comrade Krasin, a part of which has reached us, on Urquhart’s statements and campaign shows that the matter is much more serious, and cannot be explained solely by bluff designed to secure 5 per cent royalties on the concessions.
There has apparently been some disappoint-ment over our new line.
Naturally, in the establishment of such a complex historic combination, as concessions to West European capitalists under a Bolshevik government, the ar-ranging of these combinations does not proceed smoothly or at once.
The more reason, therefore, for us to see to it that these ? frictions are overcome.
I personally am quite unaware of the ? springs of our policy which caused a certain turn in our line ? at the end of August, so that I am altogether not competent to say whether such a turn had been necessary.
.
.
.
Comrade Chicherin: There was not the slightest shadow of a “turn in our line” in August (see page 1).
We have never taken a pledge and will never take a pledge not to arrest swindlers, not to shoot plotters, not to reject excessively greedy propos-als by concessionaires.
* See Document 471 of this volume.

On the debt question, I advise you to put through the Politbureau the appointment of a commission (your can-didates?) to check up on the state of work of the Groman and Goikhbarg commissions.
I personally see nothing in “Krasin’s facts”, etc.
, except Urquhart’s blackmail.
They will hazard an intervention in spring, if they can force Poland: nothing can be done to prevent this except strengthening our defence capacity.
Mikhalsky writes about new turns by Britain.
What is the point there? What do you think? Is it that they are afraid of Washington, and want to “placate” France and intimidate Russia? Agreements and concessions with the Americans are of exceptional importance to us: we have something (not a little) with Hoover.
We almost have something with Ham-mer.
Amruss is on the way.
385 Everything should be done (by you especially) to elim-inate all friction (regrettable and harmful) between Lit-vinov and Martens.

CHICHERIN AND REMARKS ON A DRAFT SOVIET GOVERNMENT DECLARATION ON DEBT RECOGNITION 387 October 24 Comrade Chicherin: I am sending you my amendments and request you to return them with your comment.
No.
1) We do not have 150 but 1 3 0 million including the Far-Eastern Republic.
No.
2) Not to “yield”, but to make a number of conces-sions.
No.
3) The main thing: our claims to them should be stated subtly and precisely.
With communist greetings, Lenin Draft Declaration The Brussels Conference of representatives of the Powers, accord-ing to the West European press, has set as a condition for granting credits to the Government of Russia in aid of the starving its recogni-tion of the debts of the former Russian governments.
Nothing has yet been communicated to the Government of Russia about the decisions of this conference.
However, the Government of Russia, in face of the starving masses, refuses to abide by the subtleties of diplomatic etiquette and feels it to be its bounden duty to declare here and now its attitude to the Brussels decisions.
The British Prime Minister, Mr.
Lloyd George, in his speech in the British Parliament on August 16, said that the proposal to use the famine in Russia to force her to recognise the tsarist government’s debts was a devilish scheme.
Nevertheless, the Brussels Conference, being quite aware that, in view of the scale of the famine disaster in Russia, the Soviet Govern-ment is incapable, with its own resources, to save the famine-stricken population, has made the granting of credits to Russia, without which serious aid to the starving is impossible, contingent on the Soviet Government’s recognition of the old debts.
Drawing the attention of the toiling masses in all countries and of all citizens who cherish humanitarian considerations, to these acts of the Brussels Conference, the Government of Russia hereby declares that the proposal to have the old debts recognised on certain terms now meets its own intentions.
Since its inception, the Soviet Govern-ment has set itself economic co-operation with other Powers as one of the main aims of its policy.
It has always declared its readiness to make available sufficient profit to foreign capitalists who wouldhelp it to work Russia’s natural resources and rehabilitate her eco-nomic apparatus.
At present, it says that the official statements of the President of the United States of America and of the Ministers of Great Britain have repeatedly expressed the idea that three years after the end of the world war there is still no real peace, the plight of the masses is becoming ever more acute, state debts are increasing and there is growing economic dislocation.
It is quite obvious that it is inconceivable to establish full peace without Russia, with her 150 million population, that the economic dislocation cannot be overcome, so long as Russia is left in ruins, and that the question of relations between Russia and the rest of the world, which is a paramount world question, cannot be solved without an agreement with the Soviet Government.
From the standpoint of the long-term interests and constant requirements of all states and all peoples, the economic rehabilitation of Russia is a prime necessi-ty not only for her but for them as well.
Without economic co-opera-tion with other countries, the task of Russia’s economic revival proves to be exceptionally difficult, and its fulfilment is sure to be dragged out over a much longer period.
This task can be best carried out by a workers’ and peasants’ government.
It is not hampered in its work of rehabilitating the national economy by the private self-seeking interests of separate groups of capitalists.
A workers’ and peasants’ power is guided immediately by the interests of the broadest masses of people which, in essence, amount to the interests of society as a whole.
With its purpose of satisfying the interests of all the toiling people of Russia, the workers’ and peasants’ power, which has emerged victorious from the incredi-ble ordeals of the Civil War, holds out to private initiative and capital the opportunity of co-operating with the workers’ and peasants’ pow-er in developing Russia’s natural resources.
The Soviet Govern-ment has restored private trade, private property in small enter-prises, and the right of concession and lease of large enterprises.
The Soviet power holds out to foreign capital a sufficient part of the profit to satisfy its interests, so as to attract it to participation in economic work in Russia.
Following this path, the Soviet Govern-ment strives to have economic agreements with all the Powers, for which purpose there is ultimately a need to conclude a final peace settlement between Russia and other states.
With this task before it, the Soviet power has met with the demand on the part of the other Powers for recognition of the tsarist government’s old debts.
The Soviet Government declares that it is firmly convinced that no people is obliged to pay the cost of the chains it has worn for centuries.
But in its firm resolve to reach full agreement with the other No.
2 Powers, the Government of Russia is prepared to make a yield on this cardinal question.
In this way it also number of meets the desires of many small holders of Russian substantial state loans, especially in France, for whom its rec-concessions ognition of tsarist debts is of substantial interest.
On the strength of these considerations, the Govern-ment of Russia declares that it is prepared to recog-No.
1 130nise its obligations to other states and their citizens on state loans contracted by the tsarist government before 1914, provided it is granted easy terms, giving it a practical possibility of meeting these obligations.
It goes without saying that an indispensable pre-requisite of such recognition shall be the simulta-neous obligation on the part of the Great Powers unconditionally to end all acts threatening the security of the Soviet Republics and the immunity of their boundaries.
In other words, the Soviet Repub-lic will undertake these obligations only in the event the Great Powers conclude with it a final general peace, and if its government is recognised by the other Powers.
With that end in view, the Government of Russia proposes the early convocation of an international conference to deal with the tasks indicated above, to No.
3 examine the reciprocal demands of the other Pow-reciprocal ||||| ers [ and the Government of Russia \ and work out claims final peace treaty between them.
Only after the [ on each other ||||| aconvocation of this conference will it be possible to \ on each other ||||| reach a general peace settlement.
This will in no sense ||||| be achieved by the Washington Conference, whose deci-Powers sions will not be recognised by the Republic of Russia, which has not been invited to attend the conference.
On the fourth anniversary of the Soviet Government, to be marked in a few days, everyone will have to recognise that the efforts of its numerous external and internal enemies have merely served to con-solidate the workers’ and peasants’ power in Russia, as the true defender and representative of the interests of the toiling masses of Russia, and of her independence.
The fresh interventionist designs against Soviet Russia, whose existence is evident from the numerous statements by the leading organs of the press in the Entente countries, will merely help to strengthen the indissoluble bonds between the toiling masses of Russia and the workers’ and peasants’ power, which represents their will, but any attempt to implement these schemes can merely increase the suffering of the toiling masses, and delay the moment of Russia’s eventual economic rehabilitation, thereby also delivering a blow at the economic interests of all other peoples.
The proposal being put forward by the Government of Russia is the best evidence of its urge for peace with all states, and the estab-lishing with them of undisturbed economic relations.
It is in the in-terests of all states and peoples that this proposal should be realised.
The Government of Russia expresses the firm hope that its propos-al will shortly result in the achievement of a final settlement of eco-nomic and political relations between Russia and the other states.

CHICHERIN 388 Comrade Chicherin: I think that the Government should not, must not deny such silly rumours.
The thing to do is to give them to the press and to ridicule, make a laughing-stock of those who believe these rumours and circulate them.
This is black-mail on the part of the Urquharts and the Curzons: such rumours are designed to hamper agreement at present.
This is patent blackmail.

I very strongly recommend the bearer of this, Comrade Nikolai Alexandrovich Alexeyev.
I have known him since 1902, when we worked together on Iskra in London.
He is a very well-educated Marxist, a Bolshevik and a comrade who is remarkably honest in doing his duty.
He has been tossed out into Siberia for about 10 years, and would now like to make his way back to the centre.
He should be helped to move to the centre, because a ten-year stay in Siberia is too much; worse than too much.
He should be replaced in Siberia by someone of the absolutely reliable, honest old Party men: the “Communists” in Siberia have been committing a host of shocking things and stupidities.

Chebotaryov is undoubtedly an honest man.

I believe that his honesty can and must be relied upon.
He now seems to be politi-cally close to Smena Vekh.

To the conflicts and disagreements between Pyatakov and Rukhimovich are added the disagreements between Remeiko (and the comrades he names on p.

These discords and dissensions in Donbas, which is our fortress, are highly dangerous.
Please, have a look through the pamphlet (or the two pages, 13 and 14, which is quite enough) and write me at least a couple of words on the measures which could (and should) be taken to eliminate discords and frictions in Donbas.

referred to your commission the question of an agreement with Steinberg.

e.
, all the 100,000 kilograms will cost him 60,000 million= 60 milliard; this means the percentage of profit 194 : 60= 323 per cent).

I think the R.

has a share of super-profits, reckoning super-profits as over and above 250 per cent? Perhaps we could (1) drive a bargain so as to have a special share of the super-profits, reckoning super-profits at 100 or 200 per cent? (2) secure by special arrangement the possibility to train our own men (especially in Centrosoyuz) in the methods and organisation of trade? (3) specifically assure ourselves of the possibility of cancelling the agreement earlier, as soon as we fools have learned enough from the clever people.
I think that after driving a hard bargain and checking everything over and over again, we should conclude the agreement, because fools must pay a high price for being taught.

inclusion in the Central Peat Administration programme for 1922 of the working of the Rubskoye peat bogs or transfer of their working to the power-station project.
On the strength of the available material resources, it is necessary right away to establish and approve a programmefor construction and peat bog working for the Ivanovo-Voznesensk station, and their priority, for 1922.
I think it is desirable to secure participation in the dis-cussion of this matter, apart from the central departments concerned (Commission for Utilisation, Public Works Com-mittee, and Central Peat Administration), a representative of the Ivanovo-Voznesensk gubernia economic conference and the chief engineer of the construction project.

We should face Hartwig (and the other Ger---mans) with this flat and precise question: what is it you want of us? a treaty without Britain? Very well, then! Let’s have a draft as soon as possible and we shall sign it.
Until now, the Germans have come forward with nothing but words.
For the sake of diplomacy, Krasin had to avoid showing his cards to Stinnes, and even had to be amiable with him.

I propose that a number of authors should be asked to write a pamphlet under the editorship of Bukharin, who should be authorised to share it out between the authors, obtain their manuscripts within two weeks and show the Politbureau in proof.

P.
C.
office practice in dealing with complaints and applications that in specially serious and urgent cases it helps to use “per-sonal contacts”, i.
e.
, personal communication with various Party comrades holding sufficiently influential positions in the localities.
This serves to reduce the delays which are inevitable in the usual departmental routing of busi-ness, and generally enhances the required effect.
An example is provided by the case of terrorism by the kulak “lair” in the (new) Yelan Uyezd of Saratov Guber-nia, which had made up to the Soviet power and the Party.
Within 10 days we obtained a reply telegram from the pleni-potentiary All-Russia Cheka representative in the Volga area saying that “all measures to detect the guilty havebeen taken”, when the inquiry was sent in this “comradely” manner.
There are similar results in other cases.
But this method can be applied more extensively only where there is sufficient knowledge of the responsible func-tionaries actually on the spot.
Our request is, therefore, urgently to draw up and send to the C.
P.

4 5 7 The first and second deputies, as you will see from the plan, will have to break new ground.
We have decided,for the time being, until your return and the experiment with Tsyurupa, that this plan is not to be turned into a decision.
We shall first try it out and check it in practice.
Let me know what you think.
Good-bye for the time being, and take your treatment seriously.
Yours, Lenin Written on December 3 , 1 9 2 1 First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXIII Printed from the original 534 * TO THE MOSCOW GUBERNIA COMMISSION FOR CHECKING AND PURGING THE PARTY I am very sorry that my request to inform me about the case of Comrade Shapiro’s expulsion from the Party has caused the cancellation of the examination of his case by the Moscow Gubernia Commission scheduled for 18.
00 hours today, December 3.
This is a result of a misunderstand-ing and mistake, because the most important thing, of course, is the speedy examination of the case.
On the substance of the case, I apply to the Moscow Gubernia Commission for Checking and Purging the Party to take into account the following of my considerations.
1) Over a period of several years I have repeatedly heard from N.
K.
Krupskaya that Shapiro was an exceptionally honest worker, but was not liked for his stringent demands.
That is why when the purging began I warned N.
K.
Krup-skaya that attention should be paid to a possible and prob-able intrigue connected with this.
2) My article in the press that the Mensheviks and the Bundists who joined the R.
C.
P.
were unreliable was fre-quently taken to mean that they should all be expelled.
* I feel it to be my duty, therefore, to state that I have always considered that each case must be dealt with indi-vidually, and in confirmation refer, for instance, to the * A reference to the article “Purging the Party” (present edition, Vol.
33, pp.
39-41).
—Ed.
former Menshevik Chirkin, who joined the R.
C.
P.
much later than Shapiro, and about whose wavering we had precise facts, and not just rumour or hearsay.
Still, after an all-round examination of Chirkin’s case, I agreed with the Ukrainian comrades who were defending him, that Chirkin should be left in the Party.
3) Shapiro’s application has Comrade A.
Yenukidze’s inscription of 3.
IX.
1921, saying: “I fully certify everything set out here by Comrade Shapiro for the 1917 period.
” And what Comrade Shapiro has stated about this period is of exceptional importance, because the meaning of it is that the Menshevik Shapiro had started to oppose the Mensheviks even before the October Revolution.
In reply to my special inquiry about Shapiro addressed to Comrade Yenukidze the latter told me today that he had worked with him on the front-line commission of the old, Menshevik All-Russia C.
E.
C.
, from April to August 1917.
Having been in close contact with Comrade Shapiro in that period, Comrade Yenukidze told me that he had absolutely no doubt about Comrade Shapiro’s sincerity, and that he, Yenukidze, would certainly be in favour of leaving Comrade Shapiro in the Party.
Comrade Yenukidze gave me this additional charac-teristic fact: after the July 1917 days, when the Bolshe-viks were being fiercely harassed, Shapiro put up such a defence of the Bolsheviks at the meeting, that Vainstein, a member of the Menshevik C.
C.
, all but used his fists against Shapiro.
Let me add that Comrade Yenukidze, a Party member since 1898, is one of the old Party guard, who in fact should check and purge our Party.
I believe that any evi-dence coming from the ranks of this old guard deserves triple attention.
I feel therefore that it is quite wrong for the district commission to expel Comrade Shapiro without summoning Comrade Yenukidze.
It is my request to the Moscow Gubernia Commission to summon Comrade Yenu-kidze, Secretary of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
, in Shapiro’s case.
4) Comrade Shapiro’s application says that he is the author of a pamphlet on the agrarian question issued in 1907, under the pseudonym of M.
Shanin.
As Comrade Shapiro has said, I analysed this pamphlet in my book, The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution 1905-1907 (2nd ed.
, Petrograd, 1919, p.
84 et seq.
).
* While criticising Shanin for a number of Menshevik errors, I noted even at the time, over 10 years ago, that he differed from the Mensheviks.
For instance, on p.
85 of the said book, I noted that Shanin “prompted, of course, by the very best motives, defends confiscation against redemption payments”.
** This is a very essential fact, indicating that more than ten years ago, Comrade Shapiro had had a tendency to move away from the Mensheviks to the revolutionary side.
5) My fears that the purging of the Party could provide some people with a pretext for an intrigue against Comrade Shapiro—fears about which I told N.
K.
Krupskaya long before the start of the purging in the city of Moscow—have been borne out by the following circumstance.
The District Commission has expelled Shapiro without summoning Ye-nukidze, without naming anyone who knows Shapiro well at his work, and who could cite facts about his unreliabil-ity.
The commission has called Shapiro “unstable and wavering”, without offering the least proof, without the slightest concrete indication.
One cannot help thinking that someone’s far from impartial reference (from among his fellow workers, for instance) to the effect, let us say, that he is “not one of us”, that he is “alien” to us, could very well have played a part.
Let us recall, however, that the Party cell at the Chief Committee for Political Education unanimously came out in favour of Shapiro (as I learned from Comrade Anna Ivanovna Meshcheryakova, an old Party member, whom I have known since the émigré period, and a member of the cell who attended the meeting).
Shapiro was in charge of one of the six departments of the Chief Committee for Political Education.
Consequently, the persons subordinate to him were in a small minority at the Party cell meeting.
No one could have had a closer view of Comrade Shapiro’s day-to-day work than the cell of his establishment.
If that cell had unanimously come out for Shapiro, the weight * See present edition, Vol.
13, pp.
217-431.
—Ed.
** Ibid.
, p.
288.
—Ed.
of such a vote should, I think, be regarded as very great.
I believe it is highly probable that Shapiro has become a victim of an intrigue, rumour to the effect that he is “not one of us”, without there being a shred of evidence, without any direct statement by a single Party member, who has had an occasion to observe Comrade Shapiro’s work at close range.
On the strength of what I have stated, I request the Moscow Gubernia Commission for Checking and Purging the Party that it should summon Comrade Yenukidze, take what I have said into consideration, and check up on who precisely has spoken out against Shapiro, and wheth-er this is not an intrigue.
It is also my request to let me have a copy of the decision on this case by the Moscow Gubernia Commission.

The talks with Comrade Caroti could be based on the draft contract which he has and which leaves much room for any necessary changes.
According to a report from the representative of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade in Italy, the Cito-Cinema company is a solid Italian film-producing enter-prise which is financed by the Italian Bank of Discount and about which there must be a reference at the Financial and Accounting Department of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.
I consider this business extremely important and urgent.

OSINSKY 469 Comrade Osinsky: I have read and reread your letter with all possible attention.
I resolutely disagree, and cannot bring it up at the Politbureau.
It is, of course, your unquestionable right to bring it up at the plenum.
You have not a shred, literally not a shred, of business-like and organisational arguments.
You have made a mistake by insisting on Muralov’s removal, seeing an “intrigue” where there was not a bit of it.
But in order to direct such a People’s Commissariat, as the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture, and to do it in such dreadfully difficult conditions, one must not see “intrigues” or “counter-weights” in those who take a differ-ent view of matters or have a different approach, but must value independent-minded men.
You must try out the trio in practice: you & a peasant (we do not yet know who and what kind of man he will be) & Teodorovich.
There must be no haste to change it before it has come to life.
Your priority influence is assured by the law and by many other things.

No one can prevent him from attending (and voting) if neither you nor Teodorovich is there.

But there is no reason to change the Politbureau decision.
It must be tried out; it is organisationally correct.

STALIN Comrade Stalin: I draw your attention to this report from Krasin (en-closed) which I think is plausible and highly important.
4 7 6 As soon as Orjonikidze returns, there must be a conference with Chicherin on this question to work out a number of proposals for passage through the Politbureau.

Should anything be added to this? Is it all right to tell about the plan to invite Russia and Germany to the second conference in April 1922? 478 What source should I quote? How authentic or probable is this to be considered? 2.
To Comrade Chicherin (Litvinov) Is it all right to characterise our progress for 1921 by the increase in the number of trade treaties with European powers? If it is, list them (in 1920 only with Britain, and in 1921 with such-and-such countries).
If not, is it all right to characterise progress in this respect by means of data other than the volume of trade exchange (about which I shall inquire from the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade)? 3.
To Comrade Lezhava Is it possible to characterise our progress for 1921 in terms of developing trade with other countries by means of two or three figures, however general and approximate? For instance, purchases and orders in 1920—about so much; for so many months of 1921, to an approximate figure, giving a probable total of up to so much? Is it possible to bring out Germany in this respect? Is it possible to give two or three final figures on the volume of our exports in 1921 as compared with that in 1920? 4.
To Comrade Fomin Could you let me have the exact or rough figures about the number of new locomotives (and cars? and tank cars?) brought in from abroad in 1921? compared with 1920? and other products for transport? ditto: ordered in 1921 for the amount of?

To Comrade Osinsky Could you give me for my report at the Congress of Soviets 2-3 summary figures, first, on our fulfilment of the task of supplying peasants with seed for the autumn of 1921; second, on other tangible results or successes already in evidence in 1921 ? 8.
To Comrade Smilga (or Trifonov) Could you let me have, for insertion in my report at the Congress of Soviets, the most concise figures on fuel: I have Pyatakov’s report on Donbas.
Could I have the results for 1920 and 1921? ditto on oil? ditto on peat? ditto on firewood for 1920 and 1921? 9.

I have personally seenher work as a secretary of the C.

Managing Depart-ment, i.
e.
, at very close range.
However, I consider it necessary to point out that I have known the whole Alli-luyev family, i.
e.
, the father, the mother and the two daughters, since before the October Revolution.
In partic-ular, during the July days, when Zinoviev and I had to hide out and the danger was very great, it is this family that hid me, and the four of them, with the complete con-fidence of the Party Bolsheviks at the time, not only gave us both asylum, but also rendered a number of other secret services without which we would not have been able to escape Kerensky’s bloodhounds.
It could very well be that in view of Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva’s youth, this circum-stance has not been made known to the commission.
Nor am I aware whether the commission was able, in examining the case of Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva, to make a comparison of the facts about her father, who had worked in various capacities in assisting the Party long before the revolution, and had, I have heard, rendered important services to the illegal Bolsheviks under tsarism.
I consider it my duty to inform the Central Commission for Purging the Party of these circumstances.

SOLTS Comrade Zalutsky and Comrade Solts I have had a letter from Comrade Kasparova-Popova (address: 3 House of Soviets, Flat 63, telephone 58-97).
She writes that she is absolutely desperate about her ex-pulsion from the Party, and asks me to intercede with the Central Commission for Purging the Party and request them to make a thorough verification of her case, referring to her brother Slava Kasparov and her husband Popov, who had been sent to the Far East by Comrade Sverdlovand was killed there.
She writes that, together with her brother, she began to take an interest in the Party at the age of 14, was a member of school study circles, and joined the Party at the age of 17, doing purely technical work.
I do not know this Kasparova personally, or have for-gotten her, but I knew her brother very well abroad, where he was an émigré after the first revolution of 1905, was a member of the Bolshevik organisation, and enjoyed the well-deserved respect of all Bolsheviks with whom I had occasion to meet and who had seen Kasparov work.
This Kasparov died in Switzerland before the 1917 revolution (his health being overtaxed by the difficult conditions of émigré life).
I shall try to collect information about anyone who may have known Kasparov’s sister better.
For my part, I request the Central Commission for Purging the Party to verify the case of Comrade Kasparova’s expulsion from the Party.

If the deadline is on the 26th, it is perhaps still possible to have this checked and clarified, but still we should not in any case let such an opportunity go by.

a) of the quantity of commodities held by the state (exchange fund) b) quantity of bank-notes 2) by way of experiment in one or two uyezds issue (through co-operative establishments?) exchange bonds, fully secured by the commodity fund? Inventorying the commodity fund is not the business of the People’s Commissariat for Finance.
This calls for some additional structuring or restructuring to take account of all the material budget.
Still, we have authorised Syromolotov to do this.
The bonds could be issued when the commodities are available, and, I think, they will be all right, but in the initial period there will be little benefit for our own pocket.
is not “benefit for the pocket”, ! My purpose ∃ but experiment, experience.

I believe the task is above all to “catch out” the scientists who have missed the foreign experience, as being idle and pedantic.

Unless your conference reaches an absolutely negative conclusion, then we should think about who should be assigned the immediate practical performance.
Please phone me about this.

My suggestion is that you pull yourself together at once.
The machinery of Soviet administration must work accurately, smoothly and swiftly.
Any slackness in it does damage not only to the interests of individuals but to the whole business of administration, which becomes illusory and imaginary.
Assuming the real measure of labour productivity in each given establishment to be above all the extent to which all business passing through it is actually executed without delay, I demand that henceforth you submit the quickest and most exhaustive replies to all the cases and inquiries directed to you.
To confine yourself to formal replies and dispatch to other establishments also means breeding red tape and wasting paper.

It is my earnest request that you make arrangements: 1) for the funeral to be held properly (I wonder if it is convenient to do this through the Moscow Soviet or the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs); 2) then we should look after his wife, who is probably absolutely without any money and who, I happen to know, is absolutely helpless and unadapted to the present Rus-sian life; 3) we should also have the press carry an obituary.
He was obviously sent to his grave by his life as an émigré and by our Russian negligence.
We have been losing valuable workers in an absolutely unpardonable manner.

To Comrade Molotov for members of the Politbureau Comrade Preobrazhensky told me by phone that he would resign if Krasnoshchekov is appointed second deputy, and that is also the opinion of the whole Collegium with the exception, it seems, of Sokolnikov.
Stalin believes that the decision should be confirmed but its execution held up until Sokolnikov’s return, otherwise Krasnoshchekov may be badly badgered.
I think that this danger will remain, unless the Politbureau comes out at once with full force against the Collegium, and unless it backs up and supports Krasnoshchekov to the hilt.
I consider this ques-tion extremely important because a crying mistake is being made not only by the whole collegium, but also by Preobrazhensky, who are unable to see the need for making all-round use of a man who, with solid experience of work in America and in the Far-Eastern Republic, takes a practical approach to financial matters.
That is the most important thing.
That is precisely what Preobrazhensky and the other members of the collegium lack.
Their whole opposition to Krasnoshchekov is a tissue of harmful prejudices.
That is why I should favour immediate passage of the decision on Krasnoshchekov through Soviet chan-nels.

KRASIN Krasin Soviet Government Delegation London The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade announced in December that 8 million poods of grain had been pur-chased but not shipped.
Having received new credits, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade has undertaken the obligation to deliver 15 million poods of food grain by April 1, at five million a month.
In January so far, not a single pood has been received, and there is no news of any ships sailing or of proposed shipments.
In view of the extremely grave food situation, I propose that you inform us within two days: first, how much grain has been pur-chased; second, how much has been shipped, on which ships and to which ports; third, how much and when is to be shipped shortly; fourth, plan for meeting obligation to purchase 15 million poods.

1922 Personal Secret Comrade Unschlicht, All-Russia Cheka and Comrade Fomin, People’s Commissariat for Railways Copy to N.
P.
Gorbunov A few days ago, I had occasion to see for myself the state of the All-Russia Cheka railway trolleys, which are apparently in the joint charge of the All-Russia Cheka and the P.
C.
R.
I think that railway trolleys are absolutely indispensable for the All-Russia Cheka, and the People’s Commissariat for Defence (I have heard that the All-Russia Cheka has two) at the Moscow Junction for very fast assignments, for highly urgent and highly secret dis-patch of small (5-10 men) detachments, etc.
I found the railway trolleys in the worst state possible.
I saw utter neglect, semi-ruin (very many things have been stolen!), total disorder, the fuel appears to have been stolen, there is water in the kerosene, the engine running excruciatingly, stoppages on the way every minute, the traffic wretched, delays at the stations, station-masters completely uninformed (apparently without any idea at all that the All-Russia Cheka trolleys should have special travelling warrants, and that they should go through with maximum speed not in the sense of running speed—these machines are apparently “Soviet”, i.
e.
, are very bad ones— but in the sense of the shortest possible delays and waste of time, with military precision), there is chaos, slovenli-ness and absolute disgrace.
Fortunately, being incognito on the trolley, I was able to hear and did hear, frank and truthful (and not the officially honeyed and lying) talk of the officials, and I understood from their talk that this was no exception, but that the whole organisation was incredibly disgraceful, with complete dislocation and clumsiness.
This was the first time I travelled along the railway lines not as a “dignitary”, getting all and sundry to hustle with dozens of special telegrams, but as an unknown per-son travelling with All-Russia Cheka men, and the impres-sion I got was one of depressing hopelessness.
If such is the state of a special small gear in the mechanism under the special supervision of the All-Russia Cheka itself, I can well imagine the state of things in the P.
C.
R.
in general! The disorder there must be incredible.
I propose: to appoint at once, by agreement between the All-Russia Cheka and the P.
C.
R.
(perhaps also getting the People’s Commissariat for Defence to join, if it has any trolleys?), a responsible person who would be close to the actual thing, and not a high-ranking official.
This person to be strictly responsible for any negligence.
Issue a short military-worded instruction about the All-Russia Cheka trolleys, about their secret and rapid move-ments, maintenance in good repair, storage of fuel, traffic without delays along the Circular Road, the junction and everywhere, etc.
, etc.
Add to the instruction, by the way, that at the request of N.
P.
Gorbunov (who will be doing this only with my consent) a railway trolley is to be made available promptly and run to the place he designates.
Send detailed report on execution to N.
P.
Gorbunov, C.
P.
C.
business manager.
I also authorise Gorbunov to verify execution from time to time, i.
e.
, make unannounced trips on railway trolleys, noting down the minutes required for each operation (summons, running time, stops, etc.
) and inspection.

ON THE STEINBERG CONCESSION 1 17.
I.
1922 To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau I enclose Lezhava’s report on the Steinberg concession.
Please have this matter raised in the Politbureau on * See Document 595 of this volume and Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
54, Document 218.
—Ed.
Thursday, so as to allow the C.
P.
C.
to pass the C.
C.
decision through Soviet government channels on Friday.
518 Appoint two rapporteurs on this question for the Polit-bureau: A.
D.
Tsyurupa and a representative of the C.
P.
C.
majority.
This is an important business, and I very much fear that the C.
P.
C.
majority (opposing Tsyurupa) is about to make another mistake in the spirit of “communist conceit”: they are afraid to allow a merchant who knows how to trade to make money, and their overriding concern is only to secure a majority for the Communists, most of whom may bawl a bit, but then they never touch the stuff.
519 I draw your attention to §5: three Communists (ignorant of trade? I know of only two Communists who have shown an ability to trade: Belov (GUM) and Serg.
Malyshev) are about to teach two merchants how to trade.
I am afraid that this “majority” will look very much like Shchedrin’s accoucheurs.
520 Perhaps § 5 should be amended as follows: Steinberg, as representative, be empowered to decide everything alone, while the majority of the board should have the right to know everything and to complain to us about Steinberg’s acts, without suspending them (i.
e.
, the majority of three against two will nominally retain the right to reverse Stein-berg’s decisions, but we shall tell him that we shall not reverse anything without a special C.
L.
D.
decision).
Meanwhile, the three Communists will be given the duty, by a special C.
C.
decision, to study and to learn the busi-ness in three years or so, otherwise they will be expelled with ignominy.

is meeting in plenary session today.
Per-haps, it could be possible, so as not to put off the matter,to adopt by phone the following proposal concerning the Steinberg concession (Politbureau decision mandatory upon the C.
L.
D.
): “To accept the Lezhava commission’s pro-posal with an addendum of this kind: Steinberg, as repre-sentative of the board, shall act on his own, with decisions by the board majority (3 representatives of the board, 1—Steinberg, 1—capitalist), without suspending Stein-berg’s order, only referable to the C.
L.
D.
” 521 This addendum should be adopted by the C.
L.
D.
, but not written into the board’s charter.
Then, by informing Stein-berg of this decision, we shall, on the one hand, provide the possibility of really doing business commercially to a man who knows commerce otherwise than from reading communist booklets and, on the other, in the event of Steinberg committing any crime, we shall assure ourselves of the possibility of revoking our decision through the C.
L.
D.
, without altering the Society’s charter in any way.
I think that such a guarantee is quite sufficient.

SMOLYANINOV 522 Comrade Smolyaninov Having looked over some of the tables, I propose that 1) clear additions in ink, in a fine hand, should always be made of absolute monthly figures (thousands or millions) (as in Table V, 4).
2) The same always in the margins of the table pre-war figure (1913 or 1916, etc.
) such-and-such (absolute figure).
3) The whole importance of these tables lies in their being visual and comparable.
That is why tables for 3 6 months: 1920-1921-1922, should be made to fit in the same form (have all the 3 6 months 1920-1922 in one table).

I think that in view of the terrible disorder at the Commissariat for Food in the Ukraine, Frumkin is needed there.
It is my firm conviction that the Commissariat for Food in general has to pull itself together most decidedly.
Perhaps, Klyshko or someone else will do for the purchases abroad.

work.
The doctor gave you per-mission to work for 8 hours.
I absolutely insist that overthe next four weeks you confine yourself to 4 hours of work a day, and besides take a complete rest on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays.
The rest of the time should be spent on a sanatorium regimen, for which pur-pose I expect to find a room in Sokolniki for you and your wife, so that you may have your usual sick-nurse, good food, etc.
I am quite sure that otherwise you will not be able to stand the four weeks of work, and that is something we need very badly because of the political situation.
Of these four hours, you must spend 2 hours a day in attend-ing the C.

meetings, which we shall hold twice a week, the other two hours being devoted exclusively to the signing of minutes and the necessary minimum of conversation in person and by phone.

You will be getting intensive help on the technical side from Gorbunov and Smolyaninov, and on the political side, from Kamenev and Stalin, and I have already made arrangements with all of them.
Once again I ask you to accept this plan and to carry it out punctiliously, because it is absolutely utopian to hope to protect your flat against an influx of friends from the Commissariat for Food, etc.
Please send your reply through Fotieva as soon as pos-sible.

TROTSKY 531 Comrade Trotsky: I have no doubt that the Mensheviks have now intensi-fied and will go on intensifying their most malicious agita-tion.
I think, therefore, that there is need to intensify sur-veillance over and reprisals against them.
I have already spoken about this with Unschlicht, and request you to find ten minutes or so for a conversation with him not by telephone.
As for the substance of the matter—I think Iagree with you.
I now seem to be developing an urge to write an article on topics close to those you have referred to, but I shall nevertheless be hardly able to do this before a fortnight is out.
Therefore, it would be perhaps extreme-ly useful if you were to join open battle in the press right away, naming this Menshevik, explaining the malicious whiteguard character of his speech, and issuing an impres-sive call to the Party to pull itself together.
The term “state capitalism” is, in my opinion (and I have repeatedly argued with Bukharin about it), the only theoretically cor-rect and necessary one to make inert Communists realise that the new policy is going forward in earnest.
But, of course, such malicious helpmates of the whiteguards, as all Mensheviks are, can pretend that they do not understand that state capitalism in a state with proletarian power can exist only as limited in time and sphere of extension, and conditions of its application, mode of supervision over it, etc.

SOKOLNIKOV Sunday, 22/I.
Comrade Sokolnikov: Concerning your letter of 18/I.
533 About Basha and the State Depository of Valuables.
I very much fear that you have been carried away here by the apparent “harmony” of the reorganisation plans.
Basha, who had been recommended to me by reliable men, and who has proved his ability to safekeep, can (I felt) only safekeep, safeguard and no more.
That is enough.
That is a great deal.
Under Trotsky’s general supervision and pressure, let them safekeep, safeguard, fight stealing and realise.
That is enough.
That is very much.
Why then “reorganise Gokhran”? Why reorganise it into a “gold—currency—administration”?I very much fear that reorganisation will be the death of us, without bringing any of the practical jobs to com-pletion.
Let Trotsky and Basha carry out the State Depository of Valuables job to the end: which is to collect, to safeguard and to realise.
The currency administration must be separate.
It was in Litvinov’s charge.
There is some mix-up between him and Krasin—the most painful question which caused a Politbureau decision a few days ago.
534 At all costs this mix-up should be eliminated and their (Litvinov’s and Krasin’s) work made concerted swiftly, immediately.
If Litvinov is unable to devote himself entirely to this (because of the diplomacy), and if (you) intend to have Krasnoshchekov head the currency administration, why not bring this up before the Politbureau: the State depository of Valuables—safekeeps, collects and assigns for realisa-tion; Krasnoshchekov—currency administration (instead of Litvinov or together with Litvinov?)? I am in mortal fear of reorganisations.
We are always reorganising things, instead of getting on with the prac-tical business.
You will do well to bear my words in mind: if the Commissariat for Finance does have a bitter enemy, it is the overdoing of reorganisation, and the underdoing of the practical business.
I cannot agree with you that the restructuring of our budget is at the centre of our work.
Trade and restoration of the ruble is at the centre.
It is true (as you write) that Larin is “undoubtedly” the “father” of the monstrous confusion of the budget.
It is also true that Preobrazhensky is the second guilty one.
And what about O.
Y.
Schmidt? He has not got Preobra-zhensky’s excuses! This O.
Y.
Schmidt should he removed.
He is a most harmful fumbler, and is the more dangerous because he fumbles with “pomposity” and is “superklug”*.
.
.
.
I think you should not engage in “restructuring” on the question of the budget: hand nine-tenths of it to the State Planning Commission and reduce all this to practical, * “too clever”.
—Ed.
prudent amendments.
Otherwise, the “restructuring” will run away with you, and in any case it is impossible just now, right away, to have a tolerable budget, and we shall perish because of the collapse of the monetary system, scattering our attention on tasks which are not feasible just now.
At the centre of everything just now is trade, first, domestic, and then, foreign trade; in connection with trade and on the basis of trade—a restoration of the ruble.
All attention should be concentrated on this.
The important, the most important, the basic task is to make a practical start on this.
Development of trade, organisation of the State Bank’s trade department, to have it moving the whole of trade, instead of sleeping—is the main thing.
What I mortally fear is that you, now actually in charge of the most important People’s Commissariat, will be car-ried away with restructuring, reorganisation, and the theo-retical line (you do have a weakness on this score)— instead of practice, practice and practice: raising trade, increasing and collecting taxes, restoring the ruble.
Really and truly I am in mortal fear of this; do not succumb to this weakness, otherwise we shall collapse.
Go on promot-ing Krasnoshchekov: he appears to be a practitioner.

To Comrade Molotov for circulating secretly (without making a copy) all members of the Politbureau together with Radek’s letter * I propose: 1) to adopt Radek’s proposal and to suggest right away to Krasin and Krestinsky to put out feelers, in a circular * Karl Radek’s letter has not been found.
—Ed.
dispatch, with several powers separately (I once made this proposal: I don’t understand why my written proposal has been lost.
It was sent to Molotov *).
2) To hasten Rakovsky’s arrival in Moscow and departure for Prague (having him return here a fortnight before Genoa).
3) To summon Krasin to Moscow by the same date.
4) To be highly careful and not to write abroad about our plans concerning Genoa, even in code, and to put off everything until the delegation conference in Moscow on 23.
II (a fortnight before Genoa).
This conference should also be attended by Chicherin, Krasin and Rakovsky (and Litvinov, and Vorovsky and Joffe, i.
e.
, the whole delegation).
5) To issue a preliminary directive from the Polit-bureau: (a) under no circumstances shall we recognise any debts, except those promised by Chicherin 535 ; (b) we shall recognise these debts only provided they are covered by our own counter-claims; (c) we give guarantees (if we are given a loan) only with timber in the north, and so forth; (d) we put the most extensive interpretation on § 1 of Bonomi’s terms 536 ; (e) we protect Germany and Turkey, etc.
; (f) we try to separate America, and in general to divide the powers.
537 6) We instruct each member of the delegation to work out on that basis a plan for negotiations in detail by 23.
II.
7) I propose that we reverse the decision permitting Chicherin to engage Sukhanov and Jordansky.
538 Radek is absolutely wrong.
The windbag Sukhanov will do nothing but harm.
Jordansky too.
It is extremely harmful.
8) Considering that we here in Moscow are surrounded by spies, Mensheviks and semi-Mensheviks, this (and similar) proposals should not be entered into the Politbureau minutes, but taken down separately, getting all the members of the delegation to sign on the same sheet and to return this sheet to Molotov, undertaking not to mention the * See Document 585 of this volume.

LEZHAVA 539 January 23, 1922 To Comrade Lezhava About the project for Harriman’s entry, let me tell you the following: unless I am mistaken, the main provision of the Derutra contract was that we and the Germans have an equal number of votes on the board.
If Harriman joined up with the Germans, i.
e.
, as part of the German half, that would, of course, be acceptable, but if the Germans plus Harriman have two-thirds of the votes, and we—one-third, that is, of course, unacceptable, In that case, a second society should be set up alongside Derutra, in which we and Harriman would have an equal number of votes.
In these circumstances, the combined operations of the two societies would fully ensure our interests and those of Harriman.

1 To Comrade Molotov (for Politbureau members) I have just received two letters from Chicherin (dated the 20th and 22nd).
He has raised the question of whether we should agree, for a proper compensation, to some small changes in our Constitution, namely, representation for the parasitic elements on the Soviets.
He says this should be done to please the Americans.
This proposal of Chicherin shows, I believe, that he should 1) be immediately sent to a sanatorium, as any con-nivance in this respect, any allowance of delay, etc.
, will, in my opinion, be the greatest threat to all negotiations.
* 2) This shows how timely my proposal (which I here enclose) is to have a formulation at once of our prelimi-nary and approximate, but precise terms, for all members of the Genoa delegation.

* You are entirely to blame for this incredible red tape.
I find it ridiculous to read that you cannot see your way to agreeing to the withdrawal of my report on the economic situation.
Unfortunately, my illness cannot accord with this.
Unless you prepare another rapporteur in good time, the blame will fall entirely on you.
I have not received any reply to my proposal to let Pyatakov give this report, although I made this proposal to Kamenev and you many days ago.
** I began writing an article on this subject, but I now see that I can in no way guarantee its completion in time.
556 You are certainly right about the Mensheviks that the reply must be absolutely negative.
I think that you, too, are at fault on this point with unwarranted indulgence.
For instance, it was decided not to release Rozh-kov.
But he has been released without any Politbureau decision.
557 I think that nothing but harm will come of such a policy.

MOLOTOV Comrade Molotov Comrade Molotov: The papers say that an emergency conference of heads of gubernia and regional public education departments has been set for 20/III.
I think that the following circular telegram, signed by you and me, should be issued: “Every gubernia and regional department of public edu-cation is hereby bound to send in with their delegate or by mail for the conference precise and detailed information about outstanding local public educators of gubernia departments.
This should include the delegates to theconference.
Information about each should contain his de-tailed record before the revolution and since, and a reference from local gubernia executive committees and local Gubernia Party Committees.
The number of workers to be covered by such information—at least 2 Party and 2 non-Party men for each gubernia.
“Non-fulfilment or improper fulfilment of this proposal shall entail responsibility in Party and Soviet government procedures.
563 In addition to this telegram, I propose the demand that Comrade Litkens should also submit reports on at least 10 workers of the People’s Commissariat for Public Education among those who have been most outstanding at the centre in the last few years or months.
I consider all these reports to be absolutely necessary, because the People’s Commissariat for Education has been quite incapable of enlisting workers from the localities, whereas we must find candidates for it to renew the Collegium.

DIRECTIVES FOR THE SOVIET DELEGATION AT THE GENOA CONFERENCE 7/II.
Comrade Chicherin: All your numerous assumptions are, I think, basically incorrect and spring, so to say, from polemical ardour.
565 The directives do not say that we should not agree to cover in any form whatsoever any random claims of the adversary with our own counter-claims.
The chairman of the delegation (and the deputy chairman, in this case) seems to have a host of powers, which gives him almost autocratic power.
Your letter (and Krasin’s even more so) shows—rather showed—signs of panic.
That is the most dangerous thing.
We are not the least bit afraid of a break-down: we shall have an even better conference tomorrow.
Isolation and blockade will no longer intimidate us, nor will interven-tion.
We are proposing a broad agenda, and are hinting at our own “palliative” programme of general measures.
Suppose they reject it? As they please! (we might publish our extensive pro-gramme on behalf of some member of the delegation, who may even resign (with the C.
C.
’s consent, of course).
You do not want an extensive one, let’s have a narrower one: Wir nehmen auch Abschlagszahlung! * We shall accept even the narrowest one, but we shall not accept anything disadvantageous.
We shall not submit to ultimatums.
If you want only “to trade”—let’s have it, but we shall not buy a pig in a poke, and will not make any deal without calculating any “claims” to the last kopek.
That is all.
* We also accept payment by instalments!—Ed.
We must prepare and deploy all our guns—there will always be time enough to decide which are to he used as a show, and which are to be fired off and when.

D.
Tsyurupa Comrade Sokolnikov: 1) Gorbunov has told you about Belov.
We have the best references about Belov both on the Party side and on the commercial side.
I feel that unless we give support to our “own” businessmen of this caliber, we shall be doing nothing but talk and talk.
Those guilty of delays and red tape (at the State Bank) must be punished.
Otherwise there will be no results.
(Gorbunov has the references.
) 2) The foreign trade theses have been pickled.
A long, long time ago, I gave this two or three days.
Such delays should not be allowed to go unpunished.
3) Has any thought been given to the ways and means of bringing to book members of trust boards for incorrect accounting and for operating business at a loss* ? I wonder if our People’s Commissariat for Justice is asleep? This calls for a number of model trials with the application of the fiercest chastisement.
It looks as though the P.

4) In Smolensk Gubernia private capital is said to have beaten the co-operatives, and driven them to closure.
What about prosecutions for illegal trade? What about taxes on private trade? etc.
, etc.
The Soviet bureaucrats have also missed all this? Who at your place is responsible for this? Perhaps, we should set up commissions 1) from the People’s Commissariat for P Finance N for supervision 2) ” ” People’s Commissariat for M measures Justice N Q 3) anyone else * See present edition, Vol.

YENUKIDZE Comrade Yenukidze: From talks and reports here in Moscow, I conclude that there is something like slackness in the Presidium of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
and its work.
This is not surprising, be-cause all its members are loaded with 20 jobs, as is the practice in our “Oblomov” * republic.
This tends to strengthen the influence of men like Larin.
He is a good fellow—as poet, as journalist, as lecturer.
But we are fools to appoint him to legislative work, thereby spoiling and ruining both him and the job.
For Christ’s sake, keep a stricter watch over him.
Keep Larin in check.
If he has already got somewhere, do not believe any of his plans or projects—do not let any pass without a triple check-up.
See that there is not the usual chaos, when efforts are made to get something through the Presidium of the All-Russia C.

II.
1922 Comrade Molotov: Having filled in the questionnaire or the form of the last census of R.
C.
P.
members, 5 6 9 I have come to the firm conclusion that the business of statistics at the C.
C.
(and probably, the whole of the registration and distribu-tion) is very poorly organised.
Either we have a fool in charge of statistics, or there are fools and pedants sitting in important posts somewhere in these “departments” (if the said institutions under the C.
C.
are so called), and you have apparently no time to look into what they are doing.
1 .
The head of the Statistical Department should be fired.
2.
This and the Registration and Distribution depart-ments must be given a thorough shake-up.
Otherwise, we ourselves (“combating red tape”.
.
.
) breed the most disgraceful and stupid red tape under our very noses.
The C.
C.
has vast powers.
Its possibilities are gigantic.
We are distributing 200,000-400,000 Party workers, and through them thousands upon thousands of non-Party men.
And this gigantic communist undertaking is being dead ruined by stupid red tape! All the censuses must be finished in a month.
Their processing should be reduced to a minimum, so as also to complete it within a month.
After that nine-tenths of the Statistical and an equal proportion of the Registration and Distribution departmentsof the C.
C.
should be disbanded, and their organisation started anew.
You yourself should get rid of minor problems (shift them on to your assistants and assistants’ assistants) to concentrate entirely on the business of being a political secretary and superintendent directing the work of organi-sation, registration, etc.
Has there been a census of “responsible workers”? The result likewise appears to be a zero; it is worse, probably being a minus.
Write or phone me, and we shall talk it over in greater detail.
We need cards for several hundred (for a start) leading Party workers, classifying them as propagandists, admin-istrators, agitators, teachers, etc.
, and containing refer-ences about their work (say, a record of the last five posts) given by such-and-such (4-6) persons.
We have been chasing after thousands and hundreds of thousands, trifling our time away bureaucratically, without learning to place these men.

1922 Comrade Chicherin: A telegram from Krasin dated 13.

1466/c) says (Lloyd George): “If the Soviet Government refuses to recognise the Cannes resolutions that will threaten the break-down of the entire conference and will, in any case, make it easier for Poincaré to walk out.
.
.
.
” That is formulated more “threateningly” than accurately! But the whole British press, judging by our papers, has made frequent statements to the effect that the invitation to the Genoa Conference does not require and never has re-quired the preliminary acceptance of the Cannes terms and that the contrary opinion held by the French is-an incor-rect one.
All the material must be collected to establish precise and formally indisputable facts.
It seemed to me that three facts were indisputable: (1) when we were invited it was not required that we make a precise, clear and formal declaration of acceptance of the Cannes terms;(2) we did not make any such declaration in our reply, and we have not been informed that our reply is incomplete; (3) the entire British bourgeois press in its dispute with the French recognised that the preliminary acceptance of the Cannes terms is not obligatory.

* After reading, please, return to N.
P.
Gorbunov: 1) I very strongly suspect that Koblents is poor, and that the whole of this department is poor too.
Koblents has clearly “forgotten” that an enterprise leased from the Soviet power is still a Soviet enterprise; 2) — — confused the question about subsequent or prelim-inary audit with the question of whether or not it is liable to auditing at all; 3) he has apparently “forgotten” that the rights of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection are not narrower than the State Control’s old powers (Collection of Statutes, 1920, No.
16); he has forgotten many other things as well.
Conclusion: Koblents’s opinion must be checked up, and if a careful study shows that Koblents has told a lie, he should be replaced by a more solid lawyer.
Let me know whom you will appoint as responsible for this check-up.
— — — If our laws are “contradictory” (of which there is no doubt), what are the People’s Commissariat for Justice and the Legislative Proposals Department for? * See Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.

YAKOVENKO Comrade Yakovenko, People’s Commissariat for Agriculture On January 26, Izvestia VTsIK carried an article by Comrade A.
Belyakov entitled “Yearning Motors and Pro-letarian Agriculture”.

It turns out that 770 brand new motors with spare parts, in good condition, in their foreign packaging, with a total of almost 117,000 h.
p.
, and costing over 14 million pre-war gold rubles, have been lying about at the war department for five years.
These motors are of no use to the War De-partment, and are being handed over by it to the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture, which can very well use them for the needs of agriculture.
It is four months now since the P.

those guilty of delays and red tape should be found, and a trial of this business should be arranged with wide publicity; 3.

At the end of last December, I wrote to the People’s Commissariat for Education about Prof.
Krug’s request to provide the Moscow Higher Technical College with premises for its electrotechnical department and Electrotech-nical Institute, and asked that special attention should be given to it, and everything done to meet the request.
* On February 9, I received another letter from Prof.
Krug, in which he says that the People’s Commissariat for Edu-cation has not yet helped the College.
Prof.
Krug says that it would be quite possible, without causing any incon-venience at all, by way of more efficient use of space by others, to give the electrotechnical department and the Experimental Electrotechnical Institute some of the premises of the former Yelizavetinsky Institute, and have the Radishchev School, now housed at the Institute, trans-ferred to another place by the spring, when the warm weather sets in.
If you do not agree with this proposal of Prof.
Krug’s—I instruct you on your personal responsibility to find and make available to the Institute premises within a fort-night.
Inform me of execution by March 3.

I have made a point of looking into this business, and I must say that according to my information this is an exception-aliy important undertaking which must be supported by way of exception at any cost.

TSYURUPA 18/II.
1 Comrade Tsyurupa: When I was writing my book on imperialism, * I read about two systems for state banks (and banks in general) in the capitalist countries.
One of the systems—the State Bank’s great proximity to trade.
Perhaps we should get a couple of our “fin-scholars” (I feel like making a pun—fie-scholars?) to make a study of this question.
We need a State Bank which is a hundred times closer to trade than the most commercial of the state banks of capitalism.
Our State Bank must have a network of com-mercial agents, starting from the top (something like a travelling bank inspector for commerce, in charge of thou-sands of millions in turnover) and ending with small and very small commercial agents at the bottom.
If this whole network operates on the commission system and learns (and teaches us) to trade well, we shall have control of nine-tenths of the total amount of the trade turnover.
This is the only way to restore the gold circulation and to transform the New Economic Policy from a system of fooling communist fools, who hold power but are incapable of using it, into a base for socialism, a base which, this being a peasant country, no power on earth can vanquish.
* Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (see present edi-tion, Vol.
22, pp.
185-304).

I be-lieve that we should concentrate all our efforts on this and secure the introduction of commission fees, veri fi-cation by practice, and the expulsion from the State Bank’s Trade Department of everything that is flabby, everything that is not commercial, everything that is unable to secure success in trade.
We do not need a “department for internal trade” (we have enough of such sh.
.
as departments), but one or two dozen men at the State Bank who know how to trade (and teach others to do so).
This is crucial, without this the monetary system cannot be put straight.

It was also my own fault, because you had repeatedly asked me whether I was tired or not.

Possible extraction worth .
.

million gold rubles α) now β) with additional expenditure of .
.
.
million gold rubles over a period of .

years (separately for Kyshtym, Ridder, Ekibastuz, Tanalyk).
2.
Shall we manage without the concessionaire (probably) or not? if not, why? α) due to lack of capital? β) due to the impossibility of buying and bringing in first-class equipment? γ) due to the impossibility of employing first-class engineers? δ) due to the impossibility of buying and bringing in foodstuffs? clothes? workers? or for any other (which?) reasons? 3.
Conclusion: α) shall we accept Urquhart’s terms? β) modify them? how? γ) reject them altogether? You must first manage (swiftly) to catch all the mem-bers of the commission separately, and get their written replies to these questions.
Then let me know the results, and after this we shall put pressure on the S.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY 22/II.
Secret Comrade Krzhizhanovsky: In one of his letters to the C.
C.
, Comrade Trotsky writes about the failure of our planning organs.
This is true insofar as, for instance, the administrative side of the work at Gosplan * is definitely not organised.
The personal responsibility of every member of Gosplan for such-and-such (principal) functions has not been estab-lished.
There is no distribution between Gosplan members of the work of “general supervision” over the plan’s ful-filment, without which everything = 0.
Etc.
Conclusion: we must hasten with the draft decisions (let’s have them as soon as possible), both about Gosplan’s staffs and its Presidium (of 15 men?? I think this will make it worse, because then there will be even less personal responsibility), and the 3-man Presidium Bureau (]et’s see your arguments: I think this Bureau should be the Presid-ium itself).
I wonder who could substitute for Pyatakov for a time (until 15.
V)? The three members of the Bureau (if the C.
C.
confirms three: you & Pyatakov & Osadchy) should set up the admin-istrative section anew.
If Pyatakov & Osadchy are to be the administrators, they will answer with their heads for any “slip” (failure to appoint some Gosplan member to do such-and-such a job, failure to check up on his work, failure to bring some shortage to notice in good time, etc.
).

About Peshekhonov, I propose that the Politbureau adopt the following decision: 1) instruct Popov to give him work involving trade and sanitary statistics, and no other; 2) im-pose on Popov personally the responsibility to see that Peshekhonov keeps out of politics; 3) inform Popov of §§ 1 and 2 orally, against his signature, without giving him any paper, with the serious warning that if he di-vulges this, he will be dismissed and prosecuted; 4) set Un-schlicht the task of keeping a strict watch on Peshekhonov; 5) issue a reprimand to the Kharkov Gubernia Committee and the Ukrainian C.

1 Comrades Stalin and Kamenev Please reply on this memo: 1.
Do you agree with Chicherin about the immediate payment to the Turks of what has been promised? 591 2.
I have read Chicherin’s proposal concerning the pre-sidium of the Genoa delegation.
I resolutely question this and insist on my earlier proposal.
592 Please, make a note here of your opinion on both points and pass it on to me through my secretary.
Lenin2 Comrades Stalin and Kamenev Today I read in tho papers Italy’s announcement con-cerning the postponement of the Genoa Conference.
I maintain with especial vigour the proposal I sent yes-terday: authorise Chicherin to send as soon as possible a highly acid Note, proposing that the exact date should be set for March 15.
* Show the draft Note to the Polit-bureau members before its dispatch.
I am awaiting your reply through my secretary.

CHICHERIN 593 Comrade Chicherin or Litvinov Copy to Comrade Molotov (for Politbureau members) February 25, 1922 Having read, apart from the telegrams, the leaders in today’s newspapers, I come to the conclusion that the Note concerning the postponement of the Genoa Conference without any indication of date should be couched in the most insolent and derisive tone, so that the people at Genoa should feel the slap in the face.
It looks as though the only way to create an actual impression is to be super-insolent.
In particular, we could say that among our counter-claims we include the expenses incidental to the fact that these powers have failed to fulfil their initial obliga-tion—to convene the conference at the appointed time.
We must not miss the opportunity when we can, through an insolent and mocking Note, help bring about a situation * See present edition, Vol.

To Comrade Pyatakov Comrade Morozov Comrades Zaks and Gorbunov.
Comrade Pyatakov, acting head of GUT, should not have “requested me to believe” (his paper of 22/II) or “requested me either to satisfy Gidrotorf over and above the estimates, or allow a reduction of its activity”—such a “request” addressed to me is failure to understand the elements of state relations—he should have given thought as to how to fulfil the C.

If Pyatakov had not been informed of this decision, it is necessary to arrest the numerous GUT specialists and red tapists, whose duty it was to know, to inquire, and to give Pyatakov a reminder.
Not to put such scoundrels under arrest is to encourage red tape, which is stifling us.
The C.

decision of 30.

1920 makes it clear that, finding himself in a quandary, Pyatakov should not have written an empty paper No.

decision of 30.
X.
1920, which binds all People’s Commissariats in fact to recognise Gidrotorf as “being of exceptional state importance”, and apply “all privileges” to it.

Comrade Morozov should have urgently requested the convocation of such a conference (and complained about any delay), instead of writing a purely squabbling piece of paper on 22.

C.
WITH REMARKS ON THE THESES OF THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSAR FOR FINANCE To Comrade Molotov for the Politbureau members March 3, 1922 Sokolnikov’s theses (“Basic Provisions of the Financial Programme”) are, I think, not bad, but on the theoretical side.
I am making a special study of one point (beginning of §12) and shall write about it separately.
For the rest, I propose: submit for opinion to the State Planning Commission, Preobrazhensky and Krasnoshchekov.
Then print with cuts (for the time being throw out the point on substituting the cash tax for the tax in kind, etc.
).
Now, on the substance of the matter.
I think these two things are pivotal: 1) how to find fierce and clever men for harassing all the People’s Commissariats (plus the Moscow, plus the Petrograd Soviets): reduce staffs in practice and severely; 2) how to teach our bureaucratic “torgs” (including the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, Mostorg, Petro-torg, etc.
, etc.
) to trade instead of engaging in red tape.
Perhaps we should authorise the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
Pre-sidium to adopt this decision: All People’s Commissariats plus the Moscow and Petro-grad Soviets shall have the duty to submit within a week a draft decision transferring their staffs (all who are con-nected with economics) to percentage payments from turnover and from profits, with fierce penalties for losses, flabbiness and bungling, and with the obligation to reply to commercial inquiries within 3-6 hours, under penalty of prison terms of not less than 5 years.
For the best draft decision—a prize of 100,000 gold rubles, to be paid after a year’s successful trial of the de-cision, so that payment is proportional to the success (100% success= 100% prize, 1% success= 1% prize).

KAMENEV 606 3.
III.
1922 Comrade Kamenev: I have been thinking for some time about our talk (with you, Stalin and Zinoviev) on Vneshtorg * and the Krasin and the Sokolnikov line.
My conclusion is that Krasin is absolutely right.
We cannot now afford to retreat on our foreign trade monopoly beyond what Lezhava has proposed and is proposing in his theses.
Otherwise, foreigners will buy up and carry away everything that is valuable.
Here and in all of his work, Sokolnikov is making a great mistake, which is sure to ruin us, unless the C.
C.
corrects his line in time, and actually secures implementa-tion of the corrected line.
His mistake is abstract enthu-siasm for a scheme (something of which Sokolnikov has always been guilty, as a talented journalist and a politician who is easily carried away).
An example: Sokolnikov has proposed a draft decree on importing foreign foodstuffs to Russia.
In the decree he says, in passing: as for the “guar-antees”, special provision will be made for them (i.
e.
, guarantees that the values taken out of Russia allegedly in exchange for foodstuffs do really and entirely go for food).
This is downright childishness! The whole point is in the guarantees, and it is this point that Sokolnikov “puts off”, shrugging it off with an empty phrase or a pious wish.
What are the real guarantees? Is it to be a pledge? Just think what this means: 1) I want to buy 100,000 gold rubles’ worth of food-stuffs abroad.
I deposit this amount at the State Bank ax a pledge? In that case, all the red tape is still there (unless we “teach” Vneshtorg & Co.
how to get rid of the red tape).
Furthermore, where are the “guarantees” that in remit-ting 100,000 gold rubles abroad, I am not remitting 20,000 * The People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.
—Ed.
gold rubles of them fictitiously? A check-up on the prices? By whom? How? This is a bureaucratic utopia! Sokolnikov’s project shows that our kind, talented and most valuable Comrade Sokolnikov knows nothing at all about practical commerce.
And it is going to ruin us if it is set in motion.
It is the greatest mistake to think that NEP has put an end to terrorism.
We shall yet return to terrorism, and it will be an economic terrorism.
The foreigners are already buying up our officials with bribes, and “carting out what there is left of Russia”.
They may well succeed.
Monopoly is a polite warning: my dear sirs, the time will come when I shall hang you for this.
The foreigners, knowing that the Bolsheviks are in earn-est, have to reckon with this seriously.
That is why 1 ) the foreign trade monopoly should not be undermined, in any case; 2) Lezhava’s theses should be adopted not later than tomorrow; 3) publish right away (we have lost heaps of time), on behalf of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
Presidium, a firm, cold, fierce statement that we do not intend to retreat in the economy any farther, and that those who attempt to cheat us (or circumvent the monopoly, etc.
) will face terrorism; this word should not be used, but the likelihood of it should be “hinted at subtly and politely”.
If this is not done through the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
Presid-ium, it can be done otherwise (a letter of mine? that is worse!); but it needs to be done and fast.
Then, here is an example.
The Moscow Gubernia Economic Conference offers to buy tinned food (or any kind of food) for Soviet rubles.
The talks with Vneshtorg last for two weeks.
It objects.
The deal falls through.
Conclusion? Are we to give the Gubernia Economic Conference the necessary rights? This would mean “duplicating” a bad Vneshtorg with bad little Vneshtorgs, of which the capital-ists will buy up 90 per cent.
Another conclusion: stop this game of decrees (there was an indispensable period of propaganda by decree; that was necessary for the success of the revolution.
This is over).
There should not be the slightest trust in decrees or institutions.
The only thing is to verify practice and take people to task for red tape.
That is the only thing clever people should engage in.
Anything else should entail .
.
.
prison for the rest.
Here is what I would propose: authorise the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
Presidium to adopt the following decision right away: In view of the scandalous red tape on the deal (such-and-such) involving the purchase of food for Soviet rubles, order the State Political Administration (they need a little scaring!) to find those guilty of red tape and incarcerate for 6 hours those working for the Moscow Gubernia Eco-nomic Conference, and for 36 hours those working at Vnesh-torg (of course, with the exception of All-Russia C.
E.
C.
members: after all, we enjoy almost parliamentary im-munity).
After this, instruct the press to ridicule both groups and pour dirt on them.
For the disgraceful thing here is that Muscovites (in Moscow!) have failed to cope with the red tape.
For this they should be beaten with a stick.
They “did not know how” to send a telephone message saying: “urgent advantageous deal.
Demand Vneshtorg’s reply within 3 hours.
Copy to Molotov for the C.
C.
, to Tsyu-rupa and Yenukidze for the C.
P.
C.
and the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
” No reply within 3 hours? Another 4 lines of complaint by phone.
But we find these idiots walking around and talking for two weeks! They deserve to be left to rot in gaol instead of being given exemptions.
The Muscovites deserve 6 hours in the bughouse for stupidity.
The Vneshtorg people, 36 hours in the bughouse for stupidity plus for “central-responsibility”.
That is the only way to teach them.
Otherwise, Soviet personnel, local and central, will never learn.
We cannot afford to trade freely: that is Russia’s ruin.
But we can and will learn to transfer our red tapists on to a percentage basis: on every deal you get so much per cent (fraction of a per cent), and jail—for failure to work.
And the men at the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade need to be changed.
The same applies to our state trusts, which are “headed” by holier-than-thou members of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
and “famous” Communists, who are being duped by businessmen.
Order to the People’s Commissar for Finance: either you will manage to expel these holier-than-thou Communists from the state trusts through the State Bank (no credits; I prosecute you for delinquency, for inefficiency, etc.
), or, the whole of your People’s Commissariat for Finance and the State Bank are quite useless, being nothing but empty talk and a paper chase.
That is how the work both of the C.

I fear that they may have fictitiously blown up their liabilities, when handing them over to you.
I am passing your memo on to Gorbunov and Smolyaninov, and request you to send also to them the final exact calculation of the assets and liabilities, to enable them to tell me the results.
How are things with the loan which you were expecting before your departure, from the co-operative societies abroad? I shall be expecting short reports from you about the development of the co-operative apparatus in Russia (I have only the old figures: September—1 million, October—3, November—6 million gold rubles).
Do you now have the 10-day figures? Are there any precise data on how many gubernia societies have and have not been submitting cor-rect reports to you? Do you apply the remuneration of co-operative workers depending on the volume of their turnover and the success achieved, and expressed in a reduc-tion of the percentage cost of our apparatus? Please reply as briefly as possible to these questions and inform me in addition about any serious measures the Cen-trosoyuz Board has taken to see that our co-operative es-tablishment is truly a commercial and not a bureaucratic organ.

Dear Comrade Varga: I am ill.
I am quite incapable of undertaking any work at all.
If you compile a collection (of quotations from my works or parts of them) I do not, of course, object to this, but you must state that you are responsible for the selection.
Here is my request: 1) quote as fully as possible my works of the spring of 1918 against the “Leftists”, about “state capitalism” and the difficulties of administration, as a specific task; 2) (quote more fully) my pamphlet against “Infantile Disorder” (general rules of tactics and strategy) *; NB 3) never quote my speeches (their text is always bad, always imprecisely conveyed); quote only my works.

Then I ask you to answer this question: can you order from anyone a short (not more than 2 or 3 pages) summary of actual data characterising the development of our foreign trade over the last few months, for instance, over the last 6 months.
I would find such a thing extremely necessary for my report at the Party Congress.

The number of mixed societies set up for trade with the capitalists of various nations.

III.
1922.
Comrade Chicherin: I have read your letter of 10/III.
I think yours is an excellent exposition of the pacifist programme.
616The whole point is to have the skill to expound it and our commercial proposals loudly and clearly before the fold-up (if “they” do try to fold it up in haste).
You and our delegation have enough skill to do this.
I think you have made some 13 points (I enclose your letter with my remarks), which are excellent.
We shall have everyone intrigued by saying: “We have a most broad and comprehensive programme!” If they pre-vent us from making it public, we shall print it with our protest.
In every case we make this “little” reservation: we Com-munists have our own communist programme (the Third International); nevertheless we consider it to be our duty as businessmen to support (even if the odds are 10,000 to 1) the pacifists in the other, i.
e.
, bourgeois, camp (taking account of its Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals 617 ).
This will be “genteel” and have teeth, and will help to demoralise the enemy.
If we adopt such tactics we shall win out, even if Genoa is a failure.
We shall not accept any unprofitable deal.
With communist greetings, Yours, Lenin 14/III.
P.
S.
Comrade Chicherin: Why not add even more “genteel” bite and say the fol-lowing: We propose (§14) abolition of all war debts and (§15) revision (on the basis of the 13 §§) of the Versailles and all military treaties, 618 but not through the majority riding roughshod over the minority, but on the basis of an agreement, because in this case we are businessmen and cannot put forward any other principle here than the commercial one! We don’t want to have it all our way with the United States through a majority; we are businessmen; we want to persuade it!! A poll of all the states and an attempt to persuade those who do not agree.
This is both genteel and unacceptable to the bourgeois.
We shall disgrace and humiliate them in a very “genteel” way.
Here is a variant: submission of a minority of countries (in population) to the majority can be proposed separate-ly within each of the two camps: the bourgeois and the Soviet (the one recognising private property, and the other not recognising it).
Let us put forward both the project and the variant.
Les rieurs seront avec nous! * 9) ** an additional point: an exemption to be made for small-holders insofar as it can be precisely proved that these are not fictitious but actual toiling small-holders.
MARGINAL NOTES ON A LETTER G.
V.
CHICHERIN COMRADE LENIN March 10, 1922 Esteemed Vladimir Ilyich: I earnestly request you to read through the proposals made below and let me have your instructions.
We have to put forward “a broad pacifist programme”, that is one of the most important elements of our forthcoming act; we have not, however, got one.
We have only the separate fragmentary points in the first directives of the Central Committee.
I am here making a first attempt to approach the task.
The chief difficulty is that the present international political and economic forms serve as permanent fig-leaves covering the predatory acts of the imperialists; in par-ticular, these forms serve as a weapon against us.
The League of Nations is simply a tool of the Entente, which has already used it against us.
You have yourself pointed out that arbitration between the bourgeois and Soviet states is impossible; nevertheless arbitration is an indispensable weapon in the pacifist arsenal.
The internationalisation of the Chinese-Eastern Railway is a euphemism for its aliena-tion from us and from China and its seizure by the Entente.
A foreign bank of issue in Russia and the introduction of the dollar into Russia, like the introduction of a universal single gold unit in general, would be the most effective weapon for complete economic bondage to America.
We have to introduce something new into the customary modern international forms to prevent those forms from being turned into a tool of imperialism.
This new something is provided by our experience and our creative activity as * We shall have the last laugh.
—Ed.
This symbol is not to be found in the text.
—Ed.
well as by the creative action of life itself in the process of the growing ruin and break-up of the imperialist world.
The world war has resulted in the intensification of the liberation movement of all oppressed and colonial peoples.
World states are coming undone at the seams.
Our inter-national programme must bring all oppressed colonial peo-ples into the international scheme.
The right of all peoples to secession or to home rule must be recognised.
The Afri-can Conference of 1885 resulted in the horrors of the Bel-gian Congo, because the European powers at that confer-ence indulged in philanthropy towards the Negroes and that philanthropy turned out to be a fig-leaf covering the most barbaric exploitation.
The novelty of our international scheme must be that the Negro and other colonial peoples participate on an equal footing with the European peoples in conferences and commissions and have the right to pre-vent interference in their internal affairs.
Another novelty is the obligatory participation of working-class organisa-tions.
The demand for trade unions to take part in a future European congress was very popular in British working-class literature during the world war.
We have actually realised this by including three members of the All-Russia Central T.
U.
C.
in our delegation.
We must lay down that one-third of the votes in the international organisation we are going to propose should belong to the working-class organisations represented in each delegation.
These two novelties, however, are not sufficient to protect the oppressed peoples and downtrodden countries from the domination of the imperialists because the upper stratum of the colo-nial peoples may well be puppets in the same way as treacherous labour leaders are.
The inclusion of these two opens up the way for future struggles.
Working-class organisa-tions will be confronted with the task of struggling for the liberation of the colonial peoples, for aid to the Soviet power and against imperialist depredation.
The leaders, however, will try to betray them.
Therefore another thing to be established is the principle of non-intervention on the part of international conferences or congresses in the internal affairs of various peoples.
Voluntary co-operation and aid for the weak on the part of the strong must be ap-plied without subordinating the former to the latter.
As a result we have a very bold and completely new pro-posal—A WORLD CONGRESS with all peoples of the world participating on a completely equal footing, on the basis of the declaration of the right to self-determination, 1) true! 2) 3)the right to complete secession or home rule for all op-pressed peoples, and also with the participation of working-class organisations to the extent of one-third of the entire congress.
The purpose of the congress will not be compul-4)) cor-rect! ]] gress will help by its moral authority.
In practice it will set up technical commissions for the implementation of our ||||| ||||| ||||| ||||| pre-cisely sion of the minority but complete agreement.
The con-extensive economic programme of world-wide rehabilitation.
All the projects for a League of Nations or Association of Nations contain only two types of proposals concerning methods of compulsion to ensure fulfilment of the decisions of an Association of Nations—either the establishment of composite armies with contingents from all states or the investment of a punitive mandate in a certain power or several such powers.
In the first case we would have some-thing incompetent because a composite army made up of contingents from numerous countries is of no use.
In the second case the League of Nations or Association of Nations is nothing but an excuse to justify fresh conquests by the more influential powers.
And so it is essential to eliminate completely the element of compulsion or punitive expedi-tions and leave to the World Congress only its moral author-ity, allowing it to be an arena for discussions aimed at reach-ing agreement.
The prevention of war is a matter for arbitration.
There are two types of arbitration—the volun-tary appeal of the two parties to an arbiter, to The Hague Tribunal, for instance—in such cases the decision of the arbiter is binding—or the second method, an example of which is to be found in the article on arbitration contained in the treaty between Great Britain and the United States according to which, in the event of there being a danger of war, special conciliation commissions are set up to which the two parties must appeal but whose decision is merely advisory although for a definite period, for instance a year, the proceedings of the commissions continue; this second method has as its purpose the postponement of the begin-ning of military action to enable the passions of both par-ties to subside in the legally established interval and les-sen the conflict.
In the first case appeal to the arbiter is not obligatory but decisions are binding.
In the second case appeal to the arbiter is obligatory but decisions are not binding, and the parties are bound only for the legally established period.
At the present moment we cannot avoid this alternative.
The proposed World Congress could take over The Hague Tribunal with its advisory arbitration and other services.
We shall, however, consider that the only court of arbitration between a capitalist state and the Soviet state can be that(5) in which an equal number of members is appointed by each 5) party so that half the members will be imperialists and half will be Communists.
At the same time we shall propose a gen-(6) eral reduction of armaments based on the theses we have 6) established with the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic; developing the traditions of The Hague and Geneva conventions we shall propose adding a number of pro-hibitions to the rules of war—the abolition of submarines,7) chemical gases, mortars, flame-throwers and armed air battles.
The technical commissions set up by the World Congress8) will guide the implementation of a broad programme of world-wide rehabilitation.
This programme will not be im-posed by force.
It will be a voluntary proposal that appeals to the advantage of every participant.
Aid will be given to the weak.
In this way world railways, river and sea9) routes must be laid down.
The internationalisation of those routes will be a matter of gradual development since the compulsion of those who resist will not be allowed.
International technical commissions will propose to indi-vidual countries economic and technical aid for the crea-tion of super-main lines, for the regulation of traffic on international rivers, for the use of international harbours and for the technical improvement of world sea routes.
We shall propose that the capital of the advanced countries should build a super-main line London-Moscow-Vladivostok (Peking) and we shall explain that it will open up the in-calculable wealth of Siberia for the use of all.
In general, aid from the strong for the weak will be the basic principle of world rehabilitation which must be based on economic geography and the planned distribution of resources.
A world gold unit can make its appearance only as a result of the improvement of the economically weak countries with the aid of the strong: this improvement is in the interest of all since world ruin affects the strong countries as well, giving rise to unparalleled unemployment, even in America.
The strong, by helping the weak, are opening up for themselves markets and sources of raw materials.
Proceeding from these premises we shall propose the planned distribution of the gold that is at the moment lying idle in the vaults of the American banks.
This planned distribution of gold 10) 11)in all countries must be combined with the planned distri-bution of orders, trade, supplies of scarce materials, in general, with all-round economic aid for the ruined coun-12) tries.
This aid may take the form of loans, since under a planned economy the return of the money would begin in a few years.
Under this heading we place the Barter Insti-tute plan (Keynes), or the Zentralstelle, or national trade centres.
If Germany opposes us by a single Zentralstelle in place of individual merchants it will be bad for us since it would be a means of imposing bad goods on us at high prices.
If, however, the Zentralstellen are instruments for the planned, world-wide distribution of essential commod-13) ities and a means of rendering aid to weak countries by the strong, they would be essential components of an exten-sive programme of economic rehabilitation.
The grain sent to us by America is the beginning of the international dis-tribution of food.
Within the Entente there was a partial-ly planned distribution of fuel during the war; one of the chief elements of the broad programme should be the sys-tematic distribution of oil and coal, but in this case, too, the element of compulsion and repression must be elimi-nated.
The international technical commissions must elaborate, in very general outline, a programme for the planned distribution of fuel and energy resources.
All these points, taken together, provide a picture of what is theoret-ically possible under the bourgeois system, but which in historically conditioned reality will come up against national egoism and the predatory acts of the capitalist oligarchy.

Lezhava is a very nice comrade, but he has fully demonstrated his weakness.
There is need for a different collegium (Politbureau), and a trio inside it: you & Frumkin & Radchenko, because you are away very often, and authority should reside in Russia.
What is more, you are also a diplomat.
And you are not doing any of the spade-work, purging the swin-dlers, seeing to the order, flogging and thrashing for non-fulfilment.
You are responsible for the direction, but thespade-work needs strong-minded men, and not Lezhava.

1922.
Comrades Frumkin and Radchenko: In a talk with me yesterday, Comrade Krasin expressed the fear that both of you are freetraders, which is why the future of the foreign-trade monopoly is being predetermined in a negative sense.
I protested most vigorously; I referred to the fact that both of you are old Party men, tried and tested in every way, and that there was not the slightest ground for assuming that an absolutely precise directive from the C.
C.
Politbureau (which confirmed the theses recognising the foreign-trade monopoly) could be unful-filled by you.
In addition, I expressed great doubt about Comrade Frumkin being a “freetrader”.
If Comrade Rad-chenko had earlier spoken out (something I, too, had heard from him) in the sense that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade could “not cope” with the monopoly, what he had in mind, first, was the unsatisfactory apparatus of the P.
C.
F.
T.
, which is the very thing we are now going to improve, and, second, apparently, the “absolute” monopoly of foreign trade, now substituted by a liberal monopoly, a monopoly unconditionally and in any case.
I consider it my duty to inform you about that talk with Krasin.
Write me a couple of words.
I hope that on the basis of “mixed societies”, if we all, you especially, see to it that there are no “compuppets”, communist puppets, up there on top for the sake of appearances, while special-ists, swindlers, etc.
, handle all the business—that on this basis we shall restructure the whole economy of trade andrestructure it precisely in the way necessary to ensure socialist construction.

FRUMKIN Comrade Frumkin: I had just finished writing to you and Radchenko, * when I received your letter.
625 I cannot agree with you.
The Politbureau decision is precise, clear and, I believe, cor-rect.
What are your “differences of principle with Krasin”?? I should like to know.
Are there any? What are they about? Which are they? Even if there are any in fact, that is no hindrance.
With Stomonyakov, you and Radchenko will make ar-rangements here, now.
You and Radchenko will each travel abroad at least once a year.
It is not far from here to Berlin, and Berlin is the centre.

1922 To Comrade Molotov for Politbureau members I have had a talk with Krasnoshchekov.
I see that we, the Politbureau, have made a big mistake.
We have harassed this man, who undoubtedly has brains, energy, knowledge and experience, to a state when one is quite capable of abandoning everything and getting away from the whole thing.
He knows all the languages, English excellently.
He has been in the movement since 1896.
Fifteen years in America.
Started out as a house-painter.
Was headmaster of a school.
Knows commerce.
Has shown himself to be an intelligent chairman of the government in the Far-Eastern Republic, where he organised virtually everything.
630 We took him away from there.
Here we placed him in the People’s Commissariat for Finance, where complete anar-chy reigns.
Now, just when he was down with the typhus, he has been dismissed!!! We have done everything possible and impossible to repulse this highly energetic, intelligent and valuable worker.
He has had differences both with the People’s Commissar-iat for Foreign Trade and the People’s Commissariat for Finance, because he favoured greater “freedom to trade”.
He says: “Let me prove myself at work, allow me to complete it without keeping on at me.
” That is, of course, a legitimate desire.
We must make efforts to give him a job at the S.
E.
C.
At any rate, we must strive at all costs not to lose this worker, but to meet his most legitimate desire: give him a specified job and allow him, say, at least one year of trial, to test him without harassing him.
(He says he is willing to work anywhere, provided he is not pulled about.
) (He would like to work at the People’s Commissariat forForeign Affairs.
He has had some differences with Chicherin on the foreign policy of the Far-Eastern Republic.

Comrade Tsyurupa has been assigned the task of seeing that these instructions are carried out.

1922 Comrade Rykov: Please see to the business indicated by Comrade Mar-tens.
631 If it is confirmed that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs had impeded things, they should be given exemplary punishment.
Of course, we should be very cautious about the immigration of workers to Russia, for, on the other hand, we have very inadequate experience.
When all the formalities in the restrictive sense have beenobserved, it is downright criminal to allow any delays, for if the economic work is to be started, the immigrants must arrive just now, before the spring operations begin.

1922 Comrade Rykov: I am sending on to you a letter from Yezhov, 632 who has been recommended to me as an extremely reliable and ef-ficient worker.
Unfortunately, I have been unable to carry out my intention of making a closer acquaintance with him.
The warehouse business is in a shocking state and, I believe, the whole is in the charge of Troyanovsky, whom I remember as a Bolshevik during my stay abroad.
Sub-sequently, he went over to the Mensheviks, and now, it seems, has deviated from the Mensheviks.
I strongly suspect that he is doing nothing about the warehouses, but is en-gaged in politics, and that nothing good will come of his warehouse activity.
I think that Troyanovsky’s efficiency should he thoroughly checked.

Com-rade Krzhizhanovsky has informed me, that, according to the engineers with whom he has talked, it has been virtually proved that we have there an incredibly rich reserve of pure iron.
Comrade Martens believes that it has been proved already.
He intends to go there within three weeks.
We must discuss whether we should send along with him some engineer from the State Planning Commission with a better * See Document 503 of this volume.

I think we should not let the press have any information about this and should take steps to see that nothing is said about this in the press, because otherwise we may expect that the interventionist plans may very well be intensi-fied.
For the same reason, perhaps, it would be better not to have Martens’s report made either to the C.

confirms that the matter is serious, we must get the work going as fast as possible, without in any case stinting the necessary gold appropria-tions, and establishing special supervision to have the necessary equipment received from abroad (diamond, drill-ing, etc.
) with the maximum speed.
I very much fear that this business will be carried out without sufficient energy.
But the fact is, according to Krzhizhanovsky and Martens, that we have there almost surely a stock of wealth un-equalled anywhere in the world, and capable of revolution-ising the whole of metallurgy.

I have known Comrade Adoratsky (and I know him well) since the post-1905 period of reaction.
In face of the trend to the right, he was a Bolshevik al-ready at the time, and has remained one.
He arrived from Germany in 1919 in very poor health.
He is a theorist and propagandist.

Am I to confine myself to theory and politics, or devote some space to letters shedding light on Marx’s life, and being of interest for a biography? I think this is not necessary.

C.
directive.
The mistake consists in the fact that Chicherin, without achieving any-thing in practice, could well deprive us of the only ex-planation of a break-up which is quite advantageous and important in principle and which gives us a sure gain in the future: namely, a break-up over our refusal to restore the private property of foreign capitalists.
I propose, therefore, that the Politbureau members should be polled by phone today, and that the following telegram should be sent on my behalf: “To Chicherin for all the members of the delegation “I consider Rudzutak’s opinion, stated in his telegram of April 22, to be quite correct.
I regard as a very dangerous mistake any step and any phrase capable of depriving us of the only advantageous ground for a break-up, which, be-sides, assures us of complete diplomatic and commercial victory in the very near future, namely, the ground that we absolutely refuse to restore the private property of the foreign capitalists.
“I repeat once again that we have communicated to you the absolutely exact text of our maximum concessions, from which we will not depart in the least.
As soon as it becomes quite clear that agreement on the basis of these concessions is impossible, we authorise you to break-off, retaining for agitation and for a subsequent diplomatic offen-sive two trumps: “1) The fundamental importance of the Russo-German treaty.
“2) Our divergence on the question of restoring the capitalists’ property.
” Please, let me know the opinion of all or at any rate of a majority of the Politbureau members.
645 At 7 o’clock tonight let us meet together, and if pos-sible with Kamenev as well, for a quarter of an hour.

SECRETARIAT Comrade Stalin: I am sending on to you a letter from Comrade Shklovsky (G.
L.
Shklovsky).
I knew him very well while abroad (1908-1914), where he emigrated being already a Bolshevik and a Party member.
He wants to work in Russia and in the Party.
He used to work in Moscow—in the city adminis-tration (Vladimirsky saw him on the job), and at the Peo-ple’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and at the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture; it seems he quite “hit it off” only with the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Af-fairs, where he was valued.
In the other places he was either not in tune or not in full tune, or something of that sort, for it turned out that it was impossible for him to arrange for work in Russia.
Shklovsky is a veteran Party man, and he is extremely upset (as his letter shows) that he is “not being allowed” to work in Russia.
He is nervous, he has fears that he is being “put off”, etc.
(He has a family and children; it is not easy to adapt oneself to cold and starv-ing Russia.
Both Zinoviev and Safarov and all those who were in Switzerland in 1908-1917 knew Shklovsky abroad.
) Please write yourself or have your secretary write to Shklovsky (through Krestinsky in Berlin), asking him what he would like, and then raise the question in the Secretar-iat.
People should not be “squandered”, he should be given the closest attention.

In view of such hesitations we order the delegation to break uncon-ditionally and as soon as possible, clearly and precisely motivating it by the refusal to restore private property, and to declare that we agreed to make partial concessions only on condition of a very advantageous and immediate loan, unconditionally insisting on a treaty between two systems of property, as between equals.

SOKOLNIKOV ON QUESTIONS OF FINANCIAL POLICY Copies to Comrades Tsyurupa, Rykov and Stalin (for the Politbureau) Comrade Sokolnikov: I have heard Comrade Tsyurupa’s account of your project for an internal grain loan, and have looked over the draft text myself.
This looks to me like self-deception.
How can you prove that this will yield anything practical at all? It seems to me that, on the contrary, we should con-clude that this will worsen our situation by wrecking the emission, i.
e.
, inducing the speculative market to resort to the very measure of fighting against us which it has been using with such success.
In fact, the market has learned, it seems, to inflate prices following the growth of emission so fast that the emission has ceased to extract any real values from the population whatsoever, becoming an empty game and empty self-consolation on our part.
(By the way, there should be precise data about the real values being extracted through the emission.
They should be summed up in the briefest form at least weekly.
Is this being done?) I think it is time we abandoned the harmful self-conso-lation, and turned to really revolutionary measures, on the one hand—an increase in the collection of all taxes; on the other hand—a most rapid and vigorous reduction of staffs.
In doing this, we should not stop at closing down, partly without any designation of date, partly until the autumn, of a number of the largest departments in some People’s Commissariats, and even of this or that People’s Commissariat.
I wrote to Dzerzhinsky today to check up on whether we are seriously working to close down the third category railways.
I very much fear that without revolutionary measures of this kind the congress resolution on financial policy 655 remains on paper, and that in general we arelagging behind life, risking to find ourselves helpless in face of the impending disaster.
Let me have your opinion.

STALIN This telegram has been directed to the Politbureau quite wrongly.
This matter should be decided through Soviet government channels.
Such a telegram must be dispatchedwith the signature of both deputy chairmen, the chairman or deputy chairman of the Concessions Committee and, finally, the head of the Central Fuel Administration.
These are the persons who are alone responsible, and should nor-mally be responsible for the accuracy of the figures given here, and for seeing that the instructions issued here con-form with statutes and decrees issued by the Soviet insti-tutions concerned.
I therefore refuse to vote on the sub-stance of this telegram.

His father is a millionaire and a Communist (he is in prison in Amer-ica).
He has taken out our first concession, which is very advantageous for us.
He is going to Petrograd to be present at the discharge of the first wheat ship * and to arrange for the receipt of machinery for his concession ((asbestos mines)).
It is my earnest request that you issue orders at once to see that there is no red tape and that reliable comrades should personally keep an eye on the progress and speed of all operations for this concession.
This is of the utmost importance.
Armand Hammer is travelling with the director of his company, Mr.

I, for my part, would consider it necessary to support the petition.
Incidentally, in connection with your letter to me, please let me know whether you are quite satisfied with the work of the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory; also send me, if possible, the briefest comment from Bonch-Bruyevich about the progress of his work in making the megaphones capable of broadcasting to the masses what comes in over the wireless telephone.
This work is of exceptional impor-tance for us because its success, which Bonch-Bruyevich promised long ago, would be of enormous benefit to agitation and propaganda.
It is necessary, therefore, to make some sacrifices to back this work.
In particular, I have heard that in Amer-ica such work has already resulted in practical success.
There should be a check to see whether the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory has at its disposal all the latest American literature on this question.

decisions, I discovered immense disorder.
The card, which is here enclosed, defines the form and order of Comrade Ulrikh’s work.
You will see, however, that this is not being fulfilled; neither you nor Zaks have seen to this, although it is your primary duty to do so.
I have instructed Comrade Ulrikh to fill in the card with the strictest accuracy, severely to the point of pedantism.
I charge you, together with Comrade Zaks, to secure the most precise fulfilment of this; if Comrade Ulrikh fails to learn, she should be replaced, and an absolutely accu-rate worker found.
The enclosed cards show that Comrade Fotieva has also started, like Comrade Ulrikh, to alter the card on her own.
This I absolutely do not allow.
Only deputy chairmen, by their joint signatures, have the right to prescribe or permit any alteration of the card.
Any other alterations should entail dismissal from office.
It is better to verify only a part of the C.

decisions (as marked off by the deputies or business manager), but they should be verified with pedantic accuracy.

) and to communicate their names to the C.
P.
C.
and C.
L.
D.
business manager.
For negligence these persons should be relentlessly punished by arrest or dis-missed by order of the deputies.
For carelessness, a People’s Commissar should be punished by a reprimand, simple or with entry in his Party card.
To watch over this—most strictly—is the duty of the C.
P.
C.
business manager, and I will not hesitate to dismiss him from his post, unless he fulfils this with pedantic precision.
The task is to teach the People’s Commissariats to be accurate, jailing and dismissing the careless workers.
What has been said about the People’s Commissariats applies to all the separate institutions (State Planning Commission, Central Statistical Board, Concessions Com-mittee, People’s Commissariat for Internal Trade, etc.
) and to the gubernia executive committees, regional eco-nomic conferences, etc.
You and Zaks shall have the duty twice a month to write me (briefly, in telegraphic style) about how the accurate verification of execution is organised.
Failure to do so will entail dismissal.
I enclose the cards filled in by Comrade Fotieva (which she has done carelessly and inadmissibly) and the clean cards corrected by me: don’t dare dirty them, don’t dare make any unnecessary entries, don’t dare make the slight-est departures.
Otherwise, I shall sack both the secretaries and all the business managers.
Show this paper to both deputies at once.
Have them sign (before my departure, i.
e.
, within not more than 3 or 4 days) a most precise order on how, in accordance with my instructions, they are to verify execution, fill in the cards, and punish for carelessness.

Throughout the world it is the department stores that beat everyone else.
Yet, in what way are they better than state trade? There is need systematically to go over to bonuses for employees for turnover and profit.
Unless this is done the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade (and all of us) will be a flop.
Frumkin does not think about this, and that is his fault.

We established that the Ukrainian Commis-sariat for Foreign Trade has a special organisation for the sale and export of coal to Italy which has reportedly x) sent out one ship.
That is why we confined ourselves to a decision on selecting the best brands of coal for the needs of export to Italy—for the purpose of winning the Italian market.
As for the question of the two ships itself—we have postponed it until the question of how much coal has already been sent to Italy is cleared up.
xx) Please note that our representatives at Genoa have been confus-ing x xx ) us all the time, making demands which they cancel within a few days.
I shall send a telegram tomorrow asking them to bring up with Moscow only motivated and considered questions and propos-als, as it is quite impossible to do one thing at the request of Litvi-nov and Chicherin only to abandon it on Krasin’s proposal.
Krasin’s telegram shows that he himself is out of touch and does not know that the coal is already on the way and has been partially sold.
The telegram on which you have made an inscription does not even sayto which of the Italian ports the coal is to go, where the buyer is to be found, and who is to be responsible for the sale of coal in Italy.

My opinion on the two Petrograd publications: Novaya Rossiya No.

682 Closed down by the Petrograd comrades.
Perhaps it has been closed down too early? Circulate it to the Politbureau members and discuss more thoroughly.
What is its editor Lezhnev? Is he from Dyen? Could infor-mation about him be collected? Of course, not all the peo-ple working on the magazine are candidates for deporta-tion.
683 The Petrograd magazine Ekonomist, published by the XIth Department of the Russian Technical Society, is anoth-er matter.
684 I think this is clearly a whiteguard centre.
Its No.
3 (only No.
3!!! this nota bene!) carries a list of its members on the cover.
These, I think, are almost all the most legitimate candidates for deportation.
These are all patent counter-revolutionaries, accomplices of the Entente, an organisation of its servitors and spies and corrupters of the student youth.
We should make arrange-ments to have these “military spies” caught and once caught constantly and systematically and deported.
Please show this confidentially, without making any copies, to the Politbureau members, returning it to you and to me, and inform me of their opinion and your conclu-sion.

STALIN Comrade Stalin: I am sending on to you a letter from Comrade Anikst, who attacked me yesterday (18/V).
He is offended, embit-tered, alarmed.
He is nervous, he is sick.
I advised him to complete his treatment and to keep a grip on his nerves.
He seems to be a good worker.
His treatment should becompleted in Germany or in Riga.
(Nothing will come out in Russia.

Comrade Vladimirov: As regards the apparatus, you are being unjustly ag-grieved.

—— As regards catching out “NEPmen” I advise that we give very careful thought (perhaps, assign to this in a highly secret manner Rozengolts and another one or two comrades) about what we should do shortly: either introduce an income tax or a compulsory loan? or: which earlier? Local finances have already yielded considerable data.
They should be systematically collected and processed, winkling out the names and then deciding the matter raised.

If it is true, give every support.
Has Rutgers achieved anything? I doubt it.
If anything has been achieved here, we should award the Order of the Banner of Labour;—send a letter to America (on your behalf or mine);— make the State Bank work out easier loans for such enterprises; and make the People’s Commissariat for Finance or the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture urgently work out easier terms for recruiting more tractors (in the autumn; now, to manage in time).
This appears to be an efficient example; business-like assistance; while we over here have no end of red tape! Instruct secretary or business manager to write me a reply.

ON REJECTING THE AGREEMENT WITH LESLIE URQUHART 12/IX.
Comrade Stalin: Having read Krasin’s agreement with Urquhart, I ex-press my objection to its approval.
While promising earn-ings for us within two or three years, Urquhart is taking our money just now.
This is absolutely inadmissible.
Mikhailov, chairman of the commission, who had made a special on-the-spot study of the Urquhart concession, has proved that it is not we but the foreigners who are guilty of the destruction.
And after this it is we who have to pay!! We shall allegedly obtain relief within X years, but we ourselves have to start paying right away! I propose that this concession be rejected.
This is bondage and plunder.
I remind you of the conclusion of the Mikhailov com-mission.
It was against the concession.
Not a single serious argument has been added.
It should be rejected.
I ask you to communicate this to the Politbureau mem-bers.
With communist greetings, V.
Ulyanov (Lenin) P.
S.
It is a ruse to say that this concession will not be a precedent.
* See also Document 755 of this volume.
—Ed.
It is bound to be and is sure to be a precedent.
That is how it is sure actually to shape out regardless of all the talk and assurances.
And in general, absolutely no account has been taken of everything uncovered by the Mikhailov commission.
There are a number of arguments against such a concession.

Comrade Pyatakov: Here is a rough record of our conversation of yesterday.
1) Comrade Pyatakov is to organise (and tighten up in a military fashion) the State Planning Commission appa-ratus itself (or tbe apparatus of the State Planning Commission itself); mainly through an executive business manager.
He himself should give this matter some 30 mi-nutes a day as a maximum.
2) Comrade Pyatakov’s main task is: a) verification of the state-wide plan, above all the economic plan, chiefly from the standpoint of the apparatus as a whole; b) reduc-tion of the apparatus, including our trusts; c) verification of the proportion between the various sections of the state apparatus; d) work to reduce the cost of the state appara-tus on the lines of an American trust: eliminate all un-productive expenditures.
3) Comrade Pyatakov is to be released from the State * See Document 759 of this volume.

Planning Commission’s current work to a maximum (roughly, an hour a day).

RYKOV 25/IX.
Comrade Rykov: I think it is absolutely necessary to carry out a one-day census of all officials and employees of the city of Moscow.
We had one, but too long ago.
To do this at the minimum expense (only on paper, and even this can be obtained partly from the general stock of the Central Statistical Board), put an obligation on all those who are on the payroll of the Soviet govern-ment and the trusts to submit information on personalcards themselves (in accordance with a short programme which the Central Statistical Board must work out within a week, together with the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, the State Planning Commission, etc.
).
No one is to be paid any salary until this is properly done.
Then we shall get this quickly (fines for delays and un-satisfactory performance).
Our apparatus is such an abomination that it has to be radically repaired.
This cannot be done without a census.
And the Central Statistical Board deserves being taken to task for its academism: there they are sitting and writing their “tomes”, giving not a thought to the vital problems.
Reply or pass the reply on to Comrade Smolyaninov.
Yours, Lenin Mobilisation should be applied, if necessary, but un-der a special law.
All the employees of the Central Statis-tical Board should be mobilised and a certain percentage of the others as well.

KRASIN Comrade Krasin: You have working for you a man called Yermakov (head of the transport-materials department?) with the rights of member of the Collegium.
I saw him two or three times during the Civil War years, carrying out the most difficult, responsible and dangerous assignments.
He is no ordinary man.
It turns out that he is most gravely ill (bleeding from the throat).
He has tried to receive treatment, but has never completed the full course, because the local “boys” have always diverted him to local work.
He has a big family; his salary is 200 million—next to nothing.
This won’t do.
It is our duty to provide treatment for such men and see that it is completed.
He should be sent to Germany for a few months, and his family should be helped.

PYATAKOV ON LESLIE URQUHART’S CONCESSION Comrade Pyatakov: Yesterday you spoke out, like myself, against the Urquhart concession.
That is why I think you are able and will agree to check once again the matter of this concession (especially since our decision of yesterday in essence puts off the question once again).
It is my opinion that the check-up should deal mainly with the question of monopoly; that is the central point of the matter.
Then there is the question of the financial benefits from the concession.
1) A map of the concession should be obtained at the Mining Council—I.
K.
Mikhailov (chairman of the commis-sion which went to the place) says that he gave them the map.
2) There is need to compile a table: a list of the main products; percentage of their production at our other plants (copper, zinc, and other products); where else they are produced, whether very far from the centre or nearer, etc.
3) Conclusion: in what branch, for what product Urquhart is to get a monopoly, its significance.
4) The chief of all the questions—Ekibastuz and its importance for the Urals.
I was very surprised at Bogdanov’s slip: “Kuzbas is nearer” (it is much farther), while Comrade Krzhizhanov-sky said that I was adhering to Mendeleyev’s obsolete and rejected views.
What is there to argue about when Ekibas-tuz has a branch-line running to the Irtysh, and provides much shorter and cheaper water transport to the Urals? What is the essence here? If Kuzbas is much more expensive and distant (no water transport), we have no right to let Urquhart have the whole of Ekibastuz; he is welcome to take one-half.
Please show this letter only to Krzhizhanovsky; do not assign this check-up to anyone else; do it yourself (of course, any official will let you have all the statistical figures about the volume and place of extraction of zinc, copper, etc.
, without knowing what they are for); write me whether you undertake to do this, and how soon you expect to finish it.

ON AN AGREEMENT WITH A CONSORTIUM OF GERMAN FIRMS 721 Comrade STALIN for the POLITBUREAU Copy to Comrade KAMENEV I have given a careful reading to the agreement with Otto Wolff.
I find that Comrade Kamenev’s objections arebased entirely on a misunderstanding, and I believe the question should be brought up for decision by the Polit-bureau not later than tomorrow, because the difference between Kamenev and myself calls for an authoritative and final decision.
Kamenev writes in his note that “we are under an obli-gation to Wolff to buy his goods”.
This is a complete mis-understanding.
When reading the agreement, I saw in several clauses that we have the right to check the list of goods given us by Wolff.
We do not undertake the slightest obligation to buy Wolff’s goods.
If Wolff fails to draw up a list of goods which we agree to buy, then the agree-ment extends only to that part of Wolff’s goods which we have agreed to buy.
I clarified this matter in detail today both with Lezhava and Frumkin, and both have confirmed that not the slightest obligation in any sense falls on us to buy Wolff’s goods.
A similar misunderstanding on Comrade Kamenev’s part explains his allegation that Lezhava has “enhanced” his doubt.
Actually there is quite a different explanation to Stomonyakov’s proposal, which is formulated on page 2 of Protocol No.
62, and which was unanimously accepted by all our economic executives.
The proposal is that, in the interests of our reviving industry, Wolff should develop to the utmost the delivery to us of machine-tools and other implements necessary, for example, for the electric trust.
Wolff may accept this because such an order will also give him earnings, and it happens that the German metal industry is in need of orders in general.
We are abso-lutely in need of machine-tools and machinery for the elec-tric trust, let us say, because this industry of ours is be-ginning to revive, and it is of extreme importance for us to develop this industry here, by finally reinforcing it with German means of production.
Consequently, the amendment tabled by Lezhava flows from the correctly understood economic interests of Rus-sia, which now needs protectionism, especially for her whole light industry, because then it will be easier for us to rehabilitate this industry, thereby ensuring the interests of our proletariat.
Lezhava’s amendment has nothing in common with free trade of any sort or even with the open-ing of frontiers, assuming the retention of customs tariffs.
At the end of his note, Comrade Kamenev writes: “The result: for a deferment of our payments to Wolff for a year, for unknown goods, we are now giving him a monopoly right to purchase and export raw materials.
That is cheap.
” This is total misunderstanding.
It is impossible to imag-ine a more advantageous agreement than the one we are concluding with Wolff.
We pay him 10 per cent a year, whereas even Britain now pays 7 per cent, and the German Government pays 12 per cent.
That’s the first thing.
The second is that we are not buying from him any unknown goods, but only those we have checked by list and permit-ted for import.
The third fact is that we are giving him a monopoly right to buy and export for a sharing of the profits which can have nothing to do with any kind of customs tariffs.
Namely: first, we receive a 10 per cent dividend, second, we receive a 10 per cent profit, like Wolff, and third, if the profit is in excess of 40 per cent, we receive 75 per cent of the rest, whereas the consortium receives only 25 per cent.
I think the agreement with Wolff is a typical agreement with German capitalist enterprises.
Such an agreement is immense]y advantageous to us if only because we receive a half share of the profits which might go up to hundreds of per cent.
In the process, the interests of our reviving industry and consequently of our industrial enterprises are fully protected.
There is not a trace of the devastating consequences which would flow for us even from a conditional, even from a temporary opening of the frontiers.
That is why I absolutely insist on approval of the agreement with Wolff, and in view of the extreme urgency of the matter I request that this question should be raised in the Politbureau tomorrow, and enclose herewith the agreement with Wolff and Comrade Kamenev’s note.

, Vol.
4 5 Printed from a typewritten copy with Lenin’s corrections and signature776 TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PERM GUBERNIA EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE October 20, 1922.
The American tractor team, led by Comrade Harold Ware, which is working in Okhansk Uyezd, on the territory of Perm Gubernia, has achieved considerable results, although it has been working only a short time.
Altogether, up to 1,500 dessiatines has been ploughed up, of which almost 1,000 dessiatines has been sown to winter grain crops.
But for the usual drawbacks in our practice, the said group would have undoubtedly succeeded in achieving even greater results.
Your report, however, mentions the shortage of gasoline and lubricating oil, and the shortage of building workers, but says nothing about what the Gubernia Executive Com-mittee has done to straighten things out.
It is absolutely intolerable that such a useful undertak-ing does not meet with every possible support, especially on the part of local organisations, which are in a better position to analyse any obstacles and help to remove them.
Please give the maximum support to this group, and, in particular, help implement their proposals for the efficient use of tractors, supply of gasoline, establishment of a repair shop, housing construction, etc.
The assistance being extended to us by the American agricultural groups is most desirable and timely.
Our task in all this is mainly to help them carry out their ideas with the least possible delay.
Please inform me of the results of your measures through Comrade Smolyaninov, and also of any specially impor-tant current needs which you are unable to meet yourself.

1922 A number of newspaper articles have noted the absolute-ly extraordinary success scored by some American agri-cultural communes and teams who had brought their tractors along with them.
It has been established in a special check-up that excellent work has been done by thetractor team led by Harold Ware in the Toikino State Farm, Perm Gubernia.
Besides, the Industrial Immigration Department of the Supreme Economic Council is in pos-session of similar information concerning the work of agri-cultural communes in Kirsanov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia, and in the village of Migayevo, Tiraspol Uyezd, Odessa Gubernia.
The American Society for Technical Aid to Russia is now organising nearly 200 artels with 800-1,000 tractors for dispatch to Russia.
If this goes through, we shall have at least one model farm with American machinery in each uyezd, which I believe to be of great importance.
With the object of encouraging this undertaking, I have written letters of thanks to the American Society of Friends of Soviet Russia and the American Society for Tech-nical Aid to Soviet Russia, telling them that no type of aid is as important to us or as timely as that which they are extending to our agriculture.
* In these letters I told them that I was sending a recommendation to the Presid-ium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee that they should declare the Perm and other leading farms model ones and give them special and extraordinary as-sistance, both in respect of building operations, and in the supply of gasoline, metal, and other material necessary for the extension of operations and the starting of repair shops.
Please consider this question and grant my request.

BRYUKHANOV Comrade Bryukhanov People’s Commissariat for Food I have been informed that, because of the rainy summer, great quantities of grain are being delivered to the grain-collecting stations in a moist state.
It is feared that it will easily heat up and lose its economic value.
Please let me know whether this is true, and whether the necessary measures have been taken to safeguard the collected grain, and also who is personally in charge of this on the all-Russia scale.
Gleb Maximilianovich informs me that a great threat to the tax in kind lies in the delayed delivery of consider-able quantities of food, reaching 10,000 carloads at the points of destination—Moscow, Petrograd, Samara, Ry-binsk, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and others, which is due to a shortage of storage space at the points of destination and general delays in discharging.
It looks as though no favourable results have yet been achieved by re-routing freight from one point to another, because even after re-routing to other points, the freight cars are kept under discharge for weeks, waiting for sacking and storage space.
An especially dangerous moment now seems to be coming up because the warehouses are full up.
Please let me know the present state of the unloadingof grain, and the measures being taken by the People’s Commissariat for Food to accelerate it.

I feel that the draft gives virtually nothing new in comparison with the resolution of the Second Congress of the Comintern on the agrarian question.
I very much fear that some formulations, diverging, perhaps even accidentally, from the Second Congress resolution, may causemisunderstanding and breed artificial talk about a discrep-ancy between this draft and the Second Congress resolu-tion.
There also seems to be a distinct element which weak-ens what was said there about supporting the peasant movement, and which is capable of producing some dis-sent between the needy peasantry and the rural proletariat.
I am unable to go into this question in greater detail and make a sentence-by-sentence collation between Varga’s draft resolution which you have sent in and the Second Congress resolution.
I consider it necessary to warn that we should not let ourselves accumulate numerous resolu-tions on one and the same question which are capable of producing misunderstanding and confusion.
As a minimum, I would propose: 1) To collate the new resolution with the Second Congress resolution sentence by sentence.
2) To give the new resolution the character of something like a partial commentary.
I personally feel that the new resolution is of very doubtful value.

Much young fish of the sturgeon species, including the almost extinct white sturgeon, has also appeared.
But on the one hand, there has been started at once unchecked and unrestricted plun-derous catching of young sturgeon, which could quickly cancel out the favourable effect of the war.
On the other hand, something inconceivable has allegedly been happen-ing, and perhaps is still happening, in the lower reaches of the Don.
As an example I have been told that even the water guards of the Don Food Committee have engaged in plunderous fishing in the restricted zone, with a sort of charge allegedly being levied for permission to catch fish in the restricted area—between 400 and 500 million rubles for one net casting.
The chief of the water guard service of the Don Food Committee has been removed from his post for plunderousfishing in the lower reaches of the Don.
This gentleman has merely been removed from his post.
It is necessary to find out where he is and to make a more serious check up on whether he has been sufficiently punished.
Please appoint an inquiry into both cases and inform me through Comrade Gorbunov of the results in a short note.
These people should not just be given a scare, but should also be brought to book and taken to task for these scandalous practices.

Let the example of the Russian workers and peasants holding their fate in their own hands serve as an encouragement to the American proletariat and farmers.
In spite of the terrible consequence of the war destruction we are going ahead, though not possessing to the extent of one tenth the tremendous resources for the economic building of a new life that have been at the disposal of the American people, for many years.

STALIN Comrade Stalin Comrade Stalin: I question the legality of yesterday’s decision about Rozhkov, because: first, this decision, contrary to custom and rules, had not been entered on the agenda before 12.
00; second, the documents were not communicated to C.
C.
members beforehand; third, there was no ground for haste after a twofold discussion of the question, especially since I was present at the first part of the sitting, and the question came up just when I had to leave.
That is why I insist on referring the matter to the plenum, especially because only a week remains before it meets.
747 On the question of Lozovsky, I propose that the time which has been made available should go into a more thorough search for the necessary candidates.
748We, as a Party, have already devoted an unconscionable amount of energy to the Comintern, and, consequently, to the Profintern as well.
If Lozovsky has proved to be independently not quite satisfactory, there is need to re-cruit fresh forces either from among the foreigners, or among workers who would in no case be used otherwise, i.
e.
, either for organisational, or practical, or administra-tive work.
That is why it is quite impossible to take Kal-nin who, I have heard, has started rather important and, unless I am mistaken, rather successful work in Donbas.
On no account either should there simply be an appoint-ment of Tomsky, because he is swamped with work at the All-Russia Central T.
U.
C.
, which is rendered extremely difficult by the shortage of men.
If necessary, I propose the appointment of Tomsky and Rudzutak to have them devote to this new duty not more than 30 minutes a day, with the compulsory engagement of two or more secre-taries who know foreign languages and who are capable of keeping Tomsky and Rudzutak informed in every detail.
I propose that an assignment to find such secretaries be given to the Orgbureau or the Secretariat, provided they are not removed from any post which our Party needs.
I draw attention to the fact that if men like Rothstein are not used, this is a clear indication of crying anarchy in the administrative arrangements of the Profintern and the Comintern, because, at any rate, such men have proved by their long work that they are quite suitable for literary activity, for example, in the old Neue Zeit 749 ; there is no doubt that given the necessary secretarial assist-ance these men will be of exceptional benefit, and the required secretaries can and must be recruited not from among Russians but foreigners.
It is high time that an end should be put to the drawing of forces from our Party for the benefit of the Comintern and the Profintern.
I propose that a relevant proposal should be sent to the C.
C.
Secretariat or the Orgbureau.

Unfortunately, because of my illness, * I have not been able to follow your activities since the Third Congress of the Communist International.
There is now the most delicate task to cope with.
The congress has decided upon the merger and it should be promoted to the best of one’s abilities.
751 I am sure that you will use all your authority and the enthusiasm of the old devoted revolutionary to achieve the great purpose which we set ourselves, that of establishing a solid and sincere union of all true revolu-tionaries.
I count on you especially in case Serrati may create obstacles, even though against his will: the distrust from the past is so gleat that he must not only be most loyal (this goes without saying), but must prove this in every way.
What is more, he must especially find all possible methods (he is rather adroit and flexible in this) to avoid giving any pretext for mistrust on the part of the Commu-nists.
Unfortunately, my illness has prevented me from saying this personally to Serrati.

755 At any rate, it is my request that at the forthcoming plenum you should undertake the defence of our common standpoint on the unquestionable need to maintain and consolidate the foreign trade monopoly.
Since the preced-ing plenum passed a decision in this respect which runs entirely counter to the foreign trade monopoly, and since there can be no concessions on this matter, I believe, as I say in my letter to Frumkin and Stomonyakov, * that in the event of our defeat on this question we must refer the question to a Party Congress.
This will require a brief exposition of our differences before the Party group of the * The letter has not been found.

forthcoming Congress of Soviets.
7 5 6 If I have time, I shall write this, and I would be very glad if you did the same.
Hesitation on this question is doing us unprecedented harm, and the negative arguments boil down entirely to accusations of shortcomings in the apparatus.
But our ap-paratus is everywhere imperfect, and to abandon the monopoly because of an imperfect apparatus would be throwing out the baby with the bath water.

I am now through with putting my business in order, and am in a position to leave without worry.

There is only one thing that is worrying me extremely—it is that I am unable to speak at the Congress of Soviets.

there is any chance at all of my doing so.
I would regard my missing it as a great inconvenience, to put it no strong-er.
I have had the outline of my speech written several days ago.
7 6 0 I propose, therefore, without suspending pre-parations by some other speaker in my place, to keep open until Wednesday the possibility that I will perhaps per-sonally make a speech, much shorter than the usual one, say, lasting 45 minutes.
Such a speech would in no way prevent a substitute (whomsoever you would authorise for that purpose) from making a speech, but I think it would be useful both in the political and in the personal sense, because it would remove any cause for great agitation.
Please have this in mind, and if the opening of the congress should be further delayed, inform me in good time through my secretary.

1922 I am resolutely opposed to any delay on the question of the foreign trade monopoly.
If the idea should arise, for whatever reason (including the proposition that my participation in the question is desirable), to postpone it until the next plenum, I should most resolutely object to this, because I am sure that Trotsky will be able to stand up for my views just as well as I myself.
That is the first thing.
The second is that your statement and Zinoviev’s and, according to rumour, Kamenev’s as well, confirm that some members of the C.
C.
have already altered their earlier opinion; third, and most important: any further hesitation on this highly important question is absolutely intolerable and will tend to frustrate any work.

TROTSKY Comrade Trotsky: I consider that we have quite reached agreement.
I ask you to declare our solidarity at the plenum.
I hope that our decision will be passed, because some of those who had voted against it in October have now partially or al-together switched to our side.
* If for some reason our decision should not be passed, we shall apply to the group of the Congress of Soviets, and declare that we are referring the question to the Party congress.
In that case, inform me and I shall send in my state-ment.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
If this question should be removed from the pres-ent plenum (which I do not expect, and against which you should, of course, protest as strongly as you can on our common behalf), I think that we should apply to the group of the Congress of Soviets anyway, and demand that the question be referred to the Party congress, because any further hesitation is absolutely intolerable.
You can keep all the material I have sent you until after the plenum.

there are any fears that I am being worried by this ques-tion and that it could even have an effect on my health, I think that this is absolutely wrong, because I am infinite-ly more worried by the delay which makes our policy on one of the most basic questions quite unstable.
That is why I call your attention to the enclosed letter and ask you to support an immediate discussion of this question.
I am sure that if we are threatened with the danger of fail-ure, it would be much better to fail before the Party con-gress, and at once to apply to the group of the congress, than to fail after the congress.
Perhaps, an acceptable compromise is that we pass a decision just now confirming the monopoly, and still bring up the question at the Party congress, making an arrangement about this right away.
I do not believe that we could accept any other compro-mise either in our own interests or the interests of the cause.

A.
Baryshnikov’s inven-tion was not being tested fast enough and asked Lenin to issue instructions to have it applied in production as soon as possible.
On November 19, 1920, Lenin received a reply to his inquiry (see next document) which stated that the Inventions Committee of the Scientific and Technical Department of the Supreme Econom-ic Council had examined Baryshnikov’s application submitted to the Committee on September 15, and had on September 30 issued to him a claim certificate.
The Committee said Baryshni-kov’s invention differed little from earlier ones, while the quality of the leather was to be ascertained by means of tests; the initial tests carried out by the Central Administration of the Leather Industry (Glavkozha) had been unfavourable, and Baryshnikov was working to improve his invention.
The final conclusion would be drawn as a result of further tests.

Krupskaya proposed the following fundamental addition to the letter: “The Proletcult emerged before the October Revo-lution.
It was proclaimed an ‘independent’ workers’ organisa-tion, unconnected with the Ministry of Public Education under Kerensky.
The October Revolution changed the prospect.
The Proletcults continued to remain ‘independent’, but now they were ‘independent’ of the Soviet power.
” The following was also accepted in her wording: “Instead of helping proletarian youth to engage in serious study and making its communist approach to all the aspects of life and art more profound, artists and philosophers essentially remote from and hostile to commu-nism, but proclaiming themselves to be truly proletarian, hampered the workers.

On November 26, 1920, Kamensky sent Lenin a letter, inform-ing him that the State Publishers were delaying the issue of a prepared collection of Soviet government decisions on the nation-al question over a period of three years, and requested Lenin’s personal intervention.
The note published here was written by Lenin on Kamensky’s letter.

61 27On December 13, 1920, Lenin received S.
M.
Ter-Gabrielyan, who had been sent to Moscow by the Revolutionary Committee of Armenia to report to Lenin on the political and economic situation in Armenia.
As a result of the reckless policy of the Dashnaks, who had started a war against Turkey in late September 1920—with the approval of the Entente—the Turkish army occupied the towns of Sarykamysh, Kars, Alexandropol and others.
On the occupied territory, the Turkish troops massacred great numbers of Arme-nians.
Many Armenians died from starvation and epidemics, and thousands of families fled from their homes, seeking refuge in other parts of Armenia.
The Dashnak government of Armenia rejected the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
’s mediation and preferred to sign the enslaving Alexandropol Treaty on December 2, 1920, under which Armenia was declared a Turkish protectorate.
But the treaty did not enter into force, because the Dashnak government was overthrown on November 29, 1920, and the Soviet power was proclaimed in Armenia.
On March 16, 1921, the R.
S.

37At the invitation of peasants from the village of Modenovo, Bogorodsk Volost, Vereya Uyezd, Moscow Gubernia, Lenin gave a report on the current situation at a meeting of the inhabitants of the villages of Modenovo, Shalikovo and others, on December 15, 1920.
At their request, Lenin signed a record of the minutes.
When the peasants complained about their excessive quotas in the delivery of surplus corn and hay, Lenin said that he was unable to decide the matter on the spot and asked them to send a representative to Moscow.
In fulfilment of an assignment from Lenin, N.
P.
Gorbunov got the actual condition of the peasants in the village of Mode-novo thoroughly verified, and on March 5, 1921, their deliveries were cancelled.
Before this decision had been taken, a general meeting of Modenovo peasants on January 29, 1921, discussed the matter of surplus deliveries and decided that the quotas could not be met in full.
They added: “Realising the critical state of the country, however, we have decided to help with food and fodder, reducing our own stocks to the bare minimum.
In additionto our earlier fulfilled quotas, we have decided to add 3 poods of rye, 10 poods of oats, 31 poods of potatoes and 24 poods of hay” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

After “peaceful mediation” by the British command, which pursued its own colonialist aims, military operations were stopped, the northern part of Borchalo Uyezd going to Georgia, the southern, to Armenia, and the central—Lori district—was declared a neu-tral zone with a mixed Georgian-Armenian local administration subordinate to the Entente military command.
In November 1920, in view of the war between Dashnak Armenia and Turkey, the neutral zone was occupied, with the Entente’s consent, by the troops of Menshevik Georgia.
The working population of the neutral zone, which was being subjected to savage plunder and violence, staged an armed uprising under the leadership of the Communists against the oppressors on the night of February 11, 1921.

But in a letter to Lenin on March 5, 1921 (which Lenin passed to Goikhbarg the same day), Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs L.
M.
Kara-khan said that the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs was also working on the question of the losses and requested that the material should be handed over to a commission of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

11 on January 8, 1921.
The letter urged all workers’, trade union and socialist organisations in Germany to join efforts in fightingthe growing reaction and the capitalist offensive against the work-ing people’s vital rights.
Although the workers came out in favour of the united prole-tarian front, the proposal for joint action with the Communists was rejected by the Right-wing leadership of the organisations to which the “Open Letter” was addressed.
p.
124 116A reference to armed action by the proletariat of Germany in March 1921.
The Left-wing majority of the C.
C.
of the United Communist Party of Germany, proceeding from the so-called “theory of the offensive”, whose supporters held that offensive tactics were the only correct ones in any situation, regardless of the concrete po-litical conditions, pushed the workers towards a premature upris-ing.
Making use of this, the German bourgeoisie provoked armed action at an unfavourable moment.
An uprising broke out in several areas of Central Germany in March 1921.
Despite the workers’ heroic action, the uprising was put down, because the majority of the working class had not been prepared for the action and had not taken part in the fighting.

The congress was held at Livorno from January 15 to 21, 1921, and marked a split in the Party.
Upon his return to Germany Levi came out in defence of the Italian Centrists headed by Giacinto Serrati.
On February 24, 1921, after the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of Germany adopted a resolution against Serrati and his supporters, and welcomed the establishment of the Communist Party of Italy, five members of the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of Ger-many (Otto Braß, Ernst Däumig, A.
Hoffmann, Paul Levi, and Clara Zetkin) withdrew from the C.
C.
, saying that they disagreed with the Central Committee.
p.
124 119On March 29, 1921, Paul Levi wrote Lenin a letter to which the present document is a reply.
Levi condemned the March action and declared that he was withdrawing from the Party leader-ship and would write a pamphlet setting out his views.
In early April 1921, Levi issued a pamphlet entitled Unser Weg.
Wider den Putschismus (“Our Way.
Against Putschism”), in which he called the struggle of hundreds of thousands of Ger-man proletarians a “Bakuninist putsch”.
Levi urged the workers to condemn the Communists, alleging that they were responsible for the defeat of the uprising.
On April 15, 1921, the Central Com-mittee of the U.
C.
P.
G.
expelled Levi from the Party for a gross breach of the Party discipline and the harm done to the Party by the publication of his pamphlet, and demanded that he giveup his parliamentary seat.
On April 29, the Comintern Executive Committee endorsed the decision of the U.
C.
P.
G.
Central Com-mittee expelling Levi from the Party.
The question of the tactical differences which arose in connection with the March action was referred to the Third Congress of the Comintern, which confirmed Levi s expulsion from the Party.
Subsequently Levi went over entirely to Social-Democratic positions and carried on a fight against the Communist International.

They criticised the old faculty opposing any renovation of the higher schools, and made their own proposals to amend the draft statute of institutions of higher learning adopted by the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Education.
On April 20, 1921, the Politbureau asked the People’s Com-missariat for Education to refrain from publishing the statute for the time being, for the purpose of elaborating and discussing the question additionally.

143 143An apparent reference to N.
K.
Klyshko’s telegram of May 9, 1921.
Replying to the telegram from Lenin and Krasin of May 7 (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
52, Supple-ments, Document 33), Klyshko informed them about the purchase in America of 20,000 poods of wheat flour, with delivery at Revel by May 15, and 200,000 with delivery at Petrograd by mid-June, and about delivery at Revel of 125,000 poods by the end of April.
(“Where are these 1 5 , 0 0 0 ? How have they been distributed?”, Lenin wrote over this report.
) Klyshko also promised to supply additional information about the possibility of further grain purchases, requested the sending of the warrant and the currency, and asked: “Is it all right, in order to speed up and reduce the cost, to send in up to 25 per cent of maize and bean flour as an admixture to the wheat flour?” “Of course!” replied Lenin, under-scoring the word “admixture” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Another of Lenin’s notes to Frunze appears to refer to this period:.
“What have you managed to do about the salt? Who is responsible for the salt? Lenin” (Lenin Miscellany XXXIV, p.
414): At the Central Party Archives there is also a memo sent in by Frunze to the C.

M.
Yurovsky, told Lenin about cases of theft of valuables at Gokhran.
Making a note of this, Lenin, the same day, instructed a member of the All-Russia Cheka Collegium, G.
I.
Bokii, to carry out a strict inquiry.
In a telephone message on May 23 (in reply to which the pres-ent letter was written), Bokii alleged that Yurovsky’s informa-tion was highly exaggerated and that measures were being taken together with the All-Russia Cheka to bring the stealing at Gokhran down to a minimum.
Lenin’s remark on the telephone message says: “Give me a reminder.
” Lenin subsequently returned to the matter repeatedly (see this volume, Documents 180, 205, 216 and 221, and Lenin Miscellany p.
153 XXXVI, pp.
288, 298, 370, 403-05).
156On May 28, 1921, G.
I.
Bokii submitted to Lenin a detailed report about the state of affairs at Gokhran—the personnel, struc-ture, cases of stealing and a list of court cases at Gokhran.
The report proposed some measures to improve the work and prevent stealing.
On May 29, Lenin sent this report, together with his covering letter, to Deputy People’s Commissar for Finance, A.
O.
Alsky (see this volume, Document 180).
p.
154 157This refers to a resolution on the new rating policy adopted on May 11, 1921, by the Seventh Skopin (Ryazan Gubernia) Uyezd Trade Union Conference.
It stated that the inefficient distribution of manpower and the low labour productivity were one of the main reasons hamper-ing economic rehabilitation in Skopin Uyezd.
A switch to col-lective supply of workers and employees was proposed as one of the measures to remove these shortcomings.
The conference delegates were instructed to stand up for the propositions set out in the resolution at the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions.

At the same time, Lenin wrote the following note: “1) In the recent period warrants have been issued for ‘arrest at discretion’.
2) Personal warrants are desirable.
” On June 3, the Chairman of the Petrograd Gubernia Cheka informed I.
S.
Unschlicht that all the persons mentioned in Lenin’s telegram had been released, the arrests in Petrograd were carried out among former members of the Cadet Party, because some of them had taken part in a plot uncovered in Petrograd; persons without compromising material were released.

He argued that the Azerbaijan Oil Committee did not have a smoothly run-ning trade apparatus and referred to the prepared agreement on merging the foreign trade of the three Transcaucasian republics.
Lezhava also mentioned the agreement concluded on April 22, at Rostov-on-Don, on the basis of the C.

Lenin asked Kuusinen to give the report on this question at the Third Congress of the Comintern and made a number of remarks for the theses (see present edition, Vol.

316-18).
On the strength of this, Kuusinen reworked his theses and, on June 17, sent them to Lenin again (without paragraphs 25-29, relating to the Party press); on June 21, he sent in the remaining paragraphs.
Lenin must have read this variant of the theses.
On June 27, Kuusinen sent to Lenin a third variant of the theses.
Wilhelm Koenen, a German Communist, also took part in elabor-ating the theses.
On July 9, Lenin approved the theses and made his final remarks and additions to them (ibid.

A draft concession agreement was worked out in the course of the talks.
But in October 1921, Urquhart broke off the talks and joined the anti-Soviet campaign, in the hope of pressuring and blackmailing the Soviet Government into making serious concessions.
The talks with Urquhart were resumed in 1922.

D.
Kaisarov said that a spe-cial scientific commission for compiling a geographical atlas un-dertook to elaborate the questions outlined in Lenin’s letter to M.
P.
Pavlovich (see present edition, Vol.
35, Document 283), and asked that two of its members should be sent to Berlin to acquire new material on the West European economy, noting that it was desirable to enlist Moscow specialists in compiling the atlas.
The letter said that the commission’s programme and calendar plan of work would be sent to Lenin shortly.
On this letter Lenin made his remarks and underlinings and wrote a number of instructions to Lydia Fotieva (see this vol-ume, Document 140, and Lenin Miscellany XX, pp.
321-22).
p.
194 215This was written in connection with a resolution sent to Lenin by a general meeting of workers of the Moscow Garment Factory No.
36 named after the Third International (émigrés from America).
They wrote that for a month they had been unable to start their factory equipped with the latest machines and devices which they had brought along from America, and asked Lenin to help them to obtain the materials necessary to complete the equipment of the factory and the repair of the premises, and also to obtain housing.
On June 27, 1921, Lenin signed letters to L.
K.
Martens and V.
T.
Likhachov, Chairman of the Moscow Gubernia Economic Council, ordering them to remove all red tape in this matter and to help the émigré workers to start the factory as soon as pos-sible (see Lenin Miscellany XX, p.
201).

On the envelope Lenin wrote this assignment to his secretary dated June 27, 1921: “Urgent.
Send them a telegram of thanks and approval.
Give me the draft” (Lenin Miscellany XX, p.
117).
The draft of the reply telegram was written by the C.

195 217In the spring of 1921, a group of American garment workers col-lected money, bought industrial equipment and left for theSoviet Republic.
They were given the opportunity to organise their garment factory No.
36 in Moscow, which was housed in a four-storeyed building, made available on Lenin’s personal in-structions.
On June 16, 1921, the American workers wrote Lenin a collec-tive letter asking him to help them to complete the building of the factory.
Lenin took the most active part in preparations to start the factory (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
53, Supplement, Documents 2 and 3).

p.
197 219In the first part of the letter Lenin made remarks on the first variant of G.
M.
Krzhizhanovsky’s article “To Our Critics”, written in reply to Y.
Larin’s article in Pravda on June 9, 1921, which was entitled “The Mysteries of Soviet Industry”, and which criticised the work of the State Planning Commission (Gosplan).
Krzhizhanovsky wrote to Lenin: “On the spur of the moment, I sketched out an article ‘To Our Critics’, but then found it too flippant and decided to shelve it.
If you have a moment to spare for light reading, run your eye over it.

Krzhizhanovsky subsequently rewrote his article (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
53, Document 298).
The second part of the letter (from the words: “But for a re-port in the C.
L.

administrations, while the latter wanted to retain its own control over it.
On July 7, 1921, a commission of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) Central Com-mittee, set up to settle the conflict, decided that the Administra-tion was to be left under the People’s Commissariat for Food, and ordered the heads of the two establishments to work in close contact and maintain normal relations.
Lenin wanted the conflict settled as soon as possible, because friction at the centre had a negative effect on work all down the line.

N.
A.
Semashko objected to the establishment of the committee, saying that the Mensheviks and the S.
R.

To prevent this, the Politbureau approved a plan to set up a communist group in the Committee and decided to bring into its Presidium only a limited number of bourgeois “public figures”.
p.
208232In a talk with A.
A.
Korostelev, member of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, in early July 1921, Lenin proposed that a Commission for Assist-ing the Economic Bodies should be set up under this People’s Commissariat.
Korostelev was to report on the matter to the Pre-sidium of the Moscow Soviet.
However, the report was not heard at the scheduled time because of the simultaneous opening of the Third Gubernia Congress of Soviets, and was given to the new executive committee of the Moscow Soviet on July 15, 1921.
Attaching great importance to the work of the Commission, Lenin insisted on having regular progress reports (see present edi-tion, Vol.
35, Document 291; Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
53, Document 133).

Similar societies were set up elsewhere in the U.
S.
A.
and Canada.
The aim of the Society was to promote the rehabilitation of the Soviet economy by sending skilled workers and technicians.
The first congress of the societies for technical aid to Soviet Russia was held in New York from July 2 to 4, 1921; it united local societies in several American and Canadian cities into a single Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia.
From the end of 1921 to October 1922, the Society sent to Soviet Russia seven agricultural, two construction and one mining communes and a number of groups which brought with them equipment, seeds andfoodstuffs worth nearly $500,000.
The Society was extending its activity, and by 1923 it had more than 75 branches with over 20,000 members.
Its second congress in June 1923 adopted a de-cision to intensify its work of organising and sending in communes and preparatory groups of skilled workers to Russia.
The Society continued its active economic aid until 1925.
Lenin regarded this activity as a striking expression of prole-tarian internationalism and fraternal solidarity of the working people.

The question of sending this telegram was discussed at a conference of representatives of the Supreme Eco-nomic Council, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and the People’s Commissariat for Labour on August 6, 1921.
Because the votes were split, a vote was taken, on Lenin’s pro-posal, among the members of the C.
P.
C.

The following text was added to the telegram on Lenin’s pro-posal: “One should not forget about the difficulties existing in Russia, which have to be overcome, food supply difficulties and others.
The people coming to Russia must be prepared for this.
It is necessary to be guided by the instructions of the industrial emigration department under the S.

P.
(B.
) Central Committee, on im-plementing the New Economic Policy in Turkestan.
Tomsky in-sisted on introducing the tax in kind and believed it was impos-sible to combine the New Economic Policy with the establish-ment in Turkestan of Committees of Poor Peasants and their sharing out of the property, cattle and stock requisitioned from the kulaks.
Safarov, for his part, insisted that the tax in kind and free exchange were not quite applicable to Turkestan conditions, and laid emphasis on organising unions of the poor and the class stratification of the local population.

269 291Written by Lenin in reply to the thesis on the national liberation movement in India sent to him by the progressive Indian politi-cal leader Bhupendra Nath Datta, who later wrote that Lenin’s letter “came as a revelation to the writer.
That the ‘peasant move-ment’ is of importance for the movement for national freedom has never struck a national-revolutionary.
Sentimentalism is the backbone of nationalism.
The middle class considers itself to be the representative of the nation and sees every movement in that perspective.
Hence, the instruction of Lenin not to discuss the social classes but to get interested in peasant movement set the writer athinking.
It changed his Anschauung regarding the means and methods of Indian fight for freedom” (Bhupendranath Datta, Dialectics of Land-Economics of India, Calcutta, p.
III).
In his letter to Datta, Lenin mentioned his theses on the nation-al and colonial questions for the Second Congress of the Commu-nist International (see present edition, Vol.

He proposed that Gosplan’s role should be confined “only to a general co-ordination of plans submitted by the departments; Gosplan is not to work out any plans on its own, everything being done in the planning commissions of the Com-missariats” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Osinsky was right “in the sense that Gosplan’s work should have a follow-up character.
But it is wrong to interpret this as meaning that the people at Gosplan should in some way engage in ‘summarising’, without having special sections which make use of some of the departmental specialists.
I have already raised with all the sec-tions the question of transforming and delimiting the work of primary planning organs and our own work” (ibid.

He often used to quote to me that part of your report on the agrarian question at the Stockholm Congress, in which you pointed out that a social revolution in the West was the only guarantee against any re-storation after the victory of the revolution in Russia.
Our state of isolation, the discrepancy between our political strength and the economic foundation, and a number of other questions to which he has not yet found an answer, prevent him from joining the R.

The conference recommended that the governments should ex-tend credits to Soviet Russia to combat the famine only if she rec-ognised the debts of the old governments and allowed a commission to control the distribution of food.

Kur-sky, on November 14, 1921, sent Lenin a report from the invest-igation department of the People’s Commissariat for Justice over the first half-year of 1921 on 18 cases involving red tape.
Kursky wrote that most of these cases ended with the imposition of dis-ciplinary penalties, a part of them were wound up and “cases could be referred to the courts (Revolutionary Tribunal and the People’s Courts) only by way of exception”.
Reporting the preparation of exemplary trials, he said they were now considering the renewal of the panels of the people’s judges in Moscow (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

circular.
§ 4 put the duty on the judicial authorities to release Commu-nists up for trial under the personal warranty of individuals delegated by Party Committees.
§ 5 put the duty on the Party Committee to study the case within three days and to have an opinion on the substance of the case, so that the committee’s decision would be a Party directive for the court and would pre-determine the judicial decision.

Pointing to the positive results of this pol-icy in respect of Afghanistan, Mongolia and Persia, Chicherin suggested the same policy in respect of Turkey.

Gosplan’s conclusion said that there were not enough data to decide on the urgency of the project and that its work was not covered by the extraction of peat in the Teikovo bog, where the station was to be sited.
In view of this, Gosplan asked the Central Board for the Peat Industry (Tsutorf) to take urgent steps to intensify the extraction of peat, and the Ivanovo-Voznesensk economic conference to work out, in order to set the exact date for commissioning the electric-power station, a scheme for developing and restructuring industry and other branches of the economy from the standpoint of the requirements in electric power and fuel.

, and other material, Kamenev wrote: “Have a look at this.
This is the max-imum Dzerzhinsky will agree to, and that which Kursky is, of course, satisfied with.
I insist on this maximum: 1.
Unburden the Cheka, leaving political crimes, espionage, banditism and the protection of railways and warehouses in its charge.
Not more.
The rest—to the People’s Commissariat for Justice.
2.
The Cheka’s investigation apparatus to be merged with the People’s Commissariat for Justice, handing it over to the revolutionary tribunals.
” The Collegium of the All-Russia Cheka objected to the “trans-fer to the various organs of inquiry and investigation”, and considered it “premature to separate from each other (to transfer to various organs) political cases and cases involving large-scale stealing of the public property and official misconduct” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Chicherin went on to describe the improvement of relations with Poland (here Lenin put “2” in the margin, but did not deal with this question in his letter).
Returning to the negotiations with Germany, Chiche-rin continued: “What Hartwig said made it clear that Krasin in Berlin supported the Stinnes line of trustification with? Britain for work in Russia, that he held himself very close? to Stinnes, and even agreed with him about his trip to Brit-ain.
Over here in talks with us Krasin kept yessing us and agreeing with the opposite line—supporting in every way the?? tendency in Germany for separate work (without Britain) in Russia.
While abroad he was doing the opposite!” No.

p.
392 449This platform was an anonymous document expressing the views of some intellectuals, and was issued for the Second All-Russia Proletcult Congress held in Moscow in November 1921.
They cast doubt on the socialist character of the October Revolution and came out against the policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government; in philosophy they stood up for Machist and Bogdanovite “theories”, and in politics adopted the views of the opportunist Workers’ Opposition.
The communist groupof the Second Proletcult Congress condemned the “collectivist” platform and dissociated itself from it Proletcult (Proletarian Culture Organisation) was set up in September 1917 as an independent workers’ organisation.
Pro-letcult, whose direction was in the hands of A.
Bogdanov and his supporters, continued, even after the October Revolution, to maintain its “independence”, thereby setting itself up in op-position to the Communist Party and the proletarian state.
It was not a homogeneous organisation: alongside bourgeois intel-lectuals, who dominated many of its organisations, there were young workers who were sincerely desirous of taking part in cul-tural construction.
In a number of his works, Lenin sharply crit-icised Proletcult’s erroneous views.
Proletcult organisations were most widespread in 1919, but declined in the early 1920s and were dissolved in 1932.

food and seed for the famine-stricken areas.
It stipulated that the pur-chases were to be made by the Hoover’s Commission (ARA).
The Politbureau of the R.

Eiduk considered the Hoover proposal disadvantageous both economi-cally and politically and recommended its rejection, because it would result in an extension of the ARA apparatus, which was engaged in hostile activity against Soviet Russia.
Having discussed the question “of political measures in con-nection with ARA”, the Politbureau on December 31, 1921, authorised a commission, consisting of I.

B.
Krasin in London, S.
E.
C.
Chairman P.
A.
Bogdanov had allegedly written a letter to Leslie Urquhart about resuming the concession talks which he had broken off.
Chicherin felt that Bogdanov’s letter could be interpreted as the Soviet Government’s surrender to private cap-ital, and requested a repudiation.
This question was examined by the Politbureau on January 12, 1922.
In accordance with Lenin’s proposal, the Politbureau instructed I.
S.
Unschlicht, Deputy Chairman of the All-Russia Cheka, to investigate how Bogdanov’s letter to Taube, which had been sent on to Krasin in London, got into Urquhart’s hands.
The Politbureau agreed with the People’s Commissariat for For-eign Affairs that Bogdanov had made a mistake by addressing himself to Taube in circumvention of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and recognised that it was “inadmissible to bring up at the Politbureau questions sharply affecting respon-sible workers (Comrade Bogdanov) without obtaining the neces-sary information beforehand” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Krasin communicated the following approximate text of the Soviet Government’s declaration proposed by Lloyd George as a condition for the recognition of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
by the capi-talist countries and extension of economic assistance to it: “The Soviet Government, with the proviso of its de jure recognition and the extension of assistance to Russia in her rehabilitation, agrees to recognise as binding on itself all the financial obliga-tions of the tsarist and the Provisional Government.
It is fur-thermore proposed that the Soviet Government should pay the losses of foreign governments and private persons, in so far as these losses resulted from the Soviet Government’s acts or omis-sions on its part, provided the foreign governments made good the losses inflicted by them on Russia, with the settlement ofall matters involving losses to be effected by an arbitration trib-unal on the basis of the generally recognised principles of in-ternational law and the principles of trade relations prevailing in civilised countries.
” In the opinion of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Chicherin wrote to the Politbureau, “this proposal is an attempt to blackmail us once again before the session of the Supreme Council”, and it should be rejected, with the declaration that the Soviet Government is prepared to dis-cuss the question of the private debts at a conference.
The Col-legium of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs consid-ered the arbitration tribunal to be absolutely unacceptable, “because there cannot be any impartial arbitration tribunal between the Soviet Republic and the capitalist states”.
Having discussed on December 31, 1921, Krasin’s telegram about Britain’s proposals, the Politbureau of the R.
C.
P.

Mikhailov asked for a telegram stat-ing the amount of the transaction.
After additional negotiations and specification of the terms, the agreement was signed.
p.
428 509Lenin’s proposal sprang from the country’s grave financial position and the need to increase appropriations for schools and the wiping out of illiteracy.

” In connection with this proposal, the Politbureau instructed the People’s Commissariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection “to submit an exact calculation of the maintenance of the Bolshoi Theatre in its present state, and of the reduction of expenditures which could be obtained on its closure”.
On March 13, the Politbureau, having heard the report by V.

Chicherin, in connection with the holiday offered to him, characterised the state of affairs at the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.
He said the work was not going smoothly because of a shortage of trained personnel and added that there was no one at the Com-missariat who was informed about the whole range of questions.
He wrote that it was impossible for him to go on holiday just then.
It would take him several months to hand over his affairs and introduce someone to all his duties at the Commissariat, some-thing it was absolutely impossible to do during the intense preparation for the Genoa Conference.
Chicherin insisted that “ a holiday at the present time is tantamount to my total depar-ture” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Report-ing that HAPAG (Hamburg-America Line) had come to an ar-rangement with the Harriman concern on transferring to the lat-ter one-half of its interest in the German-Russian Transport Com-pany (Derutra), Stomonyakov asked whether this should be agreed to.
A.
M.
Lezhava, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, in a letter to Lenin on January 14, 1922, expressed the opin-ion that this was advantageous not only for HAPAG but also for Soviet Russia, because it was “a very major fact, the first business agreement between us and American capital” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.
P.

Derutra, the German-Russian Transport Company was set up on the basis of a protocol signed in Berlin on May 13, 1921, byStomonyakov and Director Theodor Ritter, a member of the board of HAPAG (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.

450 543A reference to the radio telegram from the Chairman of the Coun-cil of Ministers of Italy, Bonomi, on January 13.
1922, in which, under a decision of the conference of the Allied Supreme Council, held at Cannes from January 6 to 13, he invited, on behalf of the Supreme Council, a Soviet Government delegation to take part in an international economic and financial conference which was to meet at Genoa in early March 1922.
p.
451 544Clause 1 of the Cannes resolution, as published in the Soviet press, said: “No state can claim any right to dictate to another state the principles on which the latter is to regulate its system of ownership, and internal economy and government” (Izvestia VTsIK No.
6, January 10, 1922).
This text corre-sponded with the text of the resolution published in Petit Pari-sien No.
16385 on January 8.
On January 26, G.
V.
Chicherin wrote, enclosing the issue of the paper: “I am sending you Petit Parisien with the Cannes resolution and a copy of Bonomi.
The latter has dropped ‘Système de propriété’.
” Lenin attached great importance to the formulation of § 1 of the Cannes terms, regarding it as an indirect admission of the bankruptcy of the capitalist system of property, and of the inevi-table existence of a communist system of property alongside it.
Lenin pointed out that the other paragraphs of the Cannes terms, designed to enslave Soviet Russia by foreign capital, were clearly at odds with clause one (see present edition, Vol.
33, pp.
356-57).

He ended by saying: “I am taking a great interest in your cause, especially in the organisation of your Soviets, your Army and education.
I should like to know everything you and others may tell me about these things, especially about education.
Like Moscow, I should like to lay the foundations of the Chinese Republic deep in the minds of the young generation—the toilers of the morrow.
“With best wishes to you, to my friend Lenin and to all those who have done so much for the cause of human freedom” (see Bolshevik No.

Having sent on this letter to Lenin on November 6, 1921, Chicherin asked him whether he was personally acquainted with Sun Yat-sen.

Krzhizhanovsky, submitted a detailed memo giving Lenin a progress report on implementing the C.

D.
decision of January 4, 1922, concerning diesel locomotives (see Note 500).
He believed that it was necessary, along with building diesel locomotives to Russian blueprints, to announce an international competition.
He wrote that the work was being carried on in two directions: the drafting of the terms of the international compe-tition and the “working out of outline blueprints of diesel loco-motives for their subsequent construction through the allocation of orders to factories” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

455 553On January 29, 1922, the newspapers carried two radio messages from the Italian Foreign Minister Torretta addressed to G.
V.
Chicherin, one dated January 22, containing a reply to Chiche-rin’s inquiry about the agenda of the Genoa Conference, and the other dated January 27, on the composition of the conference.
In the latter he said that, in accordance with the Cannes decisions of the Supreme Council, among those invited to the conference were “apart from the members of the Supreme Council and Rus-sia, all the states of Europe with de jure recognition” (Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.
V, Moscow, 1961, p.
59).
This “explana-tion” of Torretta’s was taken by some quarters to imply the invi-tation to the conference of the expelled whiteguard governments of Kolchak and Denikin, the Menshevik government of Georgia,the Dashnak government of Armenia, the Musavat government of Azerbaijan and others (which had earlier been recognised by the Entente, and whose recognition had not been revoked).
In this context, L.

Zinoviev’s reply to his letter of January 26 (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edi-tion, Vol.
54, Document 232).
Zinoviev wrote that the Executive Committee of the Comintern, not expecting Lenin to deliver a speech on the question of a united front, wanted to have an article by him on this subject.
As for his speech on the question of NEP and its initial results, it was considered highly important by the Executive Committee of the Comintern in view of the fact that the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals were distorting the meaning of NEP and agitating against the Communists.
See this volume, Document 617.
p.
457 556Lenin did not write a special article on NEP or the country’s economic position.

p.
493606 Written in connection with a discussion of the question of the for-eign trade monopoly which was carried on in the Party’s govern-ing circles at the end of 1921 and throughout the whole of 1922.
The foreign trade monopoly, established by the C.
P.
C.
decree of April 22, 1918, was repeatedly confirmed by Soviet Govern-ment decisions.
The transition to the New Economic Policy and the extension of trade ties with foreign countries called for various additions to legislation on foreign trade.
The “Theses on For-eign Trade” prepared on Lenin’s instructions by A.
M.
Lezhava, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, emphasised the need to consolidate the foreign trade monopoly, and defined the terms for the export and import of goods in the new condi-tions.
The theses were endorsed by Lenin and adopted by the Supreme Economic Commission of the C.
P.
C.
on January 4, 1922.
The retention of the foreign trade monopoly was opposed by G.
Y.
Sokolnikov, N.
I.
Bukharin and G.
L.
Pyatakov.
J.
V.
Stalin, G.
Y.
Zinoviev and L.
B.
Kamenev favoured an easing of the foreign trade monopoly.
On March 4, 1922, the Politbureau of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) C.
C.
adopt-ed, with some amendments, the “Theses on Foreign Trade” ap-proved by Lenin.
In their final form they were approved on March 10.
On the basis of these theses, the Presidium of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
on March 13 adopted its decision “On Foreign Trade”, which was published in Izvestia VTsIK No.
60, on March 15, 1922.
Despite the Politbureau decision of March 4 and 10, Sokolnikov again put forward the plan to allow the trusts, co-operatives and others to purchase food abroad; Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, M.
I.
Frumkin, also came out in favour of easing the foreign trade monopoly, suggesting that only the whole-sale trading in four or five products should be left in the hands of the state as a firm monopoly.
The inner-Party struggle over the foreign trade monopoly was having a negative effect on busi-ness negotiations with foreign capitalists.
In connection with this, Lenin proposed on May 15, 1922, the following Politbureau directive, which was adopted on May 22: “The C.
C.
confirms the foreign trade monopoly and resolves to stop everywhere the elaboration and preparation of the question of integrating the Supreme Economic Council with the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade” (Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p.
484).
However, the struggle did not cease.
On October 6, 1922, the C.
C.
Plenum, with Lenin in and absent, adopted, on a motion by G.
Y.
Zinoviev, a resolution on the basis of Sokolnikov’s theses allowing freedom of import and export for some types of goods or across some frontiers.
On October 11, L.
B.
Krasin sent in a request to the Party Central Committee that the October 6 decision and the “Theses of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade on the Foreign Trade Regime” should be rescinded.
Lenin supported Krasin and protested the decision of the C.
C.
Plenum, pointing out that it was in fact thwarting the foreign trade monopoly, and proposed that the question should bereferred for settlement to the next C.
C.
Plenum in December 1922 (see present edition, Vol.
33, pp.
375-78).
N.
I.
Bukharin came out with objections to Lenin’s letter and L.
B.
Krasin’s theses.
Attaching great importance to the stability of the foreign trade monopoly, but being unable, because of his illness, to attend the C.
C.
Plenum on December 18, 1922, Lenin addressed a letter to it on December 13, in which he sharply condemned Bukharin’s stand.
Considering Lenin’s insistent demands and the Politbureau decisions, J.
V.
Stalin was forced to abandon his erroneous stand.
The C.
C.
Plenum condemned the standpoint of Bukharin and Sokolnikov, rescinded the C.
C.
decision of October 6, and re-affirmed the absolute necessity of maintaining the foreign trade monopoly, without allowing any departures from it.
The Party’s Twelfth Congress, which was held from April 17 to 25, 1923, and in which Lenin was also unable to take part because he was un-well, resolved: “The congress categorically reaffirms the stability of the foreign trade monopoly and the inadmissibility of any cir-cumvention of it or hesitations in implementing it, and instructs the new C.
C.
to take systematic measures to consolidate and develop the regime of foreign trade monopoly” (KPSS v resolu-tsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, conferentsii i plenumov TsKa, Part 1, 1954, p.

Y.
Sokolnikov’s letter in reply to Lenin’s note of February 28 (see this volume, Document 662).
In his letter, Sokolnikov suggested that the trusts, co-opera-tives and others should be allowed to purchase food abroad.
In his opinion, the guarantee that an excess of valuables would not be taken out of the country and that food instead of other goods would be imported in return was these organisations’ extreme need of food, and control by the People’s Commissariat for For-eign Trade and the State Bank, through which all operations should be conducted.

Khinchuk also said that an agreement had been reached with the old Russian co-operators living abroad, who had handed over to Centrosoyuz their valuables and apparatus in Western Europe and America and declared that they were no longer representatives of Russian co-operative societies abroad.

Lenin assessed the Versailles Treaty in these words: “It is an unparalleled and predatory peace which has made slaves of tens of millions of people, including the most civilised” (see present edition, Vol.
31, p.
326).
It was designed to fix the redivision of the capitalist world in favour of the victor powers and to create a system of relations between countries aimed at strangulating Soviet Russia and routing the revolutionary movement through-out the world.

Glavzemkhoz—Central Administration for the Farms of Indus-trial Enterprises of the Republic—was set up in the spring of 1919.
Among the participants in its exhibition which Lenin men-tions were 73 state farms, with over 15,000 dessiatines of farmland, situated closest to Moscow, from Moscow, Ryazan, Tula, Smolensk and Kaluga gubernias.

It existed from April 6, 1920 to November 14, 1922.
The establishment of the Far-Eastern Republic, a “buffer state” with a bourgeois-democratic system, but essentially conducting a Soviet policy, was in Soviet Russia’s interests as she was anxious to avoid an open armed clash with the Japanese imperialists and wanted to assure herself of a long breathing-space on the Eastern Front.
Following the expulsion of the Japanese interventionists, the People’s Assembly of the Far-Eastern Republic, on November 14, 1922, requested the All-Russia C.

Lenin gave an assessment of the Rapallo Treaty in his “Draft Decision of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on the Report of the Delegation to the Genoa Conference” (see present edition, Vol.

530 641 A reference to the situation which had taken shape at the Genoa Conference.
On April 11, 1922, the Soviet delegation was handed the “experts’ report” worked out at a conference of experts from Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium and Japan in London in March (London Memorandum).
It contained demands that the Soviet Government should pay all the debts of the tsarist and Provision-al governments and all the authorities which had existed in Russia, return to foreigners their former property which had been nationalised by the Soviet state, or compensate them for the dam-age inflicted on their property, or for the loss of it, and estab-lish economic and legal privileges for foreigners, and a number of other demands which in fact meant abolition of the foreign trade monopoly.
The official reply of the Soviet delegation to the “experts’ report” was set out in its memorandum of April 20.
The Soviet delegation firmly rejected these demands, qualifying them as an attempt to “introduce in Russia a system of capitulations encroaching on her sovereignty” (Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.
V, Moscow, 1961, p.
235), and put forward counter-claims for compensation of the losses inflicted on Russia by the foreign intervention, stressing that the R.

Government was prepared to negotiate on compensation of the losses of foreign citizens only on the basis of reciprocity.
p.
531642A reference to the uprising of white miners in Witwatersrand, Union of South Africa, in March 1922, which was sparked off by the mining companies’ intensified exploitation of the miners.
Following a drop in the world price of gold, the companies tried to maintain their old profit margins by pressing down wages and massive sackings.
The workers took over the cities of Benoni and Branpan, and the suburbs of Johannesburg—Fordsburg and Jeppe.
The young Communist Party of South Africa took an ac-tive part in the uprising.
Many Communists, including the strike leaders, Fischer and Spendiff, died as heroes in the armed struggle.

p 532 644This telegram of Lenin’s sent to Genoa on April 21, 1922, was in reply to G.
V.
Chicherin’s telegram of April 20, objecting to Lenin’s assessment of the situation at the conference and say-ing that it was “in fact mainly Lloyd George himself who had an interest” in the question of compensating foreigners for the losses arising from the nationalisation of their property, “because pressure was being brought to bear on him by the almighty Brit-ish sharks” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Lenin’s assessment of the stand taken by Lloyd George and other British leaders, given in the telegrams to Genoa (see this volume, Documents 704 and 705), was borne out in the course of the conference.
The British delegation subsequently even went back on the understanding that Chicherin’s letter of April 20 would be taken as a basis for continuing the talks.
In a letter addressed to the conference chairman on April 28, Chicherin pointed out that if the Western Powers repudiated their agree-ment to consider the points in the April 20 letter as a basis for negotiations, the Soviet delegation would not regard itself as being bound by this letter and would return to the standpoint set out in its April 20 memorandum (see Dokumenty vneshnei p.

” Lenin underlined this sentence from Trotsky’s note: “We should ask our delegation to let us have an outline of their main ideas for such a manifesto (otherwise we may well miss some important aspects)” and wrote in the margin: “I agree only with the last sentence.
” That same day, the Politbureau adopted this decision: “To send a telegram to Comrades Chicherin and Litvinov to this effect: ‘In the event of a break-up we consider it necessary to issue a manifesto to the population on behalf of the C.
P.
C.
or the All-Russia C.

Stomonyakov reported that the directors of “Friedrich Krupp in Essen” had refused to approve the agreement on an agricultural concession in Salsk District, Don Region, which their representative had signed in Moscow on March 23, 1922 (see Note 621).
In view of the fact that Krupp plants were work-ing on the railway mission’s orders for locomotives for Soviet Russia, Stomonyakov requested that instructions be sent to the head of the mission, Y.
V.
Lomonosov, to join the trade mission in finding “ways of influencing Krupp and to start applying them”.
The same day, the Politbureau decided to send Stomonyakov the telegram here published.
After additional talks with the company, and specification of the terms of the agreement, the C.

Krasin’s minority opinion on the talks at the Genoa Conference.
Krasin suggested some serious concessions.
In reply to Lenin’s telegram, Chicherin admitted that another conference within three months was preferable to a complete break-up, but added: “Lloyd George is working for an agreement with us, and three months from now the situation in Britain may be much worse for us.
” He went on to say that the Allies were prepared to have concrete discussions on granting Soviet Russia a credit only after the Soviet Government agreed to pay compen-sation to all foreigners who had formerly owned property in Rus-sia (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, M.

Frum-kin, in a letter of May 10, 1922, proposed that wholesale trade in four or five products should be left in the hands of the state (People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade) on the basis of a firm monopoly, with all the other products freely exported by the mixed companies which were to set aside a part of their profits for the state, without it making any capital outlays.
Frumkin argued that state trade was being carried on at a loss, and that under free competition it would be beaten by private trade.
Under the text of Lenin’s letter, there is Stalin’s reply of May 17, 1922.
While not objecting to a formal ban on steps towards a relaxation of the foreign trade monopoly “at the present stage,” he added that nevertheless “a relaxation is becoming inevitable.

A preliminary agreement was signed by L.
B.
Krasin on September 9, 1922 (for the terms see this volume, Document 750).
Having acquainted himself with the agreement, Lenin found it to be patently disadvantageous for the Soviet state, and in a letter to Politbureau members on September 12 came out against its approval (see this volume,Document 754).
Lenin wrote about this in the note to Zinoviev here published.
The commission mentioned by Lenin was set up by the Polit-bureau on August 24, 1922, to specify and put the finishing touches to the draft agreement with Urquhart.
By “American proposals” Lenin apparently means the talks between Krasin and the International Barnsdoll Corporation, with which two agreements were signed on September 20, 1922: one for the exploitation of the Balakhany oil wells in Baku for 15 2 years, and the other for the sinking of new wells.

However, Lenin, the Party C.
C.
and the Soviet Government did not rule out the possibility of returning to the question of granting Urquhart a concession.
In this connection Lenin believed it to be necessary once again to verify most thoroughly all the terms of the concession.
In particular, he proposed a reduc-tion in area of the concession and the amounts Urquhart was to receive (see this volume, Document 768, and also present edi-tion, Vol.

Govern-ment and a consortium of German firms headed by Otto Wolff, which was concluded in Berlin on October 9, 1922.
The protocol setting up the company was signed in Berlin on November 16, 1922.
By the spring of 1923, the company had opened its branches in a number of Soviet cities, among them Moscow, Petrograd and Rostov-on-Don.
The conclusion of the agreement with the Wolff consortium and its ratification creat-ed a strong impression abroad and produced a favourable atmosphere for talks with other businessmen and companies.
However, the consortium subsequently became remiss in its obligations under the agreement, and in 1924 withdrew from the Russo-German Trading Society.

Orjonikidze, and the P.
G.
Mdivani group in the Communist Party of Georgia (it included K.
M.
Tsintsadze and S.
I.
Kavtaradze, to whom Lenin’s telegram is addressed).
The Territorial Committee was conducting a fundamentally correct line, working to bring together the Transcaucasian Re-publics into the Transcaucasian Federation, and resolutely sup-porting the idea of uniting all the Soviet Republics into a single state.
But Orjonikidze did not always display the necessary flex-ibility and caution in pursuing the nationalities policy, allowed some peremptory actions and haste in putting through some measures, not always considering the views and rights of the Cen-tral Committee of the Georgian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
This was used by the Mdivani group, which took a basically wrongapproach to the most important aspects of the Party’s nation-alities policy.
Mdivani and his supporters, constituting a majority on the Georgian Communist Party Central Committee, virtually slowed down the economic and political union of the Transcaucasian Republics, and were intent, in essence, on keeping Georgia isolated; at first the group opposed the formation of the U.
S.
S.

directly instead of through the Transcaucasian Federation.
This played into the hands of the bourgeois nationalists and the Georgian Mensheviks, and at their congresses, conferences and meetings of Party activists, the Georgian Communists justly regarded this as a deviation towards nationalism.

Osinsky objected to the refusal of the interdepartmental conference to include the Shatilov Oats Trust estimates in the budget of the People’s Com-missariat for Agriculture on the grounds that it was operating on a profit-and-loss basis.
Osinsky recalled that when the Trust was set up the need was recognised to subsidise it for three to five years, and pointed out that refusal of material support for the Trust would entail the loss of already invested resources.
He asked Lenin “to exert his personal influence in the sense of fully supplying the Shatilov Trust”.
Osinsky also wrote about the selectionist P.

Pleni-potentiary Representative in Germany, of December 3, 1922.
He gave a positive evaluation to the work of the trade mission in Berlin, reported agreements with some German firms, described the talks being conducted and the great prospects in this respect.
He wrote that these would be destroyed with the lifting of the foreign trade monopoly.
It is indicative, he added, that “some comrades who have been abroad are becoming supporters of the monopoly (Tsyurupa, Vladimirov, Rykov, Avanesov)”.
On the strength of the experience gained abroad, Krestinsky took a firm stand in favour of the foreign trade monopoly (Central Party Ar-chives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Preparing for the speech long before the congress, as far back as November 1922, Lenin began to collect the necessary material: he asked for books and newspaper cuttings, read the report of V.
P.

I.
Khodorov-sky asking him for information about the assistance given to each other by urban and rural cells of the Party.
Judging by the plan, p.

603 761Lenin’s health took a turn for the worse and he was unable to participate in the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets.
On the night of December 16, Nadezhda Krupskaya asked the secretary on duty “to inform Stalin, on behalf of Vladimir Ilyich, that he will not speak at the Congress of Soviets” (see Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
45, p.
473).
The Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets opened in Moscow on December 23, 1922.
It was attended by 2,215 delegates.
Lenin was elected honorary chairman; to stormy applause and the sing-ing of The Internationale the congress adopted a telegram of greetings to Lenin.
On December 26, the congress heard a report on the unification of the Soviet Republics, and the next day, at its final sitting, adopted a decision declaring the need to establish a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

p.
606 765The letter is connected with the “Georgian question”.
After the October (1922) Plenum of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) Central Committee, there was a sharpening of the conflict between the Transcaucasian Territorial Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) and the Mdivani group (see Note 723).
Having met with resistance from the Georgian Communists, the Central Committee of the Commu-nist Party (Bolsheviks) of Georgia, on which the Mdivani group had a majority, resigned on October 22 on the plea of its differ-ences with the Transcaucasian Territorial Committee.
Mdivani’s supporters lodged a complaint with the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) Central Com-mittee.
On November 25, 1922, the Politbureau adopted a deci-sion to send a commission to Georgia, with F.
E.
Dzerzhinsky at its head, to examine urgently the statements by members of the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party who hadresigned, and to work out measures to establish tranquility in the Georgian Communist Party.
Lenin was highly anxious over the “Georgian question”.
On December 12, Dzerzhinsky reported to Lenin the results of his trip.
Lenin was dissatisfied with the work of the commission, believing that it had taken a biased approach to the conflict, and had failed to note the grave errors made by G.
K.
Orjonikidze.
Lenin connected the “Georgian question” with the general ques-tion of establishing the U.
S.
S.
R.
, expressing alarm over whether the principles of proletarian internationalism would be consist-ently implemented in the unification of the Republics.
In his letter, “The Question of Nationalities, or ‘Autonomisation’ ”, he censured Orjonikidze’s action and the connivance at it on the part of the Dzerzhinsky Commission, and of Stalin.
Lenin placed the political responsibility for the whole affair chiefly on Stalin, who was the C.
C.
Secretary General, with reference to his grave mistakes in unifying the Republics (see present edition, Vol.
36, pp.
605-11).
Lenin, far from supporting, in fact criticised the fundamen-tally erroneous stand of Mdivani and his supporters on various aspects of the Transcaucasian Federation and the formation of the U.
S.
S.
R.
(see this volume, Document 777); but considering that at the time the main danger lay in dominant-nation chauvin-ism, and that the task of fighting the latter was to be shouldered mainly by the Communists of the formerly dominant nation, Lenin concentrated attention on the mistakes made by Stalin, Dzerzhinsky and Orjonikidze on the “Georgian question”.
He pointed out that in this matter, especially when, in connection with the unification of the Republics, there was need for “partic-ular circumspection, tact and tractability”, and that “in this case it is better to overdo the tractability and mildness in treating the national minorities than to underdo them”.
That is the con-text in which to view Lenin’s words about his being “on the side of the ‘offended’ in the ‘Georgian conflict’ ” (see this volume, Document 814, and also Collected Works, Fifth (Russian) Edition, Vol.
45, p.
486).

On the plea of ill health, Trotsky said he could not under-take such an obligation.
p.
607 767A reference to the following fact.
After Lenin, with the permis-sion of his doctors, had, on December 21, 1922, dictated a letter to Trotsky on the foreign trade monopoly (see this volume, Doc-ument 811), J.
V.
Stalin, whom a C.
C.
Plenum decision of Decem-ber 18 had made personally responsible for the observance of the medical regimen ordered for Lenin, used offensive languageagainst Nadezhda Krupskaya and threatened to take the case to the Control Commission for having taken down the said letter.
On December 23, 1922, Krupskaya sent Kamenev a letter asking for protection from “the gross interference in my personal life, offensive language and threats”.
Nadezhda Krupskaya apparently told Lenin of this fact in early March 1923.
Having learned about this Lenin dictated the doc-ument here published.
Maria Ulyanova later wrote in a letter to the presidium of the July (1926) Joint Plenum of the Central Committee and the Cen-tral Control Commission of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), at which the question had been raised by G.
Y.
