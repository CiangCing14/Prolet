517PREFACE The thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth volumes contain Lenin’s correspondence with organisations and persons—letters, tel-egrams and notes—during the period from 1895 to 1922.
The documents in these volumes comprise a considerable part of Lenin’s correspondence and form a valuable supple-ment to his writings published in the preceding volumes of the Collected Works.
These documents reflect the immense and varied activity of Lenin in building up the Bolshevik Party, a party of a new type, his irreconcilable struggle against opportunists of all shades, his struggle for the proletarian revolution, for the dictatorship of the proletariat, his leadership of the world’s first Soviet socialist state.
Volume 34 includes letters of Lenin written in the period from November 1895 to November 1911.
The letters of 1895-1901 reflect Lenin’s activities in build-ing up the Social-Democratic Labour Party in Russia, his struggle against Narodism, “legal Marxism” and Econom-ism.
The letters addressed to G.
V.
Plekhanov, Lydia Kni-povich, N.
E.
Bauman and others show how Lenin’s plan for the creation of the first all-Russia newspaper of the rev-olutionary Marxists—Iskra—was carried out; they re-veal Lenin’s leading role in Iskra, and his struggle within the editorial board of the newspaper.
A considerable part of the volume consists of the letters of 1901-04.
A group of letters of this period, addressed to G.
V.
Plekhanov, deal with questions concerning the draft-ing of the revolutionary programme of the proletarian party.
In his correspondence with local committees—those of Kharkov and Nizhni-Novgorod, the St.
Petersburg organi-sation (letters to I.
V.
Babushkin and others), and theOrganising Committee for convening the Second Party Con-gress—Lenin calls on the Social-Democratic organisations in Russia to unite on the basis of the programmatic and organisational principles of Iskra, and gives precise direc-tives for developing Party work and preparing for the Party Congress.
In a number of letters written after the Second Congress Lenin exposes the splitting activities of the Mensheviks, wages a relentless struggle against certain demoralised Bolsheviks (Krasin, Noskov, Galperin) who had gone over to the Mensheviks and helped them gain a majority in the Central Committee.
These are his letters to the Central Committee, to the Siberian Committee, to N.
Y.
Vilonov, A.
M.
Stopani, Rozalia Zemlyachka and others.
The letters to the Caucasian Union Committee reflect Lenin’s leadership of the Bolshevik organisations in the Caucasus.
The letters of the period of the first Russian revolution (1905-07) reflect Lenin’s struggle for the convocation of the Third Party Congress, for the implementation of its decisions, and for the tactical principles of Bolshevism.
Included here are letters to the Central Committee, S.
I.
Gusev, Rozalia Zemlyachka and others.
The letters of the period of Stolypin reaction reveal Lenin’s struggle against liquidationism, Trotskyism, otzovism and ultimatumism, conciliation, and distortions of the theoret-ical principles of the revolutionary Marxist Party.
This volume includes a letter to G.
Y.
Zinoviev in which Lenin brands Trotsky as a despicable careerist and factionalist.
A number of letters published in this volume expose the international revisionists who supported the Russian Men-shevik opportunists.
An important place in Lenin’s correspondence of 1908-11 is occupied by his letters to Maxim Gorky.
The letters in this volume depict Lenin’s struggle to create a Marxist revolutionary party, to rally the Party’s forces and make the Bolsheviks an independent party, a party of a new type, a party of Leninism, a Bolshevik party.
The following letters, which have previously appeared in various publications, are included in Lenin’s CollectedWorks for the first time: to the Editorial Board of Iskra, February 26, 1904; to M.
K.
Vladimirov, August 15, 1904; to the Caucasian Union Committee, December 20, 1904; to the St.
Petersburg organisation of the R.
S.

, Octo-ber-December 1904; Letter to a Comrade in Russia, January 6, 1905; five letters to A.
V.
Lunacharsky, 1905, 1907 and 1908; to Maxim Gorky, February 7, 1908; to P.
Yushkevich, November 10, 1908; two letters to A.
I.
Lyubimov, August and September 1909; a letter to G.
Y.
Zinoviev, August 24, 1909; draft of a letter to the “Trustees”, February-March 1910; to N.
G.
Poletayev, December 7, 1910; to A.
Rykov, February 25, 1911.
Published for the first time is the letter in this volume to G.
D.
Leiteisen, July 24, 1902, in which Lenin notes the union of Russian Social-Democratic organisations around Iskra.
* * * The letters in volumes 34 and 35 are arranged in chrono-logical order; those sent from Russia are dated according to the old style, those sent from abroad are dated according to the new style.
Where Lenin’s manuscript is undated, the editors have given the date at the end of the letter.
Each letter has a serial number and it is stated to whom and where it was sent, the date of writing and the address of the sender.
Besides brief notes, each volume of the letters is provided with an index of deciphered pseudonyms, nicknames and initials.
QXU 1 TO P.
B.
AXELROD 1 You are probably cursing me for this delay.
There were some good reasons for it.
I will recount them in order.
First of all, I was in Vilna.
* I had talks with our people about the Miscellany.
3 Most of them are agreed on the need for such a publication and promise support and supply of material.
Their mood is in general sceptical (I recalled your expression about the pal.
** provinces), as much as to say—we shall see whether it will correspond to agitational tactics, to the tactics of the economic struggle.
I stressed that this would largely depend on us.
Further, I was in Moscow.
I saw no one, for there was no trace of the “Teacher of Life”.
Is he all right? If you know anything about him and have an address, write to him to send it to us, otherwise we cannot find any contacts there.
Great havoc has been played there, 4 but it seems that some people have survived and the work did not cease.
We have material from there—a description of some strikes.
If you have not had it, write and we shall send it to you.
After that I was in Orekhovo-Zuyevo.
Places like this, frequently to be met with in the central industrial area, are extremely peculiar: a purely manufacturing town with tens of thousands of inhabitants, whose only means of liveli-hood is the mills.
The mill management is the sole author-ity.
The mill office “runs” the town.
There is the sharpest division of the people into workers and bourgeois.
Hence * The key is the same as the one we have been using.
2 ** The word “pal.
” has not been deciphered.
—Ed.
the workers’ frame of mind is rather oppositional, but, after the recent smash-up there, so few of our people are left and all of them so closely watched that contacts are very difficult.
However, we shall be able to deliver the literature.
Further, the delay has been due to local trouble.
This also accounts for the meagreness of the material sent.
I don’t like the address in Zurich.
Can’t you find another— not in Switzerland, but in Germany? That would be much better and safer.
Further, in sending your reply—a book on technology, address: Mr.
Luchinsky, Alexandrovsky Iron Works, Chem-ical Laboratory, St.
Petersburg—add, if there is room, other material: pamphlets issued in Geneva, interesting cuttings from Vorwärts, 5 etc.
Write in detail about the Mis-cellany: what material there is already, what is planned, when the first issue will appear, and what exactly is lack-ing for the second.
We shall probably send money, but later on.
Reply as quickly as possible so that we may know wheth-er this method is suitable.
Send the Pole a rendezvous address as quickly as pos-sible, since we need delivery facilities.
The address is: stu-dent Mikhail Leontievich Zakladny, Technological Institute, the same town, ask for Ivanov.
The money for the pub-lication in Russian of his Geschichte, etc.
, has been prom-ised.
* Another request: we are badly in need of ink; as to what kind, you can find out from Mögli, who has it.
Could you send it somehow? Is there no opportunity? Please think it over or ask your “practical men” to do so.
By the way, you asked us to approach them directly.
In that case, tell us: 1) do they know our method and key? 2) do they know who these letters come from? You are now being sent: 1) information about the expul-sion of the Dukhobors; 2) an account about rural workers in the south; and 3) a description of the Thornton mills— for the time being, only the beginning, about a quarter, of this is being sent.
* The publication and its author have not been ascertained.
—Ed.
It is necessary to write with Chinese ink.
Better still, add a small crystal of potassium dïchromate (K 2 Cr 2O 7 ): then it won’t wash off.
Use the thinnest paper possible.
All the best.
Yours.
.

Regards to the comrade.

Petersburg to Zurich First published in part in 1 9 2 3 First published in full 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original2 TO P.
B.
AXELROD We have received the Breslau report.
6 We unstuck it with great difficulty, in the course of which a large part was torn (the letter, thanks to the good paper, remained intact).
Evidently you have not yet received the second letter.
You must use very thin paste—not more than a teaspoonful of starch (and it must be potato starch, not wheat starch, which is too strong) to a glass of water.
Or-dinary (good) paste is needed only for the top sheet and coloured paper, and the paper holds well, under the action of a press, even with the thinnest paste.
At any rate, the method is suitable and it should be used.
I am sending you the end of Thornton.
We have material on the strike 1) at Thornton’s, 2) at Laferm’s, 3) on the Iva-novo-Voznesensk strike, 4) on the Yaroslavl strike (a work-er’s letter, very interesting), and on the St.
Petersburg Boot Manufacturing Factory.
I am not sending it, as we have had no time yet to copy it and because I do not count on being in time for the first issue of the Miscellany.
We have established contacts with the Narodnaya Volya printing-press, 7 which has already put out three things (not ours) and has taken one of ours.
* We are planning to publish a newspaper, 8 in which this material will be printed.
This will be definitely settled in about 12 to 2 months’ time.
If you think the material will arrive in time for the first issue, let us know at once.

AXELROD Dear Pavel Borisovich, I am very, very glad to have succeeded after all in get-ting a letter from you (I received it yesterday, i.
e.
, August 15) and news of you and of G.
V.
Your and his opinions on my literary efforts * (for the workers) have been extremely en-couraging.
There is nothing I have wanted so much, or dreamed of so much, as an opportunity of writing for work-ers.
But how to do this from here? It is very, very difficult, but not impossible, I think.
How is the health of V.
Iv.
? I know only one method—the one by which I am writing these lines.
9 The question is whether it is possible to find a copyist, who will have no easy task.
You, apparently, consider it impossible and this method, in general, unsuit-able.
But I do not know any other.
.
.
.
It is a pity, but I do not despair: if one does not succeed now—one can suc-ceed later on.
Meanwhile, it would be good if you were to write occasionally by the method which you use with your “old friend”.
10 That will enable us to keep in touch, which is the most important thing.
You, of course, have been told enough about me, so there is nothing to add.
I live here all alone.
I am quite well and occupy myself both with the journal 11 and with my big job.
** All the very best.

POTRESOV 12 September 2, 1898 Yesterday I received your letter of August 11 with the list of books and the printed matter—the Archiv.
13 The article of the “eminent political economist” is highly in-teresting and excellently composed.
The author evidently disposed of very rich material, which had luckily fallen into his hands.
Generally speaking, in the journalistic field, he appears to be even a better writer than in the purely economic field.
Archiv, in general, is an interesting journal and I shall certainly subscribe to it for next year.
I should like also to subscribe to some English periodical or newspaper (weekly); can you advise me which to select? I have no idea what there is in the English publicistic field that is most interesting and is available in Russia.
As regards Struve’s article, 14 on which we hold different opinions, it has to be said, of course, that it is impossible to judge accurately of the author’s views from it alone.
It seemed to me, for instance, and still seems to me, that he definitely set himself “general classificatory tasks” (the title itself indicates this), whereas you consider that he set himself “no such tasks”.
.
.
.
That “it is necessary to win our handicraft workers away from so-called people’s industry” is something with which, of course, I am wholly and defin-itely in agreement, and I think that this still confronts our “disciples” 15 as an unsolved problem.
It was in Struve’s article that I saw a plan for solving this problem.
Have you paid attention to N.
G.
’s articles in Russkoye Bogatstvo 16 (in the two last issues) against “materialism and dialectical logic”.
They are highly interesting—from the negative aspect.
I must admit that I am not competentto deal with the questions raised by the author, and I am extremely surprised that the author of Beiträge zur Geschichte des Materialismus * has not expressed his opinion in the Russian literature and does not vigorously oppose neo-Kantianism, letting Struve and Bulgakov 17 polemise on specific questions of this philosophy, as if it had already become part of the views of Russian disciples.
18 Space would surely be found for philosophical articles in more than one of our periodicals; moreover, a book could get through easily.
His polemic with Bernstein and Conrad Schmidt interests me greatly, and I very much regret that I am quite unable to obtain Zeit.
19 I should be greatly ob-liged to you if you could help me in this.
It would be quite sufficient, of course, to receive this journal even for a short period.
Do you have the issue of Die Neue Zeit (of a few years ago) which carried an article by the same author on Hegel (the 30th Anniversary of his death—something of that kind)? 20 Neither I nor any of the comrades here get Die Neue Zeit, although they promised to send it from St.
Petersburg! The devil take all those people who make prom-ises and do not keep them! Another interesting article is that of Ratner’s on Capital in Russkoye Bogatstvo (for July).
I cannot stand such lovers of the golden mean, who do not dare to come out openly against doctrines with which they have no sympathy, but wriggle, make “amendments”, evade the main issues (such as the theory of the class struggle) and beat about the bush of particulars.
The articles by another author in Die Neue Zeit on social trends in Russia also sound very interesting 21 : your men-tioning them is extremely tantalising.
If I have understood you rightly, this author expresses an idea already expound-ed by him elsewhere (on the danger of einer politischen Isolierung des russischen Proletariats**).
It seems to me that “alienation from society” does not necessarily signify “iso-lation”, *** for there is society and society: in fighting Na-* The author of this book was G.

rodism 23 and all its offshoots, the disciples thereby come closer to those gauches * who tend to break decisively with Narodism and adhere consistently to their views.

A “con-ciliatory” (or, rather, alliancist) attitude towards such people is wholly compatible, in my opinion, with the fight against Narodism and all its manifestations.
Please write.
All the best.

POTRESOV January 26, 1899 I have received your letter of December 24.
I am very glad that you have at last got rid of your illness, of which rumours had even reached us.
I heard of it during the holi-days while I was in Minusinsk, and kept thinking where and how I could obtain news of you.
(I thought it inconve-nient to write to you directly, as you were said to be se-riously ill.
) Well, you have now revived just in time for a literary undertaking which is also being revived.
Of course, you know already about Nachalo, 25 which is to be started in the middle of February.
I hope you have now fully recovered—it is already a month since you wrote the last letter—and that you will be able to work.
You are probably fairly well provided for in the matter of books and order the chief new ones? If you are not too short of funds for ordering books, I think you can work even in the backwoods—at least I judge by myself, comparing my life in Samara seven years ago, when I was reading almost exclusively other people’s books, and now, when I have be-gun to acquire the habit of ordering books.
In regard to the Heritage I have had to agree with your opinion that to consider it as something of an integral na-ture is a bad tradition of the bad years (the eighties).
Perhaps I really ought not to tackle historico-literary themes.
.
.
.
My justification is that nowhere do I propose acceptance of Skaldin’s heritage.
26 That one must take over the heri-tage from other people is indisputable.
It seems to me that my defence (from possible attacks of opponents) will be the note on p.
237, where it was precisely Chernyshevsky 27 I had in mind and where I gave reasons why it was inconve-nient to take him as a parallel.
* It is admitted there that Skaldin is a Liberalkonservativ, that he is “not typical” * “The Heritage We Renounce” (see pp.
491-534, footnote on p.
505).
—Ed.
present edition, Vol.
2,of the sixties, that it is “inconvenient” to take “typical” writers; I did not have Chernyshevsky’s articles and do not have them, moreover the chief ones have still not been republished, and I should hardly be able to avoid snags here.
Furthermore, I would begin defending myself by pointing to the fact that I gave an exact definition of what I under-stand by the “heritage” of which I am speaking.
Of course, if the article nevertheless gives the impression that the au-thor proposes to accept precisely Skaldin’s heritage, this is a fault that cannot be remedied.
I forgot what is perhaps my chief “defence”, namely, that if Skaldin is a “rarity”, then bourgeois liberalism, more or less consistent and free from Narodism, is by no means a rarity, but a very broad trend of the sixties and seventies.
You retort: “Coincidence and continuity are poles apart”.
But the crux of the matter is that the article says it is necessary to purge bourgeois liberalism of Narodism.
If this is true and if it is feasible (a particularly important condition!), then the result of the purge, the residue after it, will be bourgeois liberalism that not only coincides with Skaldin’s but is its successor.
Thus, if I am accused of accepting Skaldin’s heritage, I shall be entitled to answer that I am merely undertaking to purge it of admixtures, but that I myself have nothing to do with it and, in addition to cleaning various Augean stables, have more congenial and more positive occupa-tions.
.
.
.
Well, I’m afraid I have let myself be carried away and really imagine myself a “defendant”! We have not corresponded for such a long time that to tell you the truth I have forgotten when I last wrote you about the articles “Die historische Berechtigung”.
I believe I wrote before I received them? * Now I have read them and have found that the author’s main idea is fully accept-able (especially at the end concerning the two extremes or snags that have to be avoided).
In giving the reasons, however, one should really bring out more sharply the Klassencharakter of the Bewegung ** of which the author speaks (he mentioned it, but only in passing and very briefly), and furthermore not to regard the Fronde-like * See p.
26 of this volume.
—Ed.
** Movement.
—Ed.
agrarians with such favour; in their liberalism there is more of the Fronde and of a sense of grievance on account of einundsechzig * than of a desire for “the most rapid industrialisation” of the country.
It is worth while recalling their attitudes towards seasonal work, migration, etc.
The author should have formulated the task more accurately: to free all fortschrittliche Strömungen ** from the rubbish of Narodism and agrarianism and to utilise all of them in this purified form.
In my opinion, “utilise” is a much more exact and suitable word than Unterstützung und Bundes-genossenschaft.
*** The latter indicates the equality of these Bundesgenossen,**** yet they must (in this I fully agree with you) follow in the wake, sometimes even “with clenched teeth”; they have absolutely not grown so far as to reach equality and will never grow to reach it, owing to their cowardice, disunity, etc.
Unterstützung, however, will come by no means from the Intelligenz und fortschrittliche Grundbe-sitzer5 alone, but also from many others, both from Semites and from fortschrittliche Kaufleute und Industrielle 6 (the author has quite wrongly passed them over: it is still a question whether they constitute a smaller percentage in their milieu than in that of the Grundbesitzer 7 ) and those Bauern 8 who tend to represent Urteil and not Torurteil, Kukunft and not Vergangenheit 9 of their class, and very many others.
In two respects the author has tipped the scales in the other direction: firstly, in combating the Economists he has left aside praktische, immediate For-derungen, 10 which are important not only for industriel-len Arbeiter, but also for Hausindustrielle and Landarbei-ter, 11 etc.
Secondly, he has fought against an abstract, * Sixty-one (1861).

neglectful attitude to gemässigten fortschrittlichen * ele-ments (it is fair to say that they should by no means be en-tirely neglected, they should be utilised) and thereby, as it were, obscured the independent and more resolute position adopted by the Bewegung he represents.
In the historico-philosophical sense the proposition which he advances (and which was earlier advanced by Inorodzew in Soziale Prax-is 28 ) is indisputable, viz.
, that among our present Genos-sen ** there are no few verkleideten Liberalen.
*** To a certain extent this can also be said of Deutschland versus England.
That is, so to speak, our good fortune; it enables us to count on an easier and swifter beginning; it compels us to utilise all these verkleideten.
But the author’s formu-lation can, perhaps, give rise to some misinterpretation (one Old-Believer told me: but this is belittling and depersonalis-ing.
.
.
), on the, one hand, and a certain feeling of distrust and embarrassment among Genossen.
In this respect Ino-rodzew’s formulation, too, in my opinion, was unfortunate.
As regards the heart of the matter, however, I think there are no differences of opinion with the author.
About Parvus, I haven’t the slightest notion of his per-sonal character and do not at all deny his great talent.
Unfortunately, I have read very few of his works.
Do you expect to obtain Kautsky’s Die Agrarfrage, **** which has recently come out? Regarding Wert, Yevg, Solovyov and M.
Filippov, I must say that the first-named I do not know at all, and I have read very little of the other two.
That there is and will be “weathering”, I have not an iota of doubt.
Hence it is espe-cially necessary to have not only verkleidete Literatur.

POTRESOV April 27, 1899 I was very glad, A.
N.
, to receive your letter of March 27, which at last broke your long and persistent silence.
A heap of questions to be discussed has indeed accumulated but there is no opportunity of having any detailed conversation here on subjects that are mainly of a literary nature.
And now there is the journal 29 : without talks with one’s col-leagues one feels too cut off for writing.
There is only Ju-lius, who takes all this quite closely and actively to heart, but the accursed “long distances” prevent sufficiently de-tailed conversation with him.
I shall begin with what interests and agitates me now most of all—Bulgakov’s article in issues 1-2 and 3 of Na-chalo.
On reading your opinion of him, I was exceedingly pleased to meet with sympathy on the most essential point— the more so because, apparently, one cannot count very much on sympathy from the editorial board.
.
.
.
If Bulgakov’s article made a “repellent” and “pitiful” impression on you, it absolutely infuriated me.
Up till now, though I have read and re-read Bulgakov, I simply cannot understand how he could write an article so completely nonsensical and in such an extremely unbecoming tone, and how the editors found it possible not to dissociate themselves by at least a single comment from such a slashing attack on Kautsky.
Like you, I am “convinced that our people are utterly [just so!] confused and puzzled”.
And who wouldn’t be puzzled when told—in the name of “modern science” (No.
3, p.
34)—that Kautsky is all wrong, arbitrary, so-cially incredible, “with equally little of both real agronomics and real economics” (No.
1-2) and so forth? Moreover, Kaut-sky is not expounded, but simply distorted, while Bulga-kov’s own views as part of any coherent system are entirely lacking.
No man with any sense of party spirit or sense of responsibility to all the Genossen and their whole programme and practical activity would dare to take such “side kicks” (to use your apt expression) at Kautsky, without giving anything himself, but merely promising .
.
.
a learned work on “Ost-Elbe”! Apparently, he feels himself free from all comradely obligations and responsibility, a “free” and individual spokesman of professorial science.
I do not for-get, of course, that under Russian conditions it is impossible to demand of a journal that it admit some Genossen and exclude others—but a journal like Nachalo is not an alma-nac, allowing Marxism just because it is the mode (à la Mir Bozhy, 30 Nauchnoye Obozreniye, 31 etc.
), but an organ of a definite trend.
It is incumbent on such a journal, there-fore, to put a certain restraint on learned “kickers” and on all “outsiders” in general.
It is to the fact that its editors have run it as an organ of a definite trend and not as an almanac that Novoye Slovo 32 owes its great success.
I read through Kautsky’s book before Bulgakov’s article appeared and I did not find in the latter a single at all in-telligent argument against Kautsky.
What I did find was a heap of distortions of Kautsky’s ideas and theses.
What sheer nonsense Bulgakov talks when he asserts, for example, that Kautsky confuses technics and economics, that he tries to prove the “ruin of agriculture” (No.
3, p.
31.
Kautsky says just the opposite: S.
289), that he denies agriculture any tendency to develop (No.
3, p.
34), and so on! I have already written, and sent to the editorial board a fortnight ago, a first article on “Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr.
Bulgakov’s Article)” and am now starting on a second dealing with the end of Bulgakov’s article.
* I greatly fear that P.
B.
will reject it, either on ac-count of its considerable length (it turns out to be larger than Bulgakov’s article, firstly, because I have to give reasons for refuting such unsupported and carelessly pronounced verdicts as, for example, that Marx was wrong in teaching that the ratio decreases in agriculture; secondly, because * See present edition, Vol.
4, pp.
105-59.
—Ed.
it is essential to expound Kautsky), or because a polemic is considered undesirable (of course, I have not used in the article a single abusive expression, like those above, and in general I have tried to avoid anything personal against Bulgakov.
The tone in general is in no way sharper than in my article against Tugan-Baranovsky 33 on the theory of the market * ).
I should be very glad to hear your opinion, when you have read Kautsky’s book and finished reading Bulgakov: what exactly do you find “true” in Bulgakov? And do you think it possible to let Bulgakov’s article in the journal go unanswered? In general, all this “new critical trend” in Marxism, espoused by Struve and Bulgakov (P.
B.
is apparently in favour of Bulgakov), looks highly suspicious to me: resound-ing phrases about “criticism” against “dogma” and so forth— and absolutely no positive results of the criticism.
Moreover, compiling an article à la Bulgakov required, besides “crit-icism” and sympathy for professorial “modern science”, tactlessness nec plus ultra.
I sent Struve a reply to his article on the market.
** My sister 34 writes to me that this reply will be published in Nauchnoye Obozreniye and that P.
B.
intends to answer it in the same journal.
I cannot agree with you that “the crux of the question lies in the concrete impossibility of an ab-stractly conceivable proposition” and my main argument against P.
B.
is precisely that he mixes up abstract-theoreti-cal and concrete-historical questions.
“Concretely impos-sible” is not only realisation as put forward by Marx, but also land rent as put forward by him, and average profit, and the equality between wages and the value of labour-power, and much more besides.
But the impossibility of something being realised in a pure form is not a refutation.
I am quite unable to see any contradiction between my assertions in the Studies 35 and in Nauchnoye Obozreniye, nor do I see the “bourgeois apologetics” with which Struve has been trying to frighten readers.
What I find most objec-* “A Note on the Question of the Market Theory (Apropos of the Polemic of Messrs.
Tugan-Baranovsky and Bulgakov)” (see pre-sent edition, Vol.
4).

** “Once More on the Theory of Realisation” (see present edi-tion, Vol.
4).
—Ed.
tionable in his article is the fact that he drags in critical philosophy and that he makes remarks such as that Marx’s theory of value and profit “indisputably suffers from a con-tradiction”.
P.
B.
is perfectly well aware that this is dis-putable—why then sow confusion in the minds of our peo-ple, who so far have received no systematic proof of this con-tradiction and its correction from any single spokesman of the “new critical trend”? And Bulgakov’s sally (No.
3, p.
34, note) against the theory of Zusammenbruch * !—without any mention of Bernstein and with the irrevocable authority of a “learned” decree! I know about the publication of Bernstein’s new book and I have ordered it but it is hardly likely to be sent.
The article about it in the Frankfurter Zeitung 36 and in Zhizn 37 (not a bad journal! Its literary section is really good, even better than any others!) has quite convinced me that I did not rightly understand Bernstein’s disjointed articles and that he has got himself so tangled up in lies that he really deserves to be begraben, ** as the author of Beiträge zur Ge-schichte des Materialismus*** expressed it in an open letter to Kautsky.
Bernstein’s arguments, which are new to me, against the materialist conception of history, **** etc.
, are (according to Zhizn) astonishingly feeble.
If P.
B.
is such an ardent defender of Bernstein that he is all but prepared to “quarrel” over him, it is very, very sad, because his “theory” against Zusammenbruch—excessively narrow for Western Europe—is altogether unsuitable and dangerous for Russia.
Do you know that it is already being made use of by our “young” people (ultra-Economists), who in one publication gave an account of the Stuttgart debates in such a way that for them Bernstein, Peus, and others were defenders of “economics, not politics”? What does P.

Incidentally, do you remember how one of our common **** 38 friends in the “beautiful faraway” maliciously ridiculed and soundly scolded me for having called the materialist conception of history a “method”? And behold, it turns out that Kautsky, too, in using the same word: “method”, is guilty of the same grievous sin.
(Zhizn, January, Book II, p.
53.
) Have you any news of this friend? Is his health better? Is there any hope that he will write?think of such “allies”? If by the successes of the ultra-Econ-omists you mean the resignation of Volgin and his closest comrades, I know about it 39; it was a great shock to me and I am now puzzled as to how matters stand and what the future has in store.
I think it terribly harmful that this dispute with the ultra-Economists was not fully and com-pletely ventilated in the press: it would have been the only serious way of clearing things up and establishing certain precise theoretical propositions.
Instead, there is now com-plete chaos! My book has come out * and I have asked that it should be sent to you (I have not yet received it myself).
I have heard that the P.
S.
to the preface was late, came under the preliminary censorship and, it seems, “got into trouble”.
I shall await your comments with interest.
I ordered Karelin’s book and read it before I received it from you.
I liked it very much; it is devilishly annoying that it was pared down! Aren’t you going to write a review of it? An acquaintance of mine has sent me A.
P.
’s “Magazine Notes” (on the “heritage” and the “inheritors”).
I wonder whether the continuation intended to carry on a further polemic with me or not? I liked A.
P.
’s article very much; the issue was much the worse for the cuts in the article.
Truth to tell, I see no differences of opinion between us: you deal with a different question—not what the attitude of the disciples is to Russian democracy in general and wheth-er they reject it (I wrote exclusively about this), ** but what the relations were between democrats of various types in the good old days.
I was concerned only with Mikhailov-sky’s 40 mistake in supposing that we reject democracy altogether—whereas you fasten on his other mistake, the “slur-ring over” of substantially important distinctions in the “heritage”.
I saw Maslov’s note in No.
3 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye directed against me, but to tell you the truth I was not interested in it.
By the way, the cuts in A.

In general, I find the tone of the journal that of a dying body.
If that is so, the end and death is only a ques-tion of time.
It is simply speculation on Ratlosigkeit * and bureaucracy in the department which, etc.
One could hold one’s tongue without any harm and not without advantage to the cause.

POTRESOV June 27, 1899 Last Friday, the 18th, I received your letter of June 2, but I have not received either Mehring or Karelin, about which you write.
I waited a little at first, thinking there was a delay in the post, but now I am forced to believe that either the parcel has been lost or you put off sending it.
If the former is the case, lodge a complaint at once.
Your comments on my book * gave me great joy.
All the same, I think you are exaggerating in speaking about a translation of it: I doubt whether the Germans would want to read a thing so crammed with facts of purely local and minor significance.
True, they translated N.
—on 44 (but then he already had a great reputation and the recom-mendation, probably, of Engels, although the latter had intended to make hay of it, according to Monist).
Have you come across reviews of it in the German literature? If I am not mistaken, they have translated him into French too.
I was somewhat surprised at your statement that you “at last succeeded in obtaining” my book.

Didn’t you receive it from Moscow or St.
Petersburg? I asked that it should be sent to you, as to all the rest of my friends, and they all got it.
If you have not received it, let me know and I shall write again to Moscow.
So far I have not seen any reviews of it in the press, but I don’t expect to find any before the autumn—but then the only newspaper I read is Russkiye Vedomosti, 45 which continues to maintain a “tact-ful silence”.

I have read Bulgakov’s article in Archiv.
I do not in-tend to write a reply to him for the German public too: for one thing, I couldn’t do it in German; secondly—and this is the chief thing, for it would be possible, perhaps, to find a translator from Russian—an article of the kind that I wrote for the Russian public, i.
e.
, with a detailed exposition of Kautsky’s book, would be quite unsuitable for the German public.
I cannot answer Bulgakov’s special references (from German statistical data) for I have no ma-terial.
Nor would I undertake to write for the Germans about his general standpoint (Kantian and .
.
.
Bernsteinian, if one can use the term).
I think it really is necessary to correct the Germans’ idea of the Russian disciples, but for this (unless someone would undertake to write a special article) a simple paragraph about my article against Bulga-kov, when this article is published in a Russian journal, would suffice.
* But if it is not published at all—owing to the demise of Nachalo and the refusal of Zhizn, or the cen-sorship—then the matter will take quite a different turn.
Regarding the “sensational discoveries” of the Russian disciples and their neo-Kantianism, I am becoming more and more indignant.
I have read Tugan-Baranovsky’s ar-ticle in No.
5 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye.
.
.
.
What utterly stupid and pretentious nonsense! Without any historical study of Marx’s doctrine, without any new researches, on the basis of schematic errors (arbitrary alteration of the norm of surplus-value), on the basis of elevating to a gen-eral rule an exceptional case (raising the productivity of labour without decreasing the value of the product: an absurdity if this is taken as a general phenomenon)—on the basis of this to talk about a “new theory”, about Marx’s mistake, about reconstruction.
.
.

No, I cannot believe your statement that Tugan-Baranovsky is becom-ing more and more a Genosse.
Mikhailovsky was right in calling him an “echo man”: his article in Mir Bozhy (“according to Beltov”, you remember? in 1895) and * Lenin refers to the article “Capitalism in Agriculture (Kautsky’s Book and Mr.
Bulgakov’s Article)” (see present edition, Vol.
4) The article was published in the journal Zhizn in Jan.
-Feb.
1900.
—Ed.
this article confirm the severe judgement of the prejud-iced critic.
It is confirmed also by what I have heard about his personal qualities from you and from Nadya.
Of course, all this is not enough to draw a final conclusion and I am quite likely to be mistaken.
It would be interesting to know your opinion of his article.
And then there’s this idea of distinguishing between “sociological” and “economic” categories, set going by Struve (in No.
1 of Nauchnoye Obozreniye) and repeated both by P.
Berlin (in Zhizn) and by Tugan-Baranovsky.
In my view it promises nothing but an utterly meaningless and scholastic play at definitions, to which the Kantians give the resounding name of “critique of concepts” or even “gnosiology”.
I simply cannot understand what sense there is in such a distinction.
How can there be something economic apart from social? Incidentally, concerning neo-Kantianism.
What stand do you take? I have read and re-read with great pleasure Beiträge zur Geschichte des Materialismus, I have read the articles of the same author in Neue Zeit against Bernstein and Conrad Schmidt (Neue Zeit, No.
5, 1898-99; the later issues I have not seen), 46 I have read Stammler (“Wirt-schaft und Rech”) * whom our Kantians (P.
Struve and Bulgakov) have so highly praised, and I definitely side with Monist.
Stammler especially rouses my indignation; I fail to see in him even a hint of anything fresh and significant.

Sheer erkenntnistheoretische Scholastik ** ! Stupid “defini-tions” of a mediocre lawyer, in the worst sense of this last word, and no less stupid “conclusions” drawn from them After Stammler, I re-read the articles of Struve and Bulga-kov in Novoye Slovo and found that neo-Kantianism was a thing to be seriously reckoned with.
I could no longer re-strain myself and stuck in my comments and attacks against it, both in reply to Struve (on his article in Nauchnoye Oboz-reniye.

But it is not there.
Meanwhile, my silence is beginning to make things awkward for me: for example, Nezhdanov’s article in Zhizn No.
4 47 ) and in reply to Bulgakov.
I say, “I could no longer re-strain myself” for I am only too well aware of my lack of philosophical education and I do not intend to write on these subjects until I have learned more.
That is just what I am now doing—I have started with Holbach and Helvètius, and am now taking up Kant.
I have got hold of the chief works of the chief classical philosophers, but I do not have the neo-Kantian books (I have only ordered Lange).
Tell me, please, whether you or your comrades have them and whether you could not share them with me.
On the same subject I have been greatly interested by the review in No.
5 of Nachalo (May issue, which is in the last stages of consumption) on Bogdanov’s book.
I don’t understand how I could have missed the notice of this book’s publication.
I have only now ordered it.
Al-ready from Bogdanov’s first book I suspected Monist, and the title and contents of the second book strengthen my suspicions.
And how disgustingly pointless and disgust-ingly supercilious this review is! Not a word on the real issue and .
.
.
a reprimand for ignoring Kantianism, although it is evident from the reviewer’s own words that Bogdanov does not ignore Kantianism, but refutes it, having a different standpoint in philosophy.
.
.
.
I think (if I am not mistaken about Bogdanov) it is impossible to let this review go unan-swered.
48 The only thing I can’t understand is how Ka-mensky could have left unanswered the articles of Struve and Bulgakov in Novoye Slovo against Engels.
Could you explain this for me? Your information about the reaction against Marxism which has begun in St.
Petersburg was news to me.
I am puzzled.
“Reaction”—does that mean among the Marxists? And which ones? P.
B.
again? Is it he and his Co.
who are developing a tendency to unite with the liberals? I am looking forward to your explanations with great impatience.
I fully agree that the “critics” are only confusing our people, while giving absolutely nothing, and that a serious fight with them (especially over Bernstein) will be necessary (only will there be somewhere to fight.
.
.
? ).
If P.
B.
“absolutelyceases to be a Genosse”—so much the worse for him.
It will be a great loss, of course, for all Genossen, for he is very tal-ented and knowledgeable, but, of course, “friendship is friendship, but service is service”, and this does not do away with the need to fight.
I fully understand and share your “fury” (caused by the epithet “loathsome” [sic!] in regard to Monist—because of what? because of the article in Neue Zeit? because of the open letter to Kautsky about who will begraben whom?) and I am eager to know about his answer to your letter giving vent to this fury.
(I have not yet seen Bernstein’s book).
Gründliche Auseinanderset-zung is necessary, of course, but it will not and cannot appear in Nachalo or Zhizn: only specific articles against the “critics” of Marxism will be published.
What is required for it is a third kind of literature * and Platform (if I have understood you rightly).
Only then, at last, the Genossen will be dissociated from “outsiders” and “kickers”, and only then will no kind of personal whimsies or theoretical “sensational discoveries” be able to produce confusion and anarchy.
The accursed Russian disorganisation is wholly to blame here! It is not clear to me in what way your article on the her-itage (I have read only the first one) was aimed at the St.
Petersburgers.
I have not seen the article “Out of Turn”.
Send it to me.
I should very much like to have a more detailed and circumstantial talk about the Blitzableiter.
** But this, evi-dently, will have to be left for another time.
My term of exile ends on January 29, 1900.
I hope they don’t extend it—a calamity that not infrequently strikes exiles in Eastern Siberia.
I am dreaming of Pskov.
And you? Nadya sends her regards.

tone there is conciliatory; implying, as it were: I am an “orthodox” and vigorous opponent of the “critics” (that I said plainly), but we must not exaggerate these disagreements [as Mr.
Bulgakov does] in the face of common enemies.
It is quite possible that this “conciliatory” tone [I have tried my hardest to be mild and polemise as a Genosse] will prove inappropriate or even ridiculous if expressions like “loathsome” are employed, and if the “critics” cause a definitive cleavage.
In that case I should find myself “guilty though guiltless”; not having seen Bernstein’s book, not knowing all the views of the “critics”, and being at a “respectable distance”, my view [when I wrote that article] was quite an “old one”, simply that of a contributor to Nachalo.

It looks as if my statement about the theory of the class struggle not having been touched on by the “crit-ics” is incorrect? 49 Sent from Shushenskoye village to Orlov, Vyatka Gubernia First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the originalQPP 8 TO NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA 50 I have long been intending to write to you about affairs, but various circumstances have always interfered.
My life here is all bustle, even painfully so—and this (N.
B.
) despite the extraordinary precautions taken against it! I live al-most, one might say, in solitude—and yet there is this bustle But then I suppose it’s unavoidable in every new situation, and it would be a sin to complain, seeing that I am not half as nervy as our dear bookseller 51 who succumbs to black melancholy and momentary prostration under the influence of this bustle.
But there is much that is good be-sides the bustle.
Well, I shall now tell you something about the affairs of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, and I shall do so on the basis of facts and accounts of the other side.
.
.
.
In the first place, a completely wrong idea of Vademecum prevails in Russia as a result of the cock-and-bull stories of the Rabocheye Dyelo supporters.
To hear them—it is nothing but indulgence in personalities, and so forth, nothing but acting general and making mountains out of molehills for the sake of denigrating individuals, nothing but the use of “impermissible” methods, etc.
Actually, this thing is a major issue of principle, and the attacks on indi-viduals are merely an appendage, an appendage that is inevitable in view of the confused relations which the “young” have tried to create and aggravate to the utmost Vademecum is an outcry, a forthright outcry against banal Economism, against the “shame and disgrace” of Social-Democracy.
“I never thought I would have to experience such shame,” exclaims Plekhanov at the end of the preface to the documents he has published.
“Wemust get out of this chaotic and disgraceful situation at all costs.
Woe to the party that patiently tolerates such confusion!” And against all the various accusations levelled at Plekhanov we must first of all categorically establish that the whole essence of his pamphlet is precisely declara-tion of war against the “disgraceful” principles of “Credo-ism” and “Kuskova-ism”, precisely a split over principles, and the split and “fracas” in the Union are merely a side effect of this dissension over principles.
If the split over principles has been combined with this “fracas” (at the Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad in April 1900, things literally came to the pitch of brawling, hysteria, and so on and so forth, which led to Plekhanov’s resignation), if things took this turn, the blame for it rests with the young.
It was from the standpoint of Economism that the young waged a system-atic, stubborn and dishonest struggle against the Eman-cipation of Labour group during 1898—“dishonest” because they did not show their colours openly, because they base-lessly put all the blame on “Russia” (keeping silent about the anti-“Economist” Social-Democrats of Russia), and be-cause they have used their connections and practical resources to push aside the Emancipation of Labour group in order to declare the latter’s unwillingness to let in “disgraceful” ideas and disgraceful stupidity to be an unwillingness to let in all “young forces” in general.
This struggle against the Emancipation of Labour group, this pushing it aside, was carried out on the sly, in a “private” fashion, by means of “private” correspondence and “private” conversations— plainly and bluntly speaking, by means of intrigue, be-cause the role of the Emancipation of Labour group in the Russian Social-Democratic movement never was, never will be and never can be a private matter.
The young proclaimed “new” views against the old, but concealed those views so artfully and diplomatically (thereby showing that for them the very question of views was a private matter) that it was left for the old to set forth the gist of the disputes.
“We sent to St.
Petersburg an account of our disputes with the young ones” writes Plekhanov (p.
XLVII of Vademecum).
Thus, as early as 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group proved that for it the whole question lay in the vacillationover principles on the part of the young, who were capable of sinking as low as complete denial of socialism.
As early as 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group came out with an appeal to Russian Social-Democrats against ideological waverings, 52 but this appeal proved to be the voice in the wilderness, since after the arrests in the summer of 1898 all outstanding leaders of the Party were swept from the battlefield and only the voice of the Economists responded to the appeal.
It is not surprising that after this the Emancipation of Labour group resigned from the editorial board, it is not surprising that open war against Economism became more and more urgent and inevitable.
But here, to the aid of the Economic trend, came people who were united to these Economists by long-standing hostility towards the Eman-cipation of Labour group and these people did not shrink from the attempt to abet Economism, without washing dirty linen in public, and to enable the Economists to con-tinue, with greater convenience than ever before, the tactics of “private” propaganda of their views under the flag of Social-Democracy and under cover of ambiguous statements by the new editorial board, which wanted to imitate that dear little calf who sucked two mothers at once.
In the very first issue of Rabocheye Dyelo the new editors declared that they “do not know what young comrades P.
B.
Axelrod is talking about” in attacking the Econo-mists.
They declared this despite the fact that the whole history of the Union in recent years was a history of its struggle with the “young”; they declared this despite the fact that one of the members of the editorial board of Rabo-cheye Dyelo was himself an adherent of the Economic trend (Mr.
V.
I—n).
53 To an outsider, to one who has not pon-dered over the history of Russian Social-Democracy and the Social-Democratic Union Abroad during the last few years, it may seem quite incomprehensible and strange that such a slight and (apparently) casual remark dropped by the editors of Rabocheye Dyelo (“we do not know what young comrades P.
B.
Axelrod is talking about”) could spark off the most passionate polemics, ending in the split of the Union and its disintegration.
Yet there is nothing strange about this seemingly strange phenomenon.
Theslight remark of Rabocheye Dyelo’s editors in connection with their publication of Mr.
V.
I—n’s articles fully and clearly revealed the cardinal distinction between two concep-tions of the immediate tasks and most urgent demands of Russian Social-Democracy.
The first conception can be ex-pressed in the words laissez faire, laissez passer in relation to Economism.
These are tactics of a conciliatory attitude to Economism, the tactics of concealing the “extremes” of Economism, of defending Economism against open struggle against it, the tactics of “free criticism”, i.
e.
, free crit-icism of Marxism on the part of all overt and covert ideol-ogists of the bourgeoisie.
The other conception required a resolute struggle against Economism, an open protest against the threatening vulgarisation and narrowing of Marxism, an irrevocable break with bourgeois “criticism”.
Written in August prior to 2 4 th, 1 9 0 0 Sent from Switzerland to Ufa First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original9 ADDRESSEE UNIDENTIFIED September 5, 1900 Nuremberg Comrade, It looks as if we shall not be able to meet—we are not going to either Mainz or Paris and leave here tomorrow.
54 It is a great pity, but we must accept the situation and con-fine ourselves to conversing by post.
Firstly, I hasten to correct a remark in your first letter, a correction I would ask you to convey also to the person who told you of my “promise to meet”.
That is not true.
I did not promise to meet, but said that we would officially (i.
e.
, on behalf of our group 55) get in touch with the Union 56 when we were abroad, if this appeared to be necessary.
It was wrong of G.
57 to forget about this condition, and to forget besides to tell you that I spoke with him in a personal ca-pacity and, consequently, could not have promised any-thing definite in anticipation of our group’s decision.
When we heard out the other side here 58 and learned about the congress and the split, we saw that there was now no need for an official contact.
That’s all.
Consequently, the Union has no right whatever to “lay claim” to me, whereas I claim that G.
told certain other persons of our conversation, al-though he had formally promised me that, prior to our group making contact with the Union, he would inform no one except the arrested person.
Since you have informed me of his claim, I hope you will not refuse, being in Paris, to inform him likewise of this claim of mine.
If “the rumour is heavy on the ground”, 59 it is G.
who is to blame for it.
* * Secondly, yet another little departure: I heard out both G.
, whom I met in the course of several days, and the other side.
You, on the other hand, heard out only the Unionists; but no more or less influential and authoritative representatives of the other side.
Hence, it seems to me that it is you, if anybody, who has violated the rule of “audiatur et altera pars” (“hear the other side as well”.
—Ed.
)Now passing to the heart of the matter.
Amalgamation is impossible.
So is federation, if the word is understood in its real sense, i.
e.
, a certain agreement, a treaty, mutual obligations, etc.
“The endeavour to afford each other as much help as possible”—is, I think, not bound up with federation, but is possible also without it, and is possible in general, al-though I do not know whether it is easily practicable.
If the Union sincerely desired this, it would hardly have started with ultimatums and the threat of a boycott (that was precisely the meaning of the words used by the person who delivered your letter); that cannot serve to improve relations.
We are an independent literary group.
We want to remain independent.
We do not consider it possible to carry on without such forces as Plekhanov and the Emancipation of Labour group, but no one is entitled to conclude from this that we shall forego even a particle of our independence.
That is all we can say at the moment to people who want to know above all what our attitude is to the Emancipation of Labour group.
To anyone who is not satisfied with this, we have nothing to say except: judge us by our deeds if you do not believe our words.
If, however, it is a question not of the present moment, but of the more or less near future, then, of course, we shall not refuse to impart to people with whom we shall have close relations more detailed information on the form of the relations between us and the Emancipation of Labour group.
You will ask: what kind of relations will you have with the Union? For the time being none, because it is our unal-terable decision to remain an independent group and enjoy the closest co-operation of the Emancipation of Labour group.
This decision, however, is distrusted by the Union, which fears that we will not be capable of sustaining our complete independence, that we will fall into an “impos-sible” (your expression) polemical tone.
If our activity dispels this distrust on the part of the Union, good relations can be established between us, otherwise they cannot.
Voilà tout.
You write: “The Union is looking to you”; but obvious-ly we can only help the Union with writings, and it is no less obvious that at the present time, when all our vital juices must go to nourish our coming offspring, 60 we cannot afford to feed other people’s children.
You write that 1) there are no disagreements in principle, and that 2) the Union is ready to prove in practice its de-termination to fight the “Economic trend”.
We are certain that on both these points you are mistaken.
Our conviction is based on such writings as, the postscript to the Anti-Credo,61 the reply to Vademecum.
62 No.
6 of Rabocheye Dyelo, 63 the preface to the pamphlet A Turning Point in the Jewish Labour Movement, and others.
We intend to come out in writing with a refutation of the opinion that there are no disagreements in principle (so that we shall have some relations with the Union: relations between parties engaged in a polemic).
Now for the last and main point: are we right or not in regarding you as having had “a very, very sharp change of views ” ? Let us recall how things stood in Russia: you knew that we wanted to found an independent literary en-terprise, you knew that we were for Plekhanov.
Consequent-ly, you knew everything, and not only did not refuse to participate, but, on the contrary, yourself used such an expression as “our” enterprise (do you remember our last talk in your flat en trois?), thus giving us grounds for expecting the closest participation from you.
Now, however, it turns out that you are silent on the question of your participation, that you set us the “task” of “settling the conflict abroad at all costs”, that is to say, a task which we have not undertaken and are not undertaking—without, of course, giving up the hope that our foundation of an independent enterprise with the co-operation of the Emancipation of Labour group may create a basis for settling the conflict.
Now, apparently, you doubt the expediency of our group establishing an independent enterprise, for you write that the existence of two organisations with “each leaving the other to act as the spirit moves it” will be bad for the cause.
It seems indubi-table to us that your views have undergone a sharp change.
We have now set before you with complete frankness how matters stand with us, and we should be very glad if our exchange of views on the question of “impending tasks” were not limited to this.
Address: Nürnberg, Ph.
Roegner.
First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original10 TO APOLLINARIA YAKUBOVA 64 October 26 I received your letter of October 24 yesterday and am replying at once as requested.
I cannot forward the letter just now, as I am not sending any pasted-in things to the address I have, and only use the chemical method.
I have no time to copy the letter by this means.
I wrote to the addressee 65 yesterday giving the substance of the letter, and I hope in the near future to communicate the whole letter to him.
But if you can copy it into an unbound book by the chemical method, then I will send it at once.
I will give my sister the address: she was not in Paris in September, so you could hardly have been there at the same time.
I hope you dropped her a few lines at the address I gave you.
Now, to business.
Your letter to me creates a strange impression.
Apart from information concerning addresses and forwarding, it con-tains nothing but reproaches—bare reproaches without any explanations.
You even go to the extent of attempting caustic remarks (“are you sure that you have done this for the benefit of the Russian workers’ movement and not for the benefit of Plekhanov?”)—but, of course, I am not going to exchange caustic remarks with you.
You reproach me for having “advised against”.
66 You quote me very inaccurately.
I remember very well that I did not express myself categorically, absolutely.
I wrote: “We find it hard at the moment to advise anything”; that is to say, I made our decision depend directly on a prelim-inary elucidation of the matter.
What this elucidationshould have been is clear from my letter: it was essential for us to be perfectly sure whether there had really been a “turn” in Rabochaya Mysl 67 (as we had been told and as we were entitled to conclude from the fact that you proposed to Plekhanov that he should participate) and what kind of turn.
On this basic and main question you do not say a word.
That we regard Rabochaya Mysl as an organ of a special trend with which we differ in the most serious way is something of which you have long been aware.
Some months ago both the addressee of your long letter and I flatly re-fused to take part in an organ of that trend, and obviously, in doing so ourselves, we could not but advise others to do the same.
The news of a “turn” in Rabochaya Mysl, however, put us in a “difficulty”.
A real turn could substantially alter the situation.
It is natural therefore that in my letter I expressed above all the desire to learn all the details of the turn—but you have not said a word in reply to this.
Perhaps, however, you consider that the answer to my question about the turn is contained in your letter to my friend 68 ? Perhaps, if you approached Plekhanov on behalf of the editorial board of Rabochaya Mysl, your letter to my friend could be regarded as an authentic expression of the board’s views? If so, then I am inclined to draw the conclusion that there has been no turn.
If I am mistaken, please explain my mistake to me.
The other day, another close supporter of Plekhanov wrote to me about the turn in Rabochaya Mysl.
But, being in correspondence with you, I cannot, of course, believe these “rumours” of a turn which are not in any way confirmed by you.
Again, I had better say openly and straightaway (even at the risk of incurring further reproaches) that, being in complete solidarity with my friend (to whom you write), I subscribe to his words: “We shall have to fight you”—if there is no turn.
But if there is—you must explain in full detail exactly what this turn is.
You write to my friend: “fight us, if you are not ashamed to do so”.
He will answer you himself, of course, but I for my part beg leave to reply to this.
I am not in the least ashamed to fight—seeing that things have gone so far thatthe disagreements have concerned fundamental issues, that an atmosphere has been created of mutual non-comprehen-sion, mutual distrust and complete discordance of views (I am not speaking of Rabochaya Mysl alone; I am speaking about everything I have seen and heard, and not so much here as at home), inasmuch as a number of “splits” has already arisen on this basis.
To get rid of this oppressive atmos-phere, even a furious thunderstorm, and not merely a liter-ary polemic, can (and should) be welcomed.
And there is no reason to be so much afraid of a struggle: a struggle may cause annoyance to some individuals, but it will clear the air, define attitudes in a precise and straight-forward manner, define which differences are important and which unimportant, define where people stand—those who are taking a completely different path and those Party com-rades who differ only on minor points.
You write that there have been mistakes in Rabochaya Mysl.
Of course, we all make mistakes.
Without a strug-gle, however, how is one to distinguish these minor mistakes from the trend which stands clearly revealed in Rabochaya Mysl and attains its culmination in the “Credo”.
* Without struggle there cannot be a sorting out, and without a sorting out there cannot be any successful advance, nor can there be any lasting unity.
And those who are beginning the struggle at the present time are by no means destroying * Note.
In your letter to my friend, for example, there is both misunderstanding and the Economic trend.
You are right in stressing that an economic struggle is necessary, that one must know how to make use of legal societies, that all kinds of responses and so forth are necessary, that one should not turn one’s back on society.
All that is legitimate and true.
And if you think that revolutionaries have a different view, that is a misunderstanding.
Revolutionaries say merely that every effort must be made to ensure that legal societies and so forth do not separate the workers’ movement from Social-Democracy and the revolutionary political struggle but, on the con-trary, unite them as closely and indissolubly as possible.
In your letter, however, there is no effort to combine, but there is an effort to separate, that is, there is Economism or “Bernsteinism”, 69 for example, in the statement: “The labour question in Russia, as it stands in reality, was first raised by Rabochaya Mysl”—in its arguments about the judicial struggle and so forth.
I apologise if my reference to your letter to my friend offends you; I wanted only to illustrate my thought.
unity.
There is no longer any unity, it has already been destroyed all along the line.
Russian Marxism and Russian Social-Democracy are already a house divided against it-self, and an open, frank struggle is one of the essential conditions for restoring unity.
Yes, restoring! The kind of “unity” that makes us con-ceal “Economic” documents from our comrades like a secret disease, that makes us resent the publication of statements revealing what views are being propagated under the guise of Social-Democratic views—such “unity” is not worth a brass farthing, such “unity” is sheer cant, it only aggravates the disease and makes it assume a chronic, malignant form.
That an open, frank and honest struggle will cure this disease and create a really united, vigorous and strong Social-Democratic movement—I do not for a moment doubt.
Perhaps it is very inappropriate that in a letter to you of all people I have to speak so often of a struggle (literary struggle).
But I think that our old friendship most of all makes complete frankness obligatory.
All the best.

V.
PLEKHANOV 70 January 30, 1901 I have received your letter just now, dear G.
V.
, imme-diately on my return from a “final” talk with Judas.
71 The matter has been settled and I am terribly displeased with the way in which it has been settled.
I hasten to write to you while my impressions are still fresh.
Judas did not argue about the “democratic opposition”; he is no romantic and not one to be frightened with words.
But, as far as “item 7” is concerned (the utilisation of ma-terial for Iskra, material reaching Sovremennoye Obozreniye), he outsmarted our people, all of whom, P.
B.
y compris, stood up for him, against me.
He, Judas—you see—expected that Iskra would be more popular, more “working-class”; he finds that our free use of material received by Sovremen-noye Obozreniye could create competition.
.
.
.
He demands that material for Iskra should be used only by agreement with the representative of Sovremennoye Obozreniye—agree-ment ceases to be necessary only if it is impossible to communicate with this representative, a condition that, obviously, will rarely operate, for Judas says frankly that he proposes either the existence of a representative im Auslande * (“not more than 12 hours from Munich”) or very punctual correspondence.
He would like to publish each month five sheets—that is to say, about 200,000 char-acters—just as much as in two sheets of Iskra.
That he will be able to supply so much material is hardly to be doubted, for he is well-to-do, writes a great deal and has good connections.
The thing is clear: the competition is * Abroad.
—Ed.
aimed not so much against Zarya 72 as against Iskra; the same preponderance of political material, the same news-paper character—review of current events, short articles (Judas with very true intuition attaches very great impor-tance to the frequent publication of booklets with smallish articles).
We shall be swamped with material of this kind, we shall be running around carrying out errands for Judas, who by his control of Sovremennoye Obozreniye (it is obvious that he will be master and complete master there for he has the money and 99 per cent of the materials—it is rarely, if ever, that we shall be in a position to give them even a very little) will make a magnificent liberal career and try to shoulder aside not only the heavyish Zarya, but Iskra as well.
We shall be running around, keeping ourselves busy with proof-reading and transportation, while His Highness Mr.
Judas will be rédacteur-en-chef of the most influential (in broad circles of so genannten* public opinion) little journal.
But “romantic” comfort can be offered these rechtgläubigen: let it be called “Supplement to the Social-Democratic journal Zarya”, let them console themselves with catchwords, but meanwhile I shall take the whole affair into my hands.
One is entitled to ask—will not the famous “hegemony” of Social-Democracy prove under the circumstances to be mere cant? In what will it find expres-sion other than in the catchword “Supplement to the So-cial-Democratic journal”? That he will overwhelm us with material is indubitable, for we can’t manage as it is to write enough both for Zarya and Iskra.

AXELROD March 20, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, I have received all your letters and have given Auntie news of her old friend.
73 There was no need for you to worry about addresses and to think that there had been any change.
I am still living at the same place and you should write to me at the old address: Herrn Georg Rittmeyer, Kaiserstrasse 53/0, München.
Inside: für Meyer.
I am not expecting my wife for some time yet: her term of exile only ends on Sunday, and she has to make some calls on the way, so she can hardly be here before the sec-ond half of April.
Even when she does come you can still write to Rittmeyer, 74 for he will always forward every-thing to me, and I in turn will let you know in good time of any change of address.
We are having trouble with Zarya.
That capricious gen-tleman Dietz 75 definitely rejected your editorial article; he was frightened by the references to Iskra, scented a whiff of “groups”, etc.
, and referred to the fact that both Bebel and Singer (shareholders in his G.
m.
b.
H.
) are rather afraid, 76 and so on.
To our very great regret, we had to give up your article, replacing it by a few words “to the readers”.
This new censorship is horribly unpleasant! The cover, too, has suffered: they deleted even “several Rus-sian Social-Democrats”.
When shall we get rid of the “tu-telage” of these Dreck-Genossen?! We are having unpleasantness with that Calf (Judas) too.
A very angry letter has come from his friend (= the proposed source of money= goldene Wanze 77 ), saying: I amsending 200 (two hundred!) rubles for Sovremennoye Oboz-reniye, and bear in mind, he says, that it is for this enter-prise and not for yours.
We are all indignant, and it has been decided: 1) not to publish the statement about the coalition, 2) to send the Calf and his “friend” an ultimatum: either firm financing of our enterprise or we refuse, 3) to finish the Witte memorandum.
78 Well, haven’t we been fooled again by Judas? There is one consolation: No.
2 of Iskra has reached Rus-sia safely.
It is a success and letters are pouring in.
The devil knows what is happening in Russia: demonstrations in St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Kharkov, Kazan; martial law in Moscow (by the way, they arrested my youngest sister there and even my brother-in-law, 79 who had never taken part in anything!); bloody battles; prisons crammed full, and so on.
In a few days we are expecting Brother 80 and our com-mon friend—Feld 81 —who have already left (at last!); the latter (so far) has safely fulfilled everything required of him.
We are publishing a May-Day leaflet, 82 and then we shall start on No.
3 of Iskra, and perhaps also No.
4 at the same time—there is a lot of material.
Zarya will come out on Saturday, they say, and will be sent to you directly from Stuttgart.
Our finances are in a very bad way.
Hence for the time being we must definitely refrain from all expenditure on inviting a man out (proposed by you as a carrier).
All the very best.

AXELROD March 25, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, I haven’t had a talk with you for a long time, I could not get down to it and, besides, Alexei has written to you about all business matters, * but the need of a talk has become too great for me to put it off any longer.
I should like to consult you about both the Parisians and Zurichers, 83 as well as about matters in general.
Do you know that the Parisians (long ago, about two or three weeks) have “dissolved the Iskra promotion group” and have refused (for the second time) to co-operate, on the grounds of our having “violated organisational neutral-ity” (sic! that we were unfair to the Union 84 and wrongly attacked it in Zarya).
This was written by the author of “Comments on the Programme of Rabocheye Dyelo”, 85 who hinted most unambiguously that Rabocheye Dyelo was on the mend (in Listok No.
6 86 it has even over-mended itself, in our opinion!) and consequently .
.
.
consequently .
.
.
Viv-rons verrons ** —this “dear comrade” concluded.
Obviously (like certain “young forces” about whom G.
V.
wrote), he is aiming at a better position in Rabocheye Dyelo.
The sheer scoundrelism of it made us so indignant that we did not even answer them.
In Iskra No.
4 (we have been promised that No.
3 will be ready by May 1 and intend to start on No.
4 immediately) we are going to flay Rabocheye Dyelo for its shilly-shallying.
I really don’t know whether to give these intrigants up * I have been ill here for a week with influenza.
** We shall wait and see.
—Ed.
as a bad job or to make yet another attempt.
They are, undoubtedly, capable people, they have written, they have (both of them) supplied material (Danevich as well), they have collected money skilfully (as much as 350 frs—no-where yet has so much been collected abroad for Iskra).
As a matter of fact, we are not blameless either in regard to them: we have not paid them sufficient attention, we have not sent a single article for examination and “com-radely advice”, we have not offered any “section” (if only a foreign review in Iskra or comments in a social chronicle on certain issues).
Apparently, under the conditions obtain-ing abroad, it is impossible, quite impossible, not to have something of the sort.
Now take the Berliners 87 (Arsenyev was there recently)—they too want a definite position; simply to help Iskra, they say, can satisfy a student, but we or Dvinskaya (she and her husband are withdrawing from the Union, in which, when the members were questioned, only three—Grishin 88 y compris!—expressed themselves in favour of the conference.
Vive camarade G.
!) require, they say, something of the sort, you know.
.
.
.
I just don’t know what to do! It is necessary to “invent” an organisation—without that es geht nicht.
* It has occurred to me that the following plan of organisa-tion could be tried: the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation, 89 the editorial board of Zarya and various groups (the Ber-liners, for example, the Parisians, perhaps, etc.
), or various persons, unite in a League, 90 let us say.
Literary activity to be handled in three ways: the Emancipation of Labour group has its print-shop, Zarya has its own, with an elected Literary Committee as closest collaborator, taking part in periodic joint editorial sessions and publishing (over the signature of the Literary Committee) pamphlets, etc.
, in the print-shops of Sotsial-Democrat and Zarya—eventuell also in a third print-shop should the League set one up (there is such a prospect).
The supreme decision on literary questions in the League will belong to a conference of three members: from the Emancipation of Labour group, from Zarya, and from the Literary Committee.
There will be a joint, elected management.
* There is nothing doing.
—Ed.
Such, in substance, is my plan (of course, Iskra, being a Russian publication, does not formally come into the League).
In principle this plan is approved here—by Elder Sister too.
I believe that such a “constitution” (“Aus-trian” Alexei jokingly calls it) holds no dangers for us, and something of the kind is absolutely necessary, otherwise there will be general dissatisfaction and we may lose all our people.
In this way we shall be fully guaranteed against dissensions and squabbles, keeping full control of our print-shops and editorial boards, while giving people the requi-site scope without which they will not agree to co-operate.
Please write what you think of this idea, and talk it over with G.
V.
(to whom I am not writing, for he should soon be here and will, of course, call on you on the way).
I am not going into details; they can be easily settled.
If we all (i.
e.
, the whole Sotsial-Demokrat) agree on this, the chances are that the Berliners (who have a print-shop and are eager to “work” from a definite “position”) will join us, and then we shall be able to counterpose to the Union a united “League” developing extensive activities.
There is no need to fear an elected management, for it will only control transport and the collection of money abroad, divided in a definite proportion between Sotsial-Demokrat, Zarya, etc.
, but it will not have anything to do with Iskra, which informally will be behind Zarya and together with Zarya.
Formally the League can be declared the ally abroad of the Iskra organisation in Russia, which we are already establishing.
Nor is there any need to fear literary stupidities, for (1) the Literary Committee can be bound by its Rules as far as independent publishing is concerned; (2) it will pub-lish over its own signature: the Emancipation of Labour group and Zarya will not be confused with it; (3) our peo-ple as well can be in it; (4) it will be subordinated to the conference, in which we have a majority.
I don’t know, of course, whether this will satisfy the Parisians—they are so proud.
We feel awkward about approaching them.
If you approve of the plan, would you care to write to them and throw out a feeler, seeing that they spoke to you earlier in Paris about their sad situation; you could now suggest this way out to them.
If you ap-prove of the idea, we shall get in touch with Koltsov and ask him to draft Rules for the League.
* Now about the Lettish Zurichers.
I don’t know whether you have heard that the transport arranged with their help came to grief: 3,000 copies of Iskra (No.
1) were seized by the police, who got hold of the smuggler as well.
Later one of them wrote to us, asking for more fare money.
We replied that we could not give any more for this route— we would not dare to put it before our organisation—but if he would undertake specially to get one pood across (as he undertook to do when he talked with me), then let him come and pick it up.
There was not a word in reply.
Do you know whether, perhaps, they have taken offence? What are they doing and planning? If you see any of them, please have a talk to find out how matters stand.
We are beginning to think about No.
2 of Zarya—it is time to do so.
The Witte memorandum will soon be fin-ished,** in about 2-3 weeks (for some reason Dietz is incredibly slow with it; so far only 9 sheets are ready).
So far we have no material apart from Nevzorov’s article on the historical preparation of Russian Social-Democracy which you already know about.
We are hoping for a leading article by G.
V.
on recent events, his article contra Struve, your article (from editorial comments)—that’s true, isn’t it?; an article by Luxemburg is promised (a new introduction to her articles “Die sozialistische Krise in Frankreich”, *** which articles we intend to translate), and Kautsky has promised an article on academicians and proletarians.
We have no foreign reviews.
How do matters stand with the “Austrian” article? Isn’t anything coming from Amer-ica?—and from Switzerland? It is said that Danevich is ill.
There is no one we can ask to write about Germany— apart from Parvus, who promised (?) a foreign review but that is not quite the thing.
* It would be good to come before our people with a joint draft of Sotsial-Demokrat and Zarya.
** “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Lib-eralism” (see present edition, Vol.
5).
—Ed.
*** “The Socialist Crisis in France.
”—Ed.
In the fourth issue of Iskra it is proposed to have an article on terrorism (by Alexei); there is: “The Autocracy and the Zemstvo” (continuation), “The Autocracy and Fi-nance” (by Parvus), something for the social chronicle (there is a supplement on demonstrations) and the working-class movement.
We are thinking of issuing No.
4 in a single sheet (No.
3 has expanded so much, to two sheets, 8 pages (seven pages are now ready), like No.
1—and part had to be left out.
)! We must exert every effort to expedite the publication of Iskra—to make it a monthly.

E.
BAUMAN 91 May 24, 1901 We received your letter with the report for January, February, March and April.
Thanks for the detailed and clear list of income and expenditure.
But as regards your activity in general, we are still unclear what exactly this activity is and what its results are.
You wrote that you have your hands full and there is no one to replace you, but you have still not kept your promise to describe this activity.
Is your work confined to forwarding literature to the points named in the report? Or are you engaged in forming a group or groups? If so, where and what kind, what has been done already, and what are these groups for—for local work, for sending to us for literature, or for something else? We ask about this because the question is very important.
Things with us are going none too well.
We are bad off financially, Russia gives almost nothing.
Shipping is still unorganised and haphazard.
Under these conditions, our “tactics” must aim wholly at 1) sending here the fullest possible amount of the money collected in Russia for Iskra, and reducing local expenditure to a minimum; 2) spending money almost exclusively on shipment, as we already have receiving agents functioning in Pskov and Poltava who are comparatively very cheap and no burden on our exchequer.
Please think this over carefully.
Our daily bread, by which we barely manage to keep alive, consists as before solely of suitcases.
For a couple of them we pay about a hundred rubles, and the chance nature of the persons sent entails a vast amount of delay, carelessness, loss, etc.
Noth-ing is being done to organise the sending of “suitcasers” from Riga (which, according to both Raznotsvetov andErnst, is possible).
There is no news from Leopold.
92 Noth-ing is being arranged in Finland, although this is also possible, as we are assured from various quarters.
Is it reasonable, in such a state of affairs, to spend 400 rubles in four months on local reception and intermediaries for forwarding literature? We think you should move into the immediate vicinity of the frontier for the sake of shipping at least 2-4 suit-cases and 10-20 pounds per month by personal handling.
What do you say to this? Sent from Munich to Moscow First published in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original15 TO P.

AXELROD May 25, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, You have already heard, of course, from G.
V.
of the plan for our organisation and of the new “conciliatory” enterprise of Nevzorov, Danevich and Ryazanov (who have taken the title of the Borba group 93 ).
We answered their inquiry (whether we agreed to a preliminary conference between Sotsial-Demokrat, the Union, and Zarya, i.
e.
, their representatives) by consenting.
G.
V.
said here that, of course, it was necessary to agree and that he had already written to you about it.
Today Ryazanov (who has already spent about two days here) told me that he had received a letter from Gurevich, who informed him that official agreement had been received only from us, that so far there was still nothing from the Emancipation of Labour group, that he had seen Krichevsky and Ivanshin and was almost sure of their agreement to the conference, that the place sug-gested is Brussels and the date about June 4, and that the Bund organisation abroad 94 also wished to attend the con-ference.
Please write to them as soon as possible about the official agreement to the conference on the part of the Emancipa-tion of Labour group (as the representative of Sotsial-Demokrat), and about your attitude to the question of place and time.
* On the first point we wrote that we are in favour of Zurich or some place closest to it (and that Switzerland, of course, is the most convenient place also for the Emancipation of Labour group) and that we should * I am repeating Gurevich’s address, just in case: Mr.
E.
Goure-vitsch, 38 bis Rue Gassendi, 38 bis Paris.
like the conference to be held quickly, if possible in May, for in June we have not so much free time at our disposal.
(Our desire to hasten the conference is really to be explained by the fact that it is more advantageous to us to get it over quickly so as to begin our own organisation sooner and have time for preparing for a decisive fight against the Union in the event of a break.
The fight, probably, will be shifted to Russia, too, in the summer.
) Please support our desire to hasten the conference * (putting forward any sort of grounds) and to hold it in Switzerland.
I think they can hardly object to Switzerland, firstly, because two of the four (Zarya and Sotsial-Demokrat against the Union and Borba) are in favour of Switzerland; secondly, Switzerland is bound to be the natural place for a congress of representatives of the Swiss, German and French groups.
Perhaps it would be possible to agree not on Zurich but on Basle, for instance? Let me know, please, when you send your official agreement.
I shall now tell you about Ryazanov.
On the question of our organisation (the Iskra organisation abroad) he at first got into a huff when he learnt that we had no intention of enlarging the editorial board and were proposing only a deliberative role for them.
He spoke with feeling about Nevzorov being a man who had a great past and services to his credit (exactly the way Nevzorov last summer spoke about Ryazanov!)—he expressed indignation, resorted to irony, and so on and so forth.
But a little later, seeing that all this hadn’t the slightest effect on us, he became disposed to make concessions.
He declared that he, perhaps, would agree to our plan (“Nevzorov would never agree”), but the best thing would be a federation between Sotsial-Demokrat, Zarya and Borba, that Borba was ready to give up the idea of publishing its own organ (we never believed they could set one up) and confine itself to a series of pamphlets.
On the whole, it looks as if it will be possible to work with them; they may jib a little, but will nevertheless join in.
As far as a rapprochement with the Union is concerned, Ryazanov at first stated that he did not put any hopes at * They are said to want it round about June 10.
We don’t mind.
all on the conference, that it was only Gurevich who enter-tained such an idea, and so forth.
But when he learnt that we were not making the abolition of the Union a conditio sine qua non, and that we were ready to allow the existence of a scientific organ (Zarya) and a political newspaper (Iskra) side by side with a popular miscellany or workers’ journal (Rabocheye Dyelo), he made a decisive change of front and declared that he had long ago spoken about this to Krichevsky, that he regarded it as the natural way of ending discord and that he himself was now ready to work for the realisation of such a plan.
Let him do some work! Perhaps amalgamation or federation on such a basis will really occur—it would be a big step forward.
Another reason why we are in favour of Zurich, I would add, is that Alexei is anxious to have more time to talk over all kinds of matters with you.
If the questioning of all members of Sotsial-Demokrat (for an official answer to the Borba group) requires much time, please try, if possible, to shorten this time somehow.
Delay in calling the conference is extremely undesirable.
Regarding participation of the Bund organisation abroad, we think it should be refused (without making a casus belli out of it in the last resort) on the grounds of paragraph 1 of the decisions of the Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in 1898.
(On the strength of this paragraph the Bund is autonomous only in questions specifically concerning the Jewish proletariat and, con-sequently, cannot act as an independent party to negotia-tions.
) How about your article for Iskra? Do you intend to pro-vide something for the second booklet of Zarya, about which G.
V.
, of course, has told you? With warmest greetings and best regards from all of us.
Yours, Petrov Sent from Munich to Zurich First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original16 TO LYDIA KNIPOVICH 95 How do you propose printing Iskra in Russia? At a secret printing-press or a legal one? If the latter, write immediately whether you have anything definite in view; we are ready to snatch at this plan with both hands (it is possible, we have been assured, in the Caucasus), and it would not require much money.
* If the former, bear in mind that in our printed sheet (4 pages) there are about 100,000 char-acters [and that each month!]; would a secret printing-press be able to cope with that? Will it not waste a vast amount of money and people with excessively great risk? Would it not be better to use this money and energy on shipments, which Russia, in any case, cannot do without.

9617 TO THE I S K R A 97 PROMOTION GROUP Doctor * should take up residence at the frontier, in Polangen for example (we have connections with the non-Russian side in those places, and we have also our own depot), study the local conditions (he would have to know Lettish and German there, but perhaps one could manage without that), try to find a plausible occupation (we are assured that it is possible to live there by private practice), establish good relations with the local petty officials and accustom them to frequent crossings of the frontier.
The frontier there is crossed not with a passport, but with a Grenzkarte ** (valid for 28 days).
With such frequent cross-ings it will be possible to carry across (on one’s person or in a suitcase by our method, which requires a small case for medical instruments) a little at a time, some pounds of literature on each occasion.
It is very important for us that the crossings should be regular and frequent, even if with very little at a time.
If the person will undertake to arrange this and do the work himself, we will give him the fare money and a couple of months’ living expenses, until he settles down.

As regards arrangements for printing Iskra in the Cau-casus, we have already sent X a detailed inquiry but have not yet had an answer.

Make every effort to obtain money.

BAUMAN To Rook We have just received news from Nikolai (= Ernst) of the shipment to him of 42 poods, which he has in a safe place; that is the first thing.
The second is that he always has an opportunity of getting our man together with the smuggler across the frontier and that such people are need-ed.
So we make the following proposal to you: take a trip to the spot at once, travel with one of your passports to Nikolai in Memel, find out about everything from him, then cross the frontier by Grenzkarte or with a smuggler, pick up the literature lying on this side (i.
e.
, in Russia) and deliver it everywhere.
It is obvious that for success in this matter it is essential to have one more person from the Russian side to help Nikolai and exercise control over him, someone always ready to cross the frontier secretly, but chiefly occupied with receiving literature on the Rus-sian side and forwarding it to Pskov, Smolensk, Vilna, Poltava.
[We have lost faith altogether in Nikolai and his Co.
; we have decided not to give them another farthing and we can hope to use this route only on condition that a wholly reliable man of ours takes a direct part in the shipments.
] You would be a suitable man for this, for (1) you have already visited Nikolai once, and (2) you have two passports.
It is a difficult and serious matter, requiring changes of residence, but it is also most important for us.
Think it over carefully and reply immediately, without putting it off for a single day.
If you are not prepared to undertake this job, we must find someone else for it imme-diately.

PLEKHANOV July 7, 1901 Dear G.
V.
, How is your work going? All this time I have been want-ing to write you about the ending to Orthodox’s article, i.
e.
, the later addendum concerning Berdayev’s article 100 in No.
6 of Mir Bozhy.
Our Struvefreundliche Partei 101 rejected this ending by a majority of 2 w votes against 1 4 (Alexei “divided himself” into w and 4 )—I was left in the minority with my “in favour”.
They didn’t like the note on romantic love either, nor the general character of the addendum.
In my opinion, however, it gave a brief, sharp, clear and business-like rebuff to the gentleman in question; the concluding verses are especially good! We are again told in letters from Russia that there is to be a congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party—in one town even an invitation has been received.
It is extremely important to make haste with the programme.
Write, please, whether you are thinking of undertak-ing and can undertake this work.
Apart from you and P.
B.
there is really no one: the formulation requires inten-sive thinking out, but with the bustle existing here, for example, it is quite impossible to concentrate and give proper thought to it.
Those old drafts of the programme and the article (that is, one draft and one article) which Alexei brought you—and which he quite wrongly took back—are hardly likely to be of much use, are they? What do you think? If, however, you need them, we shall imme-diately send them to you.
I have ordered Shakhovskoi and Tezyakov.
102 Why do you need them for the programme? You are not thinking of drawing up demands for the agricultural workers on the basis of them, are you? And what is your attitude to demandsfor the peasantry? Do you in general accept the possibility of such demands in the Russian Social-Democratic pro-gramme? The proofs of your article have not yet come.

I shall write, too, against Chernov.

He is going on holiday and does not promise to write anything just now; Nevzorov has sent Iskra a “disgusting” (the comment of V.
I.
and Puttman) article against the article “Where To Begin” 104 —a hymn to the committees, a defence (eva-sive) of Rabocheye Dyelo, etc.
We shall return it to the author (we shall make a copy and send it to you, if you like).

TSEDERBAUM 105 We have just received a letter with the plan of Pakhomy’s Brother, Yablochkov and Bruskov.
We cannot conceal that not only are we unable to agree with any part of this plan (though the first part is perhaps debatable), but we were simply astonished by it, especially by the second part, namely: 1) that everyone move to St.
Petersburg, 2) that a regional organ of the Iskra organisation in Russia be established.
So astonished that we apologise beforehand for any too sharp word that may slip into our comments.
It is unbelievable! After a whole year of desperate efforts we have barely succeeded in starting to form a staff of lead-ers and organisers in Russia for this vast and most urgent task (this staff is still terribly small, for we have only 2-3 persons in addition to the three mentioned above, whereas an all-Russia organ requires more than one dozen such ener-getic collaborators, taking this word not merely in a literary sense), and suddenly the edifice is to be dismantled again and we are to return to the old primitive methods! I cannot imagine more suicidal tactics for Iskra! A regional organ like the existing Yuzhny Rabochy 106 means a mass of money and personnel expended all over again on editorial offices, technical facilities, delivery arrangements, etc.
, and for the sake of what? For the sake of five issues in eighteen months! Even this it will not be able to do now in eighteen months, for Yuzhny Rabochy had the advantage of being founded by a full-formed Committee, i.
e.
, by a whole or-ganisation at the apogee of its development.
At present there are only three of you.
If, instead of combating the narrowness which makes the St.
Petersburger forget about Moscow, the Muscovite about St.
Petersburg, the Kievman about everything except Kiev, if instead of training people to handle all-Russia affairs (it takes years to train them for this, if we want to build a political party worthy of the name), if, instead of this, we shall again encourage primitive methods, local narrowness and the development of a Gothamite instead of an all-Russia Social-Democracy, it will be nothing but Gothamite foolishness, it cannot be anything else.
It has been found out by experience how unequipped we are for creating a really political organ, how few contributors and reporters we have, how few people with political connections, how few practical workers to handle technical jobs and distribution.
Russia has few of them, as it is, without our splintering them still further and dropping an all-Russia undertaking that has already been launched and which needs all-round support, for the sake of founding a new local enterprise.
At best, in the event of this new plan being a shining suc-cess, it will lower the standard of Russian Social-Democracy, lower its political significance, because there cannot be a “local” political newspaper, since in a local organ the general-political section is always bound to suffer.
You write: a “mass” organ.
We totally fail to understand what kind of animal this is.
Do you mean to say that Pakhomy’s Brother, too, has begun to think that we must descend to a lower level; from the advanced workers to the mass, that we must write more simply and closer to life? Do you mean to say our aim is to descend closer to the “mass” instead of raising this already stirring mass to the level of an organised political movement? Is it letters from factories and workshops that we lack, and not political exposures, political knowledge and political generalisations? And in order to extend and deepen our political generalisations we are invited to fragment our work as a whole into regional undertakings! And besides depreciating the cause politi-cally they will inevitably depreciate it technically by the plan for a regional organ.
By combining all forces on Iskra, we can set up a monthly newspaper (this has now been proved after a year’s experience) with really political mater-ial, but in the case of a regional organ it is impossible just now to think even of four issues per annum.
If we don’t skip impatiently from one plan to another, and are not putout by temporary setbacks and the slow growth of an all-Russia undertaking, it would be quite possible after six months or a year to achieve a fortnightly organ (which is persistently in our thoughts).
We assume, of course, that Pakhomy’s Brother, Yablochkov and Bruskov stand by the previous line, approving both the political trend and the organisational plan of Iskra, but if they have altered their views on these matters, that is quite a different question, of course.
We are quite at a loss to understand why these people have lost confidence in this plan, and so quickly too (because they cannot fail to see that the new plan de-stroys the old one).
Is it because of shipments? So far we have attempted only once to arrange a route and this at-tempt has not yet led to a complete failure—and even after two or three failures we ought not to throw up the sponge.
Have not these people begun to sympathise with publica-tion in Russia, rather than abroad? Surely they know that everything was done for the former and about 1,000 rubles spent, but so far without result.
We must say that in general we consider that any plan for publishing any sort of regional or local organ of the Iskra organisation in Russia is decid-edly incorrect and harmful.
The Iskra organisation exists to support and develop the paper, and to unite the Party through it, and not for a dispersion of our forces, of which there is more than enough without this organisation.
As for everyone going to St.
Petersburg, we can only say that we have very few Party workers like P.
, B.
and Pakhomy’s Brother and we need to preserve them.
Living in one place, the danger of a general roundup is a hundred times greater.
If they find that one person there is not enough (it’s for them to decide), let them add to him the one who is being released in the autumn (Pakhomy’s Brother), but not both.
And then, for the sake of both security and united work, let them not forget that it is extremely desirable to change their place of residence from time to time.
If, finally, suc-cess were achieved in winning over the Committee in St.
Petersburg, it should, of course, be made to devote itself heart and soul to Iskra and its more frequent publication, and to oppose all new primitive undertakings.
Primitivism is a much more dangerous enemy than Economism, for vital roots of Economism, we are profoundly convinced,are deeply buried in primitivism.
And there will never be any political movement (political not in words only, but in fact, i.
e.
, one directly influencing the government and preparing a general assault) until we overcome this primitivism and eradicate all belief in it.
If St.
Petersburg has bought 400 copies of Yuzhny Rabochy, the Sotsialist 107 group has set about distributing 1,000 copies of Iskra Let them organise the distribution of this number of copies; let them arrange for it to contain a detailed St.
Petersburg section (if necessary, it will be a special supplement), and then there will have been accomplished the very task that has overshadowed for you all other tasks of winning over St.
Petersburg.
Let us remind you that all “practical work-ers” are agreed that Yuzhny Rabochy has no advantages over Iskra as regards accessibility to workers, so that this argument, too, falls to the ground.
It is absurd and crim-inal to disperse forces and funds—Iskra has no money, not a single Russian agent is obtaining a farthing for it, and yet everyone is thinking up some new undertaking requiring new funds.
All this shows a lack of self-discipline We must be more patient; by means of our plan we shall achieve our ends, albeit not so soon, whereas what can be reckoned on by implementing the proposed plan is clear from the lamentable experience of Rabocheye Znamya.
108 Our friends began to carry out their plan in such haste that Yablochkov travelled to St.
Petersburg in defiance of the condition laid down, abandoning Odessa, in which the presence of our agent was essential.
We demand that the new plan be discarded.
If our arguments are thought unconvincing, let all new plans be put off until our con-gress, which we shall convene, if necessary, when the thing has been got going.
As far as popular literature is con-cerned, the idea is to extend the publication of popular pamphlets.
This letter expresses the opinion not only of our group but also of the Emancipation of Labour group.

PLEKHANOV July 25, 1901 Dear G.
V.
, Yesterday I received the books on the agrarian question, Thank you for them.
I am pretty deeply immersed in my “agrarian” article against Chernov (and partly Hertz and Bulgakov).
I think this Chernov needs to be trounced unmercifully.
* Velika was here just now and read extracts from your letter to her.
As regards the proofs, we have already done “everything in our power”, i.
e.
, we have sent Dietz cor-rections to be inserted in the text if it is not too late; if it is, we shall specify them without fail at the end of the book so that there will be no great harm done really.
My wife read the proofs and compared them with the manu-script (the phrase on which you have made the marginal note, “I didn’t have that!” proved to be a slip of the pen on your part.
As I have just seen from the manuscript, you actually did write “the May uprising”.
We have corrected this too).
Since proof-reader mistakes are unavoidable, we shall from now on apply the “tactics” proposed by you: we shall send the author the first proofs (the second will be too late), for him to correct not individual letters and characters, since that will be done by the proof-reader and is indeed not important, but only places where the sense is distorted by the omission of words and phrases or by the replacement of one word by another.
* See “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (present edition, Vol.
5).
—Ed.
I received my article * from P.
B.
with his letter.
P.
B.
is also in favour of toning it down.
Needless to say, I have already introduced all the mitigations concretely indicated by you and P.
B.
As regards changing the whole tone of the article, or replacing all attacks by tongue-in-cheek edification, although I like this plan of yours, I doubt whether I could do it.
If I didn’t feel any “irritation” against the author I would not have written like that.
But since there is “irritation” (understandable not only to us but to every Social-Democratic reader of the preface), I am no longer able to conceal it, and cannot exercise cunning here.
I shall try to tone it down still more and make still further reservations; perhaps something will come of it.
I shall pass on to Alexei your comments on his essay (he has long been looking forward to them).
He probably forgot to tell you that he himself passed his subject about Mikhai-lovsky on to Ryazanov (the latter is now writing it).
I understood that you were writing a review of At the Post of Honour, which we sent you.
All the very best.
Yours.
.
.

If you see Koltsov, give him many thanks from me for Volnoye Slovo.
109 O yes, I almost forgot.
I should like to ask your advice on the following question.
This same swine Chernov quotes F.
Engels’s article “The German Peasant” in Russkoye Bogatstvo, 1900, No.
1, where at the end Engels says that it is necessary to “restore the Mark”.
I found this article.
It turned out to be a translation of the Anhang to the Ent-wicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft— “Die Mark”; moreover in “Russkoye Bogatstvo” at the end two paragraphs (18 lines) have been inserted which are absent in the original.
I compared all the rest of the translation paragraph by paragraph, but the devil knows where these two paragraphs have come from.
This outrage ought to be exposed, only—isn’t there a misunderstanding here * “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Libe-ralism” (see present edition, Vol.
5).
—Ed.
perhaps? Isn’t there another text of this article by Engels? In a note to the Russian translation, the editors of Rus-skoye Bogatstvo say: “This article of his (Engels) appeared in the eighties [in 1882? the preface to Entwicklung is marked September 21, 1882] in a German magazine [? Neue Zeit? or Zuricher Sozialdemokrat? 110 Do you know?] without his signature [?].
But in a copy of it, which Engels sent to one of his friends [sic! Danielson? Did you hear anything about this from Engels?] he signed it with his initials.
” In addition, it is said, the historical part of the article is identical with the preface to “Schlesische Milliarde” and with an article in Neue Rheinische Zeitung111 (April-March 1849).
Could you help me to get to the bottom of this? Wasn’t there another text of the article “Die Mark” in Neue Rhei-nische Zeitung or elsewhere? Could Engels later have thrown out the end about “the restoration of the Mark”? Sent from Munich to Geneva First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original23 TO P.

AXELROD July 26, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, I have received and carefully read your letter (so has Alexei).
I was very glad that you set out your remarks in such detail.
112 Only you are wrong in thinking that I am too (“pretty”) “stubborn” .
I have accepted all your sug-gestions about toning down definite passages (as well as all suggestions of G.
V.
), that is, I have toned it down every-where.
“A kopek on the ruble” will unite all the workers: I have added “in the opinion of the Economists” in brackets.
Instead of “restriction of the autocracy” I have put “de-struction”, as you suggested.
On pp.
82-83 I have deleted altogether what was incautious in the sense of our views on utilising the liberals (i.
e.
, incautiously expressed ideas), as you advised.
I have also inserted a note with a reference to your pamphlet The Historical Situation, pointing out that the question only slightly touched upon by me has been analysed in detail by you.
I have inserted a couple of words to the effect that one can be glad of the greater understanding of the workers’ movement shown by the liberals (in the person of R.
N.
S.
).
I have deleted altogether “regret” at the publication of the Witte memorandum with such a preface.
I have also deleted some sharp remarks in the first and the second half of the article.
In general, I am not at all so stubborn about toning down specific remarks, but as a matter of principle I cannot give up the idea that it is our right (and our duty) to trounce R.
N.
S.
for his political juggling.
He is precisely a political jug-gler—reading and re-reading the preface has definitely con-vinced me of this, and in my criticism I brought in every-thing that the last few months have shown us (i.
e.
, Verhand-lungen * with “Calf”, attempts at an agreement, etc.
** I got a weight off my chest, so to speak, in settling accounts with this individual.
I regarded elucidation of the consti-tutional nature of the Zemstvo as the crux of the whole article.
Zemstvo liberalism is, in the sphere of its influence on society, the same thing as Economism in the sphere of the latter’s influence on the workers.
We must attack the narrowness of both the one and the other.
Tomorrow, probably, the question of the article will be decided here.
If it goes to press now, I shall try to send you a copy of the first proof; you may have further sugges-tions, and we can still manage to touch it up (while the first and second proofs are being corrected).
I send you warm greetings and wishes for a good rest and recuperation.
For this it would be best, perhaps, not to send you anything for the time being? So as not to spoil your holiday and treatment? Yours, Petrov Write to Herrn Dr.

I did not get Tezyakov 113 ; probably it won’t come at all, as it was ordered from Kalmykova’s store 114 and she is being exiled from St.
Petersburg for three years and is clos-ing down the store (the latest and quite accurate news!).
I am sending you Kuleman 115 today.
As regards the forgery in Russkoye Bogatstvo concerning Engels, * I shall take all possible steps.
As regards reviews, we have little definite information.
All are busy with their own articles (Velika—against Ber-dayev, Puttman with magazine notes= against Russkoye Bogatstvo, I with my agrarian article, ** etc.
).
Moreover, there is still time for reviews.
I have sent my article against R.

There, too, I am toning down a few expressions (on Velika’s insistence).

V.

We are planning to print your article in Iskra No.
10.
No.
9 will come out in a few days; the delay is due to its having swelled to eight pages.
Did you receive Nos.
1 and 3 of Neue Zeit (when you have finished with them, please return them)? I sent them to you because they contain articles by Engels and Kautsky on the programme, 119 which may, perhaps, be of use to you.
When do you expect to finish the programme? You do not write anything about the review of the col-lected writings of Marx.
120 We take it that you will send it all the same—it is absolutely necessary for Zarya No.

Volume 4 will be published on November 4, containing letters of Lassalle to Marx, but it is not worth while writ-ing a review of it now, so as not to delay publication.

I ask about the programme so insistently because we have to know whether, immediately after Zarya No.
2-3 has come out, there will be material for No.
4 to be given to the compositors.
Dietz is pressing me about this.
If Ryazanov’s article has not yet been sent—send it immediately, otherwise he will positively tear Alexei to pieces.
Ryazanov (and Parvus with him) has been mortally offended by the postponement of his article and wants, it seems, to take leave of us.
“You don’t know your job as editors!”, Parvus said to us.
How do you like that? Written November 2, 1 9 0 1 Sent from Munich to Geneva First published in 1 9 2 6 Printed from the original27 TO THE I S K R A ORGANISATIONS IN RUSSIA 1) Yakov 2) The Moscow Committee 3) St.
Petersburg & Nizhni 4) Bakunin? 5) “A Letter to the Russian Social-Democratic Press”.
122 We have just learnt that the Unionists are arranging a conference of the leading committees to decide the ques-tion of the conflict abroad.
123 Every effort must be made to secure the adoption of the following measures by the largest possible number of com-mittees and groups: 1) The conference must unfailingly be postponed at least until the spring (until Easter or thereabouts).
Reasons: a) It is essential to have delegates both from Iskra and from the League abroad, and this requires time and money.
A conference without delegates from Iskra and the League is invalid and senseless.
b) It is essential to wait for the publication of the pamphlets of both sides giving the gist of the disagreements.
Until these pamphlets come out the conference cannot have the knowledge needed for judge-ment and so its deliberations would be hanging in the air.
Iskra No.
12 (appearing December 5, 1901) definitely prom-ises that this pamphlet will be issued very shortly (in about a month and a half).
All the disagreements will be analysed there in great detail.
We shall show there how pernicious the Rabocheye Dyelo trend is, and reveal all their dis-graceful vacillation and impotence in the face of Bern-steinism and Economism.
This pamphlet is nearly ready and is rapidly approaching completion.
Further, at the present time (mid-December, new style) reports on thedisagreements are being delivered abroad: one by a repre-sentative of Rabocheye Dyelo, another by a representative of the League.
These reports too will very soon appear in print, and to call a conference before they appear is just a waste of money and a needless sacrifice.
2) We shall send a special representative to the confer-ence, if it does take place.
Hence it is imperative that we should be informed immediately (1) whether the conference has been fixed; (2) where; (3) when; and (4) the pass-word and rendezvous for the conference.
The committees and groups must be formally requested to communicate this information on pain of the conference being declared in-valid and of immediate publication of the fact that there is a desire to decide matters without having heard both sides.
3) If the committees or groups elect to the conference representatives with a bias in favour of Rabocheye Dyelo, it is essential to protest against this immediately and for-mally, and to demand representatives from both Rabocheye Dyelo and Iskra supporters (from the Majority and the Minority respectively).
4) In the event of the conference declaring against Iskra, it will be necessary to withdraw from committees and groups which do not agree to protest publicly against this—to withdraw and at once publish the fact in Iskra and give the reasons for it.
Our people must begin right now to make arrangements for such a step.
5) We must be informed at once of the result, and kept informed immediately of all steps taken.
Every effort should be made to ensure that Iskra supporters everywhere reach agreement and act in unison.
Written prior to December 1 8 , 1 9 0 1 in Munich First published in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original28 TO INNA SMIDOVICH 124 We have received information that Akim is printing Vperyod.
125 We refuse to believe it and request you to ascertain whether this is not a misunderstanding.
That people who have been collecting hundreds and thousands of rubles on behalf of Iskra, for the Iskra print-shop— people who represent the Iskra organisation in Russia— should go over secretly to another undertaking and that at a critical moment for us, when shipments have come to a stand, when the entire North and Centre (and the South tool) have flooded us with complaints at the absence of Iskra, and when the only hope was to have it reproduced in Russia, that people should have done this in such an underhand way, for Akim wrote us that he was printing No.
10 and we were so sure of it, while Handsome did not tell us a word about his magnificent plans—such behaviour, which violates not only all rules of the organisation, but also certain simpler rules, is simply unbelievable.
If this incredible news is true, we demand an immediate meeting to deal with this unprecedented depravity and, for our part, we earnestly request Yakov and Orsha to scrape together whatever money they can and immediately carry out their plan of coming here.

GOLDMAN 126 Do you consider it essential that the existence of an Iskra print-shop in Russia be kept secret? That is to say: are you against our widely showing the Russian copy abroad? 127 As regards the general maladjustment of our affairs, of which, according to the person who has recently seen you, 128 you so bitterly complain, we can be of little assistance.
The Russian members of the Iskra organisation should form a solid core and achieve a proper distribution of Iskra throughout Russia.
That is wholly a matter for the Russian organisation.
If we achieve it, success is assured.
But without it, maladjustment is inevitable.
* For the sake of proper distribution and prestige it would be extremely important to print Iskra in Russia, every third or fourth issue, choosing one of more permanent interest.
Perhaps No.
13, 129 for example, should be chosen.
But once you do print, print a much larger number of copies; we should try at least once to satiate the whole of Russia.

Regarding religion, in a letter of Karl Marx on the Gotha Programme I read a sharp criticism of the demand for Gewissensfreiheit * and a statement that Social-Democrats ought to speak out plainly about their fight against reli-giösem Spuk.
** 130 Do you consider such a thing possible and in what form? In the matter of religion we are less concerned about cautiousness than the Germans, as is the case, too, in regard to the “republic”.
Will you please let Koltsov copy from your copy; it will not take much time.
How is your work going (if you are writing an article for Zarya, as we assume)? When do you think you will finish it? You have still not sent me Neue Zeit (Nos.

* When you have read it, please send it to P.
B.
together with this letter, for if you keep to the plan which I originally supported (viz.
, that this article should be, so to speak, a general defence of our general draft), we must agree joint-ly on any necessary corrections.
If, however, you reject this plan, then we shall have to make other arrangements.
In some places I have quoted the general part of the pro-gramme (the statement of principle) according to my draft; this will be altered, of course, if my draft is rejected.
(I could then make some quotations from the Erfurt Program-me, 133 if you had no objections.
) Velika Dmitrievna made some marginal comments with-out, however, suggesting definite changes in each particular case.
Please write and give me your opinion on these points.
On one of them, I should like to say a few words in my own defence.
Velika Dmitrievna suggests deleting pages 79-82 ** ; I, of course, would not go out of my way to defend them.
But she has also discovered in them the programme’s “encouragement of unfairness” in proposing not to give preference to small leaseholders (of nationalised land) but leasing to big and small alike on condition of fulfilment of the agrarian laws and (N.
B.
) proper cultivation of the land and livestock management.

6).
—Ed.
** This refers to the MS.
of “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” (see present edition, Vol.

140-42).
—Ed.
She argues: this will be a “crime”, for “the rich will grab everything”, while improved cultivation will deprive of work nine-tenths of the workers whom no agrarian laws will help.
I think this argument is incorrect, for (1) it presumes a very highly developed bourgeois society in which it is a rare peasant who can manage without wage-labour; (2) the “rich” can then obtain land only if large-scale farm-ing is technically and economically “well organised”, but this cannot be done all at once, hence the sudden transition that frightens Velika Dmitrievna cannot happen; (3) the ousting of workers by machines is, of course, the inevitable result of large-scale production, but we are pinning our hopes not on retarding the development of capitalist contra-dictions, but on their full development; moreover, improved cultivation of the soil presupposes a gigantic growth of industry and intensified efflux of population from the land; (4) the proposed measure will not only not help any “crim-inals” but, on the contrary, is the sole conceivable measure in bourgeois society for counteracting “crime”, for it directly restricts not only exploitation of the worker, but also plunder of the land and deterioration of livestock.
It is precisely the petty producer in bourgeois society who especially squanders the forces not only of people, but of the land and livestock.

Wood, apparently, has been taken.
It is essential that Claire should save himself and therefore should go underground without delay.
The meet-ing with Sasha 138 (Wood managed to write to us about it) led to the appointment of a committee for convening a congress in five months’ time.
Our main task now is to prepare for it, i.
e.
, to ensure that our own reliable people penetrate into the largest possible number of committees and try to undermine the Southern Central Committee of the southern committees (= whirligig).
This “whirligig”, which is manipulated by a Genosse (someone has even accused him of being an agent provocateur, but that has not been verified yet), is the main obstacle (besides St.
Petersburg).
Hence the immediate task—that both Kurtz and Embryon join the committees at once.
Next, that their example in one form or another is followed by Claire and Brodyagin.
This is the main task, for otherwise we shall inevitably be ousted; subordinate everything else to this task, bear in mind the major sig-nificance of the Second Congress! Adapt .

Look after yourself as you would the apple of your eye—for the sake of the “main task”.
139 If we (i.

Forward this letter to Brodyagin immediately and tell him to write to us without fail and more frequently; all his letters have arrived safely.
If it is confirmed that Wood has gone under, we must meet Claire or Brodyagin as soon as possible or correspond in great detail, if there are good addresses (?) for sending you all the details about Sasha (send an address for the bookbinding as quickly as possible).
Arrange the passport yourself, do not rely on us.
Shouldn’t Claire and Brodyagin change passports, since the former is already known to everyone? Who will be the delegate from Moscow? Is he absolutely reliable? Has he a good successor? And so: again and again: join the committees.

I shall be very glad, when we meet, to have a talk with you about the beginning of the “affair” in Munich, 140 not, of course, to rehash the past, but to discover for myself what it was that offended you at the time.

V.

Personally, I am inclined to consider such a decision the best and I think that the possibility of registering a 25 per cent differ-ence (if it has to be registered at all) has always existed for each of the co-editors (just as you have already men-tioned a somewhat different formulation of the question of nationalisation in the same article—or of the liberals in the review in Zarya No.

I am ready now, of course, to discuss with you once again desirable alterations in my article * and I shall send you the proofs for this purpose.

SMIDOVICH 144 August 2, 1902 Dear Ch.
, I received your letter, and I reply, to start with, in a couple of words: I don’t feel at all well, I am all done up.
On the point you have raised, I have not seen a single letter.
I think you are under a misapprehension.
Who could think of “unorganising” the workers’ circles, groups and organisations instead of increasing and strengthening them? You write that I have not indicated how a strictly secret organisation can have contact with the mass of workers.
That is hardly the case, for (although that is vient sans dire) you yourself quote the passage on p.
96 concerning the need “in as large a number as possible (Lenin’s italics) and with the widest variety of functions” for “a large number (N.
B.
!) [a large number!!] of other organisations” (i.
e.
, besides the central organisation of professional revo-lutionaries).
* But you are wrong in finding an absolute antithesis where I have merely established a gradation and marked the limits of the extreme links of this gradation.
For a whole chain of links occurs, beginning from the handful making up the highly secret and close-knit core of professional revolutionaries (the centre) and ending with the mass “organisation without members”.
I point out merely the trend in the changing character of the links: the greater the “mass” character of the organisation, the less definitely organised and the less secret should it be—that is my thesis.
And you want to understand this as meaning that there is no need for intermediaries between the mass and the revolutionaries! Why, the whole essence lies in these inter-mediaries! And since I point out the characteristics of the extreme links and stress (and I do stress) the need for in-termediate links, it is obvious that the latter will have their place between the “organisation of revolutionaries” * What Is To Be Done? (See present edition, Vol.
5, p.
466).
—Ed.
and the “mass organisation”—between as regards the type of their structure, i.
e.
, they will be less narrow and less secret than the centre, but more so than a “weavers’ union”, and so forth.
In a “factory circle” (needless to say, we must aim at having a circle of intermediaries in each factory), for example, it is essential to find a “middle” course: on the one hand, the whole, or almost the whole, factory must inevitably know such and such a leading worker, trust him and obey him; on the other hand, the “circle” should arrange things so that all its members cannot be identified, so that the one in closest contact with the mass cannot be caught red-handed, cannot be exposed at all.
Doesn’t that follow logically from what is said in Lenin’s book? The ideal of a “factory circle” is quite clear: four or five (I am speaking by way of example) revolutionary work-ers—they must not all be known to the mass.
One member, probably, must be known, and he needs to be protected from exposure; let it be said of him: he is one of us, a clever chap, although he does not take part in the revolution (not visibly).
One member maintains contact with the centre.
Each of them has an alternate member.
They conduct several circles (trade-union, educational, distribution, spy-catching, arming, etc.
, etc.
), the degree of secrecy, natu-rally, of a circle for catching spies, for example, or for procuring arms, being quite different from that of one devoted to the reading of Iskra or the reading of legal literature, and so on and so forth.
The degree of secrecy will be inversely proportional to the number of members of the circle and directly proportional to the remoteness of the circle’s aims from the immediate struggle.
I do not know whether it is worth while writing specially about this: if you think it is, return this letter to me to-gether with yours, as material, and I shall think it over.
I hope to meet the St.
Petersburg comrade here and talk things over with him in detail.

NOSKOV 145 August 4, 1902 Dear B.
N.
, I received both your letters and was very glad to see from them that the imaginary “misunderstandings” are really just smoke, as I already said in writing to Cook (I wrote that I was convinced of this).
You complain of our “agents”.
I want to talk this over with you—it is such a painful subject with me too.
“Agents have been recruited too lightly.
” I know it, I know it only too well, I never forget it, but that is just the tragedy of our situation (believe me, tragedy is none too strong a word!)—that we are obliged to act in this way, that we are powerless to overcome the lack of management prevailing in our affairs.
I am well aware that your words contained no reproach to us.
But try to put yourself in our place and adopt such an attitude as to make you say not “your agents” but “our agents”.
You could, and in my opinion should, adopt such an attitude—and only then will all possibility of misunderstandings have been removed once for all.
Substitute the first person for the second, keep an eye yourself on “our” agents, help to search for, change and replace them, and then you will speak not of our agents being “unpleasant” (such language is bound to be misunder-stood: it is regarded as an expression of estrangement, it is regarded as such in general and by the members of our editorial collegium who have not had an opportunity of clearing up the question with you), but of the shortcomings of our common cause.
The mass of these shortcomings weighs more and more heavily upon my mind as time goes on.
The time is now fast approaching (I feel it) when the ques-tion will face us squarely: either Russia will appoint itspeople, put forward people who will come to our aid and set matters right, or.
.
.
.
And although I know and see that such people are being put forward and that their number is growing, this is taking place so slowly and with such interruptions, and the “creaking” of the machinery is so nerve-racking, that .
.
.
sometimes it becomes extremely painful.
“Agents have been recruited too lightly.
” Yes, but after all we don’t make the “human material”, we take and have to take what we are given.
We couldn’t live without it.
A man is going to Russia—“I want to work for Iskra,” he says.
He is an honest man, devoted to the cause.
Well, he goes, of course, and passes for an “agent”, although none of us had ever handed out such a title.
And what means have we for checking “agents”, guiding them or appointing them to other places? More often than not we can’t even get letters, and in nine cases out of ten (I speak from experience) all our plans in regard to the future activ-ity of the “agent” end in smoke as soon as the frontier is crossed, and the agent muddles along just anyhow.
Believe me, I am literally losing all faith in routes, plans, etc.
, made here, because I know beforehand that nothing will come of it all.
We “have to” make frantic efforts doing (for lack of suitable people) other people’s jobs.
In order to appoint agents, to look after them, to answer for them, to unite and guide them in practice—it is necessary to be everywhere, to rush about, to see all of them on the job, at work.
This requires a team of practical organisers and leaders, but we haven’t got any; at least, very, very few to speak of.
.
.
.
That’s the whole trouble.
Looking at our practical mismanagement is often so infuriating that it robs one of the capacity for work; the only consolation is that it must be a vital cause if it is growing—and ob-viously it is—despite all this chaos.
That means when the ferment is over we shall have good wine.
Now do you understand why the mere remark by an Iskrist: “those agents of ‘yours’ are rather lightweight” can almost drive us to distraction? Try taking the place of these “lightweights” yourselves instead, we feel like saying.
We keep repeating and even writing in our booklets that the whole trouble is that “there are plenty of peopleand there are no people”, yet we have this lack of people thrust under our nose.
There is only one way out, only one solution that is most imperatively necessary, urgent in the most literal, unexaggerated sense of the word—for time will not wait and our enemies are growing too, includ-ing Osvobozhdeniye 146 and the Socialist-Revolutionaries and all the various new Social-Democratic groups, beginning with the lightheads of Zhizn and ending with the Borbist 147 intriguers.
The solution is for the Iskrists in Russia to get together at last, find the people and take the management of “Iskra” into their own hands, for truly it is said: our land is great and abundant, but disorder reigns in it.
People must be found, for there are people, but they must be guarded more carefully than the apple of one’s eye, not merely in the direct sense of guarding from the police, but guarded for this urgent matter, without allowing them to be divert-ed by other, generally useful but untimely tasks.
When, owing to a complete lack of people, we are compelled to seize on the most “lightweight”, it is not surprising that we cannot stand by calmly watching others postponing our work “for later on”.
If all the present, available supporters of Iskra were at once, without delaying, to take up the management of Iskra, its independent equipment with the means for sending across the frontier, its distribution, and supply of material, etc.
, we would have already an actual Central Committee, a C.
C.
disposing de facto of “agents” (for the C.
C.
and not the editorial board should dispose of the agents) and managing all practical matters.
It is being said: if there are no people, where is the C.
C.
to get them? But we do find the people, even if only light-weights.
One heavyweight among ten lightweights does not take the lead, but the experience will not have been wasted.
People learn in the course of the work: some drop out, others replace them, and once things have been set going it is ten times easier for the others to take up this work which has been running smoothly.
If we were to set up a C.
C.
today (not formally), tomorrow it would be formal and would already be drawing capable people from every local organisation ten times more energetically than now.
And it is only this “drawing from the local organisations”that can create a state of affairs under which these local organisations would be properly served.
That is why I am so jealous, so devilishly jealous about Semyon Semyonich 148 and why the glance (the mere glance) at an “outsider” worries me.
I can’t adopt any other at-titude, for unless the Iskrists say: this is my business, unless they say it out loud, unless they come to grips with the job, tackle it tooth and nail, unless they begin to up-braid the others for lack of tenacity [you once said to me: upbraid the Iskrists! And I replied: it is not I but you should do so, for only one who takes part practically in the work itself and who knows it thoroughly has the right to do so]— unless the Iskrists do this, it means that they want to leave us “only with lightweights”, and that would be the beginning of the end.
It is time to conclude.
I am extremely desirous that you and Cook should have as concrete an idea as possible of our position, understand it and say not you, but we.
In any case, it is essential that Cook should write to us frequently, and directly, and keep us in closer touch with Semyon Semyonich and the latter with us.
As to your visit here, if you still have to be in Zurich, that is a different matter.
Why are you feeling bad? Is your health quite all right? Should you not take a little rest? I am still unwell, so it is no use even thinking of a jour-ney.
Write me your opinion of Zernova and Sanin.
I have heard something about the latter from various persons and got the impression that he is no worker, that he is much too “ wild ” .
* Is it true that Zernova is a bad person, that is, not merely in the sense of being fond of “adventure ” (that, in itself, is not so bad) but as being unreliable? All the very best.

150 We whole-heartedly welcome your proposal for the closest contact and co-operation between Yuzhny Rabochy and Iskra.
The most vigorous steps should imme-diately be taken to consolidate these close relations and pass to united activities resulting from the unity of our views.
In the first place, we shall avail ourselves for this purpose of your proposal to negotiate with Chernyshev.

We have already taken steps for members of the Iskra organisation in Russia to meet you and confer about everything in detail.
Not to waste time, we ask you, too, to write to us about matters in greater detail.
What are the immediate practical plans of the editorial board of Yuzhny Rabochy? Is it in contact with the southern committees and does it have formal re-lations with them? From your statement that you intend to conduct affairs as they were conducted prior to the forma-tion of the League of Southern Committees and Organisa-tions 152 we infer that both the composition and trend of the present editorial board of Yuzhny Rabochy differ from the composition and trend which existed in the spring, at the * From abroad, write to Dietz in two envelopes, asking him to for-ward immediately to the editorial board of Iskra.

What exactly is the difference be-tween these trends, and what is the position adopted here by the southern committees, i.

What is your opinion of the extent of this divergence, does it pre-vent Party unity, and what measures are desirable for speedy achievement of solidarity? In what relation do the six provincial groups you have written about stand to the south-ern committees (and to the two trends which you have mentioned)? We should very much like you to help us to clear up fully all these questions, for that would be of great assistance in bringing closer together your friends and the members of the Iskra organisation in Russia working in the south.

KRASNUKHA AND YELENA STASOVA 153 A personal letter to Vanya and Varvara Ivanovna.
Please hand it immediately to them alone.
The news of Bouncer’s “victory” has astounded us.
154 Was the departure of Kasyan and Hairpin really sufficient to deprive the Iskrists of the ability to act? Bouncer’s protest could lead only to your proposing to him to put it to the vote and at once declaring by a majority, firstly, that on the substance of the question he is in an insignificant minority; and, secondly, that his complaint of violation of the Rules is ridiculous and petty-fogging (for, according to the Rules, the opinion should be asked of all who were present in St.
Petersburg and the matter not deferred pend-ing an inquiry of those who were absent).
If Bouncer raised (dared to raise) the question of disso-ciation, it was imperative at once to adopt a majority decision for his expulsion from the Union.
Obviously, Bouncer is brazenly heading “for war” and the Iskrists will be eternally disgraced if they do not reply to this by the most resolute and desperate war.
Do not be afraid of any threats on the part of Bouncer, you have nothing to fear from publicity, treat the matter immedi-ately as a war issue, as we have written above, and adopt the decisions proposed above as speedily as possible.
Even if Bouncer carries still others along with him (even if only half or less than half of you are left) you should all the same go the whole hog and demand Bouncer’s expulsion uncon-ditionally, without being the least afraid of a “split” in the Union.
You should also put an ultimatum to the workers too: either a split in the Union and war, or a decisive condem-nation of Bouncer by the workers and his expulsion.
We, for our part, are writing at once to 2a3b.
We are putting off the publication of the St.
Petersburg statement in Iskra.
155 We repeat: the question has now become a point of honour with the Iskra people of St.
Petersburg.

Of course, every-thing you do now must be done at a general meeting, to which Bouncer must be invited and minutes of the decisions taken.

KRASIKOV 156 Dear friend, I cannot find my notes on our meeting here.
157 In any case they are not needed.
The meeting was of a consultative nature and you two 158 of course, remember what happened better than I do.
I cannot reconstruct officially what took place, and I could not do so even if I had the jottings made exclusively for myself, sometimes not in words but by signs.
If there is anything important that needs to be settled, write a definite proposal, send in an official inquiry to us (to the editorial board) and we shall answer at once.
But if there is no occasion for it yet—well, we have reached full agreement on general tactics.
I was very, very glad to learn that you have rapidly gone forward in the matter of the O.
C.
159 and set it up with six members.
I am surprised only that you have co-opted others before the formal constitution, before the invitation of the Bund? Just the opposite was planned, wasn’t it? Incidentally, this is not so important if you are sure that it will cause no inconvenience.
Be stricter with the Bund! Be stricter, too, in writing to the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo abroad, reducing their function to such a minimum that in any case it cannot be of importance.
You can entrust technical arrangements of the Congress to special delegates from you or to your special agents; don’t hand over this matter to anyone and don’t forget that the people abroad are weak in secrecy techniques.
Outline the congress ordre du jour only in general terms.
Send us an enquiry asking to be informed of our (editorial) ordre du jour, who are our reporters and how many delegatesthere may be from us (from the editorial board).
Speed things up with the Congress as much as you can.
Try to provide mandates for those who have fled from Russia; that will economise expenses.
Be sure to inform us exactly of each and every official step taken by the Organising Committee.
And one thing more: Rabocheye Dyelo is dying and it would be very valuable if you (on behalf of the Organising Committee) were to send them an exhortation, in serious but not abusive terms, on the importance of uniting, on the value of conciliation, and so forth.
And so, make haste! In case of need, we shall raise a little money.

LEVIN Lenin writing.
We are very glad to note the successes and energy of the O.
C.
It is most important to exert every effort immediately to carry matters to a conclusion and as quickly as possible.
Try to replace speedily the member from St.
Petersburg (Ignat would be good) and write to us in detail about the attitude adopted towards the Organising Committee in various places (committees).
Will Ignat see Fyokla 160 soon? We need to know precisely and speedily.
We have drawn up the list of questions approximately as follows (in the order for their discussion): 1) attitude towards Boris 161? (If only a federation, then we should part at once and sit separately.
We need to prepare every-one for this.
) 2) The programme.
3) The Party Organ (the newspaper.
A new one or one of those already existing.
Insist on the importance of this preliminary question).
4) Organisation of the Party (basic principle: two central institutions, unsubordinated to each other.
a) The Central Organ—ideological leadership.
Abroad? b) The Central Committee—in Russia.
All practical direction.
Regular and frequent meetings between them and certain reciprocal membership rights or sometimes reciprocal co-optation.
It is extremely important to prepare the ground in advance for securing the adoption of this basic principle and for making it fully clear to everyone.
Next, the greatest possible centralisation.
Autonomy of the local committees in local affairs—with the Central Committee having the right of veto in exceptional cases.
District organisations only with the consent and endorsement of the Central Committee).
5) Various questions of tactics: terror, trade unions, legal-isation of the workers’ movement, strikes, demonstrations,uprising, agrarian policy and work among the peasantry and in the army, agitation in general; leaflets and pamphlets and so on and so forth; here no special order has been adhered to.
6) Attitude to other parties (Osvobozhdeniye, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Poles, Letts, etc.
).
7) Delegates’ reports (it is very important that there should be reports from every committee, and as full as possible (they should be prepared immediately and for safety’s sake copies should be given to the Organising Committee to be sent to us).
Try always to characterise the local Socialist-Revolutionaries and give an estimate of their strength and connections in the reports).
8) Groups and organisations abroad (Rabocheye Dyelo, Bor-ba, Zhizn, Svoboda.
162 A committee or the Central Commit-tee to be charged with working out a plan for their unifi-cation).
9) May Day.
10) The 1903 Congress in Amster-dam.
163 11) Internal organisational questions: finance, the type of organisation of the committees, the C.
C.
to take charge of shipment and distribution of literature, etc.
Some of these, probably, will have to be discussed in committees.
I repeat, this is merely a preliminary draft and only the order of items 1-5 has been discussed here jointly.
In this connection, among the members of the editorial board I was in favour of item 3 being put in one of the first places (i.
e.
, in fact, third), but another member (Pakhomy) was for putting it after item 5.
I consider it important to settle item 3 at the outset so as at once to give battle to all oppo-nents on a fundamental and broad issue and to ascertain the entire picture of the Congress (alternatively: to separate on an important issue).
Find out whether you will have reporters and on what questions (ad 5—in detail).
What pamphlet does Ignat want published? Is it not the letter to Yeryoma * ? Be sure to obtain from each committee (and group) an official and written reply as to whether they recognise the Organising Committee.
It is essential to have this at once.
I advise that the announcement about the Organising Committee should be issued in Russia as well (i.
e.
, not * The reference is to Lenin’s “A Letter to a Comrade on Our Orga-nisational Tasks” (see present edition, Vol.
6).
—Ed.
only printed in Iskra); issue it even if only in hectographed form.
We shall send the general editorial draft of the questions and the list of our reporters when we have made contact about this with all the members of the editorial board who are living in various countries at present.
Appoint immediately members of the Organising Com-mittee in the chief centres (Kiev, Moscow, St.
Petersburg), and give secret addresses for rendezvous with them so that we can be sure that all those whom we send are under the full disposal of the Organising Committee.
This is very, very important.
Finally, one thing more: Ignat’s meeting with Fyokla must be arranged to take place after 1) he has seen all and everyone he possibly can; 2) you have received from every-one official recognition of the Organising Committee; 3) you have officially informed “Rabocheye Dyelo” as well that they will have a plenipotentiary member of the Orga-nising Committee.
Only under these conditions can the meet-ing of Ignat and Fyokla lead to further important practical steps.
Ignat should therefore make haste with these prelim-inary measures and not forget that he should come to Fyokla’s equipped with formally acknowledged and the widest (N.
B.
!) plenary powers.

PLEKHANOV December 14, 1902 Dear G.
V.
, There has been no news from you for quite a time and a lot of business and questions have accumulated.
First of all, about articles for Iskra.
For No.
30 (No.
29 will come out tomorrow or the day after) we have Julius’s article “Autumnal Summing-up”.
One more article is essential.
How about you? Please let us know whether you are writing anything and when you are thinking of sending it, and also about a feuilleton; it would be very good to have in No.
30 the feuilleton you proposed against Tarasov’s “little page”.
164 I shall await your reply.
Next, about a pamphlet against the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries.
L.
Gr.
told me and wrote to you that it would be best if you undertook it, for you could give, in addition to “dogmatic” criticism, the historical parallel with the sev-enties.
I fully agree with L.
Gr.
that such a parallel is very, very important; but there is no use, of course, in my even thinking about it.
And in general I should be very glad if you would undertake this pamphlet.
I have little heart for it myself; besides, in addition to current business, I am now faced with the task of preparing for lectures in Paris (Julius tells me that they want to invite me there for three or four lectures on the agrarian question).
And so, absolutely everything points to the pamphlet being your job—it is most definitely needed against the Socialist-Rev-olutionaries, who must be picked to pieces in the most detailed and thoroughgoing manner.
They are awfully harm-ful to us and our cause.
Do write and tell us your decision.
L.
Gr.
’s answer to Revolutsionnaya Rossiya 165 was pub-lished in No.
29: you will receive it towards the end of the week—and you have already seen the proofs.
I learnt today that you will be at the international con-ference in Brussels (probably at the end of December or beginning of January 166 ) and will read a lecture there.
I hope you will not fail to drop in on us.
We are right next door and the fare will be quite cheap during the holidays.
And here, firstly, your lecture is very badly needed, as there are many workers here who are infected with anarchism (I discovered this when I delivered my lecture on the So-cialist-Revolutionaries, which did not interest our people here 167 ).
You would certainly be able to influence them.
Furthermore, and this is the chief thing, we have a heap of important subjects to discuss, especially as regards Rus-sian affairs: the Organising Committee, after long prepara-tion, has at last been formed there and it can play a tre-mendous role.
It is of the highest importance that we should jointly reply to a whole series of questions which it has al-ready addressed to us (questions concerning measures for uniting the Party, the agenda, Tagesordnung, at the general congress, what reports there will be from us, etc.
—extreme-ly important questions in general, and now of particular significance).
Write, please, as to when exactly the con-ference in Brussels will be held, how long it will last and whether you will be able to come here.
Further, it may, perhaps, not be out of place if at this conference you al-ready make use in one way or another of the fact that the Organising Committee has been set up.
Write soon and we shall get in touch with Russia: we may succeed even in getting some sort of statement or letter from them addressed to you, if needed.
Do you see the Zhiznites 168? How is the “rapprochement” with them progressing and what are the chances? And what about the Rabocheye Dyelo people? You know, I believe it would be a good thing if they too took part in your “Marx-ist circle” and if we began (informally) to come closer to them.
It is not worth while these days quarrelling with them, and there is no reason to, as a matter of fact: by replacing Rabocheye Dyelo by Krasnoye Znamya169 they have in effect adopted our plan for “division of literary functions”, and(apart from the silly “clairvoyant”) there is nothing harm-ful in Martynov’s pamphlet Workers and Revolution.
All the very best.
Yours, Lenin As for the Bulgarian, * I am to blame.

LAVROV AND YELENA STASOVA 170 December 27 We have received Vlas’s letter.
We shall give you what help we can.
We have long been aware of your plight and have been thinking of assistance.
But you must immediately and without fail write us an accurate account of the split in St.
Petersburg.
Answer the following points: l) Was the Organisation Committee (the summer one) elected by the League of Struggle 171 alone (= committee of intellectuals?) or by the Workers’ Organi-sation 172 as well? 2) When exactly was it elected? 3) Is there a precise record of its powers (i.
e.
, what it was charged with doing)? 4) Wherein lay the irregularity of its elec-tion, according to Bouncer and Co.
? 5) Were there delegates from the Workers’ Organisation (two?) in the Organisation Committee and by whom were they elected? 6) From what has Bouncer been chucked out—from the Organisation Com-mittee or the Intellectuals’ Committee or the Workers’ Organisation? 7) What Workers’ Organisation is it that now writes its declarations? A new one? A reorganised one? when? how? 8) Why have you not sent us the September leaflet of the Committee of the Workers’ Organisation? 9) Why have you not issued even a handwritten leaflet against them?—or sent us a counter-declaration? Not one of their moves should be left unanswered.
10) What is this C.
C.
like now? Is there still an Organisation Committee? Are there workers on your side? Why haven’t they formed a counter-organisation? Why don’t your workers protest against Bouncer workers and their committee?Send us immediately new, absolutely unused places of rendezvous for visitors.
Do not give these (our) rendezvous to anyone else.
Seek out beforehand a flat to shelter one person.
Take special care to cover up traces of his contacts with the old members (Heron and others), who are probably being shadowed.

LENGNIK 173 December 27 We have received the letter about the coup d’état * and are replying at once.
We are astounded that Zarin could allow such a scandal! There you have the fruits of his mis-take in not joining the Committee!—a step we were insist-ing on long ago.
We shall not publish anything about the statement for the time being, for we have received neither the statement nor the letter against it.
Commence hostili-ties by all means, make Zarin join, drew up a minute of the break (or the number of votes pro and contra), and issue a local leaflet on the causes of the split (or divergence).
There is no sense in publishing the statement without such official documents about each of your steps.
Be sure to put on record each step of the Rabocheye Dyelo supporters and of yours against them, and do not yield one iota.
They must be shown up as being against the Organising Commit-tee, whilst you are for it.
It is on the basis of recognition (or non-recognition) of the Organising Committee that de-cisive battle should promptly be given everywhere; convey this most insistently to Zarin and his immediate Genossen.
And so, let Zarin display redoubled energy and fight for Kiev—that is his prime duty.
The literature is in Russia and should soon be in your hands.
You must send not less than two poods to our people in St.

BABUSHKIN 174 For Novitskaya from Lenin Dear friend, As regards the “examination”, 175 I must say that it is impossible to propose an examination programme from here.
Let all the propagandists write about the programme on which they are lecturing or wish to lecture, and I shall answer in detail.
You ask for more questions to be put to you.
Very well, only mind you answer them all: 1) What are the present Rules of the St.
Petersburg Committee? 2) Is there “discussion”? 3) What is its position in relation to the Central Committee and the Workers’ Organisation? 4) The attitude of the C.
C.
to the district organisation and to the workers’ groups? 5) Why did the Iskrist workers tacitly permit Bouncer workers to call themselves a “Work-ers’ Organisation Committee”? 6) Have measures been taken to keep track of every step of the St.
Petersburg Zubatov organisation 176 ? 7) Are regular lectures read (or talks arranged) in the workers’ circles on the subject of organisation, on the significance of an “organisation of revolutionaries”? 8) Is propaganda widely conducted among the workers to the effect that it is they who should pass to an illegal position as frequently and extensively as possi-ble? 9) Have measures been taken to ensure ten times as many letters from St.
Petersburg, the flow of which has been held up for a disgracefully long time? 10) Is the idea being inculcated among all workers that it is they who ought to organise a printing-press for leaflets and the proper distribution of the latter?There are ten questions for you.
I send you warm greetings and await your reply.
Mind you disappear at the first sign that you are being spied on.
Written January 6 , 1 9 0 3 Sent from London to St.
Petersburg First published in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original47 TO YELENA STASOVA We have received (from somewhere abroad) a new Boun-cer document, dated October 1902, a programme and prin-ciples of organisation—muddled and pernicious.
We are devilishly vexed and offended at your failure to send us immediately and directly (in two copies to different addresses all the St.
Petersburg productions.
It is simply outra-geous that up to now we have not had the first leaflet of the Bouncer people (the July “protest” against the recogni-tion of Iskra) and only learnt about it from Otkliki 177 ! Surely it is not difficult to send leaflets when all letters arrive quite all right! More outrageous still is the fact that you hold up your replies so long.
Ignat has told us that his leaflet replying to the Bouncer drivel was written a long time ago, but that you held it up and substituted another one, longer, feebler and more watered-down, only in the end to publish none at all! If it couldn’t be published, surely it could have been sent here in a letter! For Christ’s sake, explain what is the matter; is it due to sheer bungling oversight on the part of someone in the Committee (or of the whole Committee?) or to deliberate opposition and intrigue within the Committee? We cannot rid ourselves of the impression inevitably created by all this: namely, that the Bouncers are steadily ousting you, deceiving you and before long will kick you out altogether.
We would strongly advise electing Bogdan in place of the missing member of the Organising Committee fromSt.
Petersburg 178 ; he fully deserves it.
And in general, apparently, things will never advance an inch without professional revolutionaries.

January 15 (From Lenin.
) Dear comrades, many thanks for your detailed letter on the state of affairs; such letters are rarely written to us although we are in very great need of them and ten times as many are essential if we really want to establish a living connection between the editorial board abroad and the local Party workers, and make Iskra a full reflection of our working-class movement, both as a whole and as regards particular features of it.
We therefore beg you to continue on the same lines, and at least sometimes to give us straight pictures of talks with workers (what do they talk about in the circles? What are their complaints? perplexities? requirements? the subjects of the talks? and so on and so forth).
The plan of your organisation, apparently, is suitable for a rational organisation of revolutionaries, insofar as it is possible to say “rational” when there is such a lack of people, and insofar as we can judge of the plan from a brief account of it.
Give us more details about the independents.
Further questions: Are there no workers of the “Ivanovo-Vozne-sensk” school and tradition left in Kharkov? Are there any persons who once directly belonged to this Economist and “anti-intellectualist” company or only their successors? Why don’t you write anything about the “leaflet of workers’ mutual aid societies”, and why don’t you send it to us? We here have seen only a handwritten copy of No.
2 of this leaflet.
What sort of group is issuing it? Are they out-and-out Economists or merely green youths? Is it a purely work-ing-class organisation or is it under the influence of Econo-mist intellectuals?Are any traces left of the Kharkovsky Proletary 179 group? Is Iskra read in the workers’ circles? With explanations of the articles? Which articles are more eagerly read and what kind of explanations are required? Is propaganda of secrecy methods and transition to an illegal position conducted among the workers on a large scale? Try to make more use of the St.
Petersburg Zubatov or-ganisation and go on sending workers’ letters.

It is now as clear as daylight that the Bouncers are fooling you and leading you by the nose when they as-sure you of their agreement with Zarya and Iskra.
Come out with a militant protest immediately (if you are not able to publish it, send it here at once, in any case a copy), wage war vigorously and carry it widely into the midst of the workers.
Any delay and any conciliation with the Bouncers would now be not only arch-stupidity but abso-lutely disgraceful.
And so long as you have Bogdan, you can’t complain of being shorthanded (help has been sent).

BABUSHKIN January 16 We have received from Geneva Rabochaya Mysl No.
16 (evidently published and even written by Svoboda, i.
e.
, by Nadezhdin) already labelled as the organ of the St.
Petersburg Committee.
It has a letter of the Bouncers mak-ing a correction, a trivial correction, strictly speaking not a correction at all but a compliment to Svoboda.
If the Bouncers assure you of their solidarity with Zarya and Iskra, that is obvious deception, the sheer humbug of peo-ple who are playing for time in order to gain strength.
We earnestly and insistently advise you therefore to issue im-mediately (and if you cannot issue it, send it here) a leaflet protesting in the name of the Committee and in general to refute all conciliatory manoeuvres and approaches, and to launch a vigorous war, a ruthless war, against the Boun-cers, with an exposure of their defection from Social-Democ-racy to the “Revolutionary-Socialist” Svoboda.
We ap-prove the energetic behaviour of Novitskaya and once again ask you to continue in the same militant spirit, without allowing the slightest vacillations.
War on the Bouncers and to hell with all conciliators, people of “elusive views” and shilly-shallyers! Better a small fish than a big beetle.
Bet-ter two or three energetic and wholly devoted people than a dozen dawdlers.
Write as often as possible and, without delay, give us access to your workers (and a characterisation of them) so that in case of arrests we shall not be stranded.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY January 27 Old Man writing.
I have read your angry letter of Jan-uary 3 and am replying at once.
Regarding correspondence, dogs, 181 etc.
, the secretary 182 will reply below: I can no longer make out who is to blame but we absolutely must be in constant touch, not less frequently than twice a month, but so far this has not been the case and we have heard nothing about you for long periods at a time.
Don’t forget that when we have no letters, we can’t do anything, we do not know whether people are alive or not; we are com-pelled, simply compelled, to consider them almost non-exist-ent.
You did not answer my question about Brutus’s trans-ference; apparently, there is little hope of any good ar-rangement until this transference takes place.
Now to busi-ness.
In criticising us, you overestimate our strength and influence; we reached agreement here about the Organis-ing Committee, we insisted on its meeting, on your being invited, and we wrote to you.
We could do nothing more than that, absolutely nothing, and we do not answer for anything.
The trouble is that Brutus was not in the Organ-ising Committee, and all subsequent action was taken without him (as also without us) We have not accepted an unknown member (he is of the dawdler type, unintelligent; I knew him personally in Pskov, tied down by family and place, backward, no good at all, Pankrat had al-ready been criticised because of him), we have not trans-ferred the bureau, we have given absolutely no “power” to Pankrat.
But when it turned out that Pankrat was the sole (N.
B.
, N.
B.
) mobile person of the Organising Commit-tee, the result could not but be power as well.
You write: there are people, but we do not have them, do not know them, do not see them.
We have worked ourselves up to neurasthenia over the total lack of persons for the Organising Committee, which requires mobile, flying, free and illegal people.
Pankrat alone went over to illegality, travelled,began to fly, began to know everything—and assumed the rank of corporal as a matter of course.
We did not interfere, naturally, because we neither could interfere nor wanted to interfere; there was no other! Try to understand this.
Pankrat is indolent and careless, but he is clever, sensible, knows the job, knows how to fight and is a man you can get on with.
Now he is stranded [in Paris] indefinitely, and we are going for him baldheaded, driving him to Russia, as otherwise the Organising Committee is nothing but a cipher.
“She” (Akim’s brother) will go shortly, we shall try to get “her” into the O.
C.
; “she”, I believe, is energetic.
Pen does not want to go away.
There are no passports, and no copies.
If Brutus moves to a nearby, lively place, we shall help him to get the bureau back, 183 and everything will be straightened out, perhaps.
Otherwise everything will proceed (if it does proceed) by the will of Allah, the will of Pankrat, and “her” will, and we are powerless in the matter.
The literature has been sent off.
Over 40 poods have been shipped.
We are publishing the statement of the Organising Committee in No.
32, which will come out the day after tomorrow.
Uncle, too, is still standing aside (like Brutus) and has not even gone anywhere; if only he and Brutus would settle in Poltava at least, they would take over the bureau.
I am very annoyed with Zarin; his letters convey nothing, he is inert, knows nothing about Kiev, and has allowed a split to take place under his very nose.
To keep aloof from local affairs to such an extent is simply outrageous! Is it our fault that, of the two “equal members” of the Organising Committee, Zarin “sits and says nothing”, while Pankrat at least is stirring a little? I think (I don’t know for certain) that Zarin is a person with little initiative and one who is tied down by legality and place.
And now such peo-ple, alas, remain aloof, and through no fault or will of ours.
Written January 2 7 , 1 9 0 3 Sent from London to Samara First published in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original52 TO THE UNION OF RUSSIAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATS ABROAD 184 To the Union of Russian Social-Democrats In reply to the letter of the Union of Russian Social-Dem-ocrats to the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy, received by us on February 4, 1903, we hasten to inform the Union of Russian Social-Democrats that we entirely share its opinion as to the need to form a foreign section of the Organising Committee in Russia.
It is true that we cannot at all agree with the opinion of the Union of the R.
S.
D.
that the Organising Committee “wrongly or inaccurately ascribes its origin to private initiative”, for the O.
C.
refers directly to the decision of the conference (the O.
C.
was in fact set up in fulfilment of such a decision).
Moreover, the O.
C.
was formed by organisations which took part in the conference.
The fact that the O.
C.
has not straight away and without inquiring the opinion of the remaining Party organisations declared itself an official Party body is, in our view, evidence of the Organising Committee’s correct understanding of its tasks, and of its tact and cau-tion, which are so important in a serious Party matter.
It should be said at once, though, that we do not attach any great importance to our above-mentioned disagree-ment with the Union of the R.
S.
D.
; on the contrary, we have every hope that this disagreement will be easily dispelled with the development of the Organising Committee’s activity.
Further, we would consider it inexpedient, even not quite lawful on our part, “to proceed immediately to consti-tute a foreign section of the O.
C.
”, unless there was a direct invitation from the O.
C.
in Russia.
We have been informedthat the O.
C.
has already written to the Bund in Russia and to the Union of the R.
S.
D.
Abroad.
We do not have the text of either letter.
In any case, it follows from the above that the O.
C.
in Russia is already taking steps in this direction.
It would hardly be wise on our part to begin to act without waiting for the result of these steps of the Organising Committee.
We consider it our duty to bring the letter of the Union of the R.
S.
D.
immediately to the notice of the O.
C.
in Russia and at the same time we shall communicate to the O.
C.
our opinion of the desirability of the O.
C.
in Russia immediately setting up its foreign section.
We would sug-gest waiting for a reply from the O.
C.
in Russia.
If, how-ever, the comrades of the Bund Committee Abroad and of the Union of the R.
S.
D.
consider that, before receiving this reply, it would be useful to arrange a private meeting of representatives of the Bund Committee Abroad, the Union of the R.
S.
D.
, and the League of Russian Revolu-tionary Social-Democracy, we would not, of course, refuse to take part.

O.
MARTOV 185 February 5, 1903 I am sending you a copy of the Union’s letter and the draft of our reply.
* The reply was sent to Plekhanov who was to await your letter from Paris.
Arrange a meeting with P.
Andr.
and Boris immediately and answer Plekha-nov as quickly as possible whether you are satisfied with the reply or whether changes are required.
It would be desirable, of course, not to delay the reply to the Unionists, but if changes are voted it will entail a pretty long delay; perhaps unimportant changes can be disregarded.
But, of course, if there is disagreement on the substance of the question, it will be necessary to hold up the reply (I am writing to Plekhanov about this) and have everyone vote.
In my opinion (with which V.
I.
and L.
Gr.
agree) the most important thing here is that 1) the foreign section of the O.
C.
186 should be precisely a section of the Organ-ising Committee in Russia.
The Unionists’ idea, I believe, is to have two sections with equal rights: one in Russia, the other abroad.
By no means can we accept or allow such an interpretation.
The O.
C.
in Russia must act cautiously (in this respect its announcement is admirably drawn up), but in all matters and in all approaches made to it, must behave with the utmost formality and rigour, that is to say, in such a way that it, the O.
C.
in Russia, controls every-thing and no one in the Party can do anything of a general Party character or in the way of general obligations, unless authorised to do so by the Organising Committee in Russia.
* See pp.
139-40 of this volume.
—Ed.
Yet the Unionists, by their letter, recognise (or almost three-quarters recognise) the O.
C.
and the more they rec-ognise it, the more formally and firmly must the Organ-ising Committee behave.
It is of the highest importance to adopt the right tone from the very beginning and to take such a stand that the Party position is made quite clear: either recognition of the present O.
C.
and subordi-nation to it, or war.
Tertium non datur.
* Even now there is every chance of obtaining general recognition, without offending or irritating anyone, but without giving way in the slightest degree.
2) The O.
C.
should reduce the functions of its foreign section to a minimum.
The foreign section only “deals with” affairs abroad (in the sense of preparing for unity) and assists the Russian section.
On every other question that goes the least beyond those limits, the foreign section of the O.
C.
must request the opinion and decision of the Organ-ising Committee in Russia.
I strongly urge, therefore, that the O.
C.
in Russia should as soon as possible write a letter to the Union, the League and the Bund proposing that they should form a section of their own for exercising such-and-such functions.
It is essential that the O.
C.
in Russia should indicate the “limits of authority” to its foreign section, and I propose below an outline of these functions with three and only three strictly limited items.
I earnestly request you to discuss this draft as quickly as possible with P.
A.
and Boris and confirm it (alternatively, put changes to the vote).
(We shall send all these data to Yuri 187 as well, asking him to await the arrival of P.
A.
and Boris, who should do everything to hasten their arrival.
) (Of course, P.
A.
could write a letter to the League, the Union and the Bund Committee Abroad from here, but I think this is in the highest degree undesirable, for people will suspect a put-up job and a fiction.
Better to wait a week or two, and have the letter sent without fail from Russia.
) I also believe we must think of electing a member of ours to the O.
C.
(the foreign section) and vote on it in advance, for owing to the members being in different places * There is no third way.
—Ed.
this can take much time and it will be unpleasant if things have to wait on this account.
For my part, I vote for L.
Gr.
I positively do not have time to write to Plekhanov as well.
You will simply forward to him at once both this letter and the reply to the Union, and meanwhile I will drop him a line.
All the best.

To Nizhni As regards the appeal, I (Lenin) find your decision reas-onable 188 —I have not had time yet (nor a chance) to con-sult my associates.
* The courage of the Nizhni-Novgorod workers, who asked that their personal well-being should not be taken into account, ought to be mentioned in Iskra; it would be desirable for you to write a letter about this to the editors.
We received via Berlin the “Letter to the Iskra Editorial Board from the Nizhni-Novgorod Committee”, a long let-ter, about terrorism, with a defence (partial and condi-tional) of terrorism; the end is missing (apparently).
Write immediately: 1) Did the Nizhni-Novgorod Committee send this letter officially? 2) Repeat the end of it (the letter has seven paragraphs and ends with the words: “They clear the atmosphere, which is often too heavy, they teach the government to handle the revolutionaries more carefully”).
3) Let us know whether you allow stylistic corrections (in some places the style is very bad, due perhaps to incor-rect, hasty and unclear copying).
We shall probably publish the letter together with our reply.
We earnestly and insistently beg you to inform us in your letters without delay of every official step taken by the Committee (dispatch of a document for travelling war-* I may yet be able to return to this question.

189 The leaflet itself we received not long ago by chance from Berlin, and with delay.
Good heavens! This is simply outrageous! Surely it wasn’t difficult for the Committee to write to us about the leaflet and send us a copy of it as soon as it came out.
For heaven’s sake, take all the necessary steps to correct these shortcomings.
55 TO THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE WITH THE TEXT OF NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA’S LETTER I have received the letter of the O.
C.
I suggest answering like this: “In our opinion, the question of the ‘ordre du jour’ stands as follows.
This question of the agenda will be definitely settled by the Congress itself, and only by the Congress.
Consequently, it is quite useless to dispute about the right to vote on this point.
Further, the bulk of the committees have already recognised the ‘exclusive initiative’ of the O.
C.
in convening the Congress.
Hence it follows that the preliminary preparation for the Congress, including pre-liminary preparation (or propaganda) of the ordre du jour, is exclusively a matter for the Organising Committee.
It is, therefore, altogether superfluous to propose that anyone should vote as well on a ‘preliminary’ ordre du jour; it cannot have any decisive significance.
Furthermore, it will merely cause both delay and dissatisfaction, for there will be people who will be offended (committees that were not consulted), and people who will inevitably be dissatisfied and complaining.
Consequently, from the standpoint of both formal loyalty and tact no formal decision should be taken about collecting the votes of the committees or of anyone at all.
It would only undermine the authority of the Organising Committee if it renounces the exclusive initia-tive entrusted to it.
“If it is very inconvenient now to alter an adopted (and formally unexceptionable) decision, there may be, per-haps, the following way out: turn the voting (of the commit-tees) into a consultation with them, that is to say, adopt a decision that as far as possible the O.
C.
will try to make use of meetings and talks for consultation.
“Finally, we advise making haste with the Congress.
The sooner you convene it, the better.
And set to work im-mediately and more actively preparing the committees, nominating delegates, winning over Nikolayev and Odessa.
The important thing is to make perfectly sure of a safe majority of firm Iskrists.

C.
We have just received the rules of the Congress.
It appears that we did not understand you and replied about the ordre du jour when you were asking about the rules of the Con-gress.
We hasten to say that on the whole we are very satis-fied with your draft, which is carefully and sensibly drawn up.
Clause 19, which has evoked dispute, seems reasonable to us; to exclude certain organisations from the Congress (and, in the final analysis, the rules are precisely regulations for the exclusion of some and the granting of rights to others) is in fact inconvenient and impossible without the agree-ment of the majority of the committees.
Our only advice would be to fix a formally binding period as short as possible (for example, not more than a week) in the course of which the committees and organisations are obliged to draw up and send in their amendments to the draft rules.
This is essential in order to avoid delay, which is most of all to be feared.
(It is probably through fear of delay that Ignat, too, protested.
We understand his fears, but if you are able to complete the interrogation quickly, the matter can be put right.
) For our part, we shall write to the Iskra organisations about our advice that your draft should be accepted im-mediately and completely.
We earnestly request you to make use of every facility to ensure that the dispatch and communication of the draft (on the basis of § 19), the “session” of the arbitration courts, and determination of the compo-sition of the deputies will be completed within a month at the latest.
In this connection we advise you informally to recom-mend all qualified organisations to appoint as far as possible one (or two) delegates from among comrades living abroad who are known for their past work—in order to avoid extra expenses and difficulties involved in sending delegates abroad.
We formally propose 1) to supplement your draft only by a note to § 19: “Organisations which have not presented their comments within a week from the date of receipt of the draft will be regarded as having accepted the draft rules of the Congress”; 2) to make provision for alternate delegates in the event of delegates being arrested before the Congress.

PLEKHANOV March 15, 1903 Dear G.
V.
, I have received your letter.
You are writing “The Ides of March”, that is excellent.
The dead -line is March 25, 1903— the article must be here.
We expect it without fail.
Maslov’s book is being sent to me in a few days from Paris (I shall ask them to make haste) and I shall send it on to you at once.
191 It contains interesting data on the harm of the village commune, which I quoted in Paris.
192 I had already ordered David’s book and am now reading it.
Terribly watery, poor and trite.
I am trying to finish it quickly so as to send it on to you.
Have you seen Kaut-sky’s articles on this “neo-Proudhonist”193? I have now set to work on a popular pamphlet for the peas-ants on our agrarian programme.
* I should very much like to demonstrate our idea of the class struggle in the countryside on the basis of concrete data on the four sec-tions of the village population (landowners, peasant bour-geoisie, middle peasantry, and semi-proletarians together with proletarians).
What do you think of such a plan? From Paris I came away with the conviction that only such a pamphlet could dispel the perplexities about the cut-off lands, etc.
About the Manifesto of February 26 I have written an article which will appear in No.

In my opinion, this is even preposterous.
All the very best.
Yours, Lenin Sent from London to Geneva First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original58 TO THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE We advise that steps be taken immediately to have the O.
C.
together with the Polish Social-Democrats issue a formal declaration (as detailed and precise as possible) on their full solidarity with the Russian S.
D.
L.
P.
and their desire to join the Party.
On the basis of such a formally published statement the O.
C.
could invite the Polish Social-Democrats to the Congress.
Then, surely, no one will protest.
194 Next (privately), we earnestly request you everywhere and among everyone to prepare the ground for a struggle against the Bund at the Congress.
Without a stubborn strug-gle the Bund will not surrender its position.
And we can never accept its position.
Only firm determination on our part to go through to the end, to the expulsion of the Bund from the Party, will undoubtedly compel it to give way.
Make haste with the list; it is very important and must be done quickly, without waiting for a reply from the com-mittees.
By the way, were the committees given a short time within which to reply? Are you keeping a list of the delegates already appointed? (Send it to us as an additional precaution.

M.
KRZHIZHANOVSKY (The Old Man.
) There is little I can tell you this time.
The main thing now, in my opinion, is to make every effort to expedite the Congress and ensure a majority of intelligent (and “our”) delegates.
Almost all our hope is on Brutus.
As far as pos-sible, he should himself keep an eye on everything, espe-cially the delegates, and try to get the maximum number of our people appointed.
The system of two votes from each committee is very favourable for this.
Next, the question of the Bund is very important.
We have stopped the polemic with it over the O.
C.
, but not, of course, the polemic over principles.
That is out of the question.
We must make everyone understand, simply “ram it into every head”, that it is necessary to prepare for war against the Bund if we want peace with it.
War at the Congress, war even to the extent of a split—whatever the cost.
Only then will the Bund be sure to surrender.
We absolutely cannot accept, and never will accept, the stupid idea of federation.
At the very most—autonomy according to the old Rules of 1898 with a delegate appointed by the C.
C.
taking part in the C.
C.
of the Bund.
We must prepare our people, we must explain the stupidity and demonstrate the absurdity of the attack on Ekaterinoslav, 195 and so on.
Please write speedily and let us know what the feeling is in this respect, how your propaganda is going and whether there is any hope of the majority taking the right stand.
We should like to issue a pamphlet to the Jewish workers on the necessity of a close union and the stupidity of federation and “national” policy.
Written April 3 , 1 9 0 3 Sent from London to Samara First published in full in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original60 TO THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE April 6, 1903 In transmitting to the O.
C.
the inquiry of the foreign section of the O.
C.
, 196 we for our part earnestly advise you not to widen the functions of the foreign section in any way and not to allow it to extend its bounds by a single inch, as it is making every effort to do.
In the interests of the work, the functions of the foreign section of the O.
C.
should in no way go beyond preparing the secret part of the Congress, collecting money and, at most, discussion of the conditions for uniting the Social-Democratic organisations abroad in the form of a preliminary preparation of this question.
Regarding point 1 a), we are strongly against giving the address of the O.
C.
’s foreign section to the committees.
The functions of the foreign section being what they are, this is quite pointless.
It is not without its dangers in the sense of causing delay and confusion.
As regards publicity, it should be frankly stated that everything will be pub-lished in Iskra (the formal basis for this is its recognition by the majority of the committees).
Other organisations should be formally recommended to reprint all the statements of the O.
C.
from Iskra.
As regards contact between the O.
C.
and its foreign section, we advise the following arrangement: the O.
C.
will communicate with Deutsch through the usual channels (Deutsch is the secretary of the O.
C.
’s foreign section, which also includes Alexander and Lokhov).
And you will communicate with Deutsch through us, as before.
This is quite natural; the foreign section of the O.
C.
elected a secretary and you have endorsed his election.
To the second question we advise that you reply by agreeing, and to the third by an explanation that the agenda will be presented and is already being prepared.
Sent from London to Kharkov First published in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original61 TO YEKATERINA ALEXANDROVA 197 Private, from Lenin I have road your long letter, for which many thanks.
Better late than never.
You ask me not to be very cross.
As a matter of fact, I was hardly cross at all, and was more inclined to smile at the recollection of my last conversation at the door of the “den” 198 with a certain Jacques, who considered at that time (at that time!) that we did too little bossing.
That things take a long time adjusting themselves within the O.
C.
, that there is still a huge amount of disor-der and anarchy, I was quite aware and have not expected anything else.
The only cure for that is persistent treat-ment (time and experience) and a single potent remedy (a general Party congress).
I wrote long ago and I repeat it: hurry up, for heaven’s sake, with this remedy as much as you can, otherwise there is a risk of your experience being lost altogether.
I am not going to write about the questions of 1) Yuri, 199 2) the Bureau, and 3) Ignat’s dispute with Bundist.
In part, they have become obsolete; in part, they require to be settled on the spot, and as regards this last part my ad-vice at best would be to no purpose (despite the opinion of my friend Jacques).
This part you (all of you) have to decide for yourselves, “have to” not in the sense of sollen * but of müssen.
** I will say something about the Bund, the P.
P.
S.
200 and “heresy”.
Formally, I think, our attitude to the Bund should be studiously correct (no hitting straight in the teeth), but * Should.
—Ed.
** Must.
—Ed.
at the same time icily cold, buttoned up to the neck, and on legitimate ground we should press hard against the Bund relentlessly and all the time, going right to the end without being afraid.
Let them get out, if they want to, but we should not give them the slightest occasion, the shadow of an excuse, for a break.
We must, of course, observe the formalities prior to the Congress, but there is no point in showing our cards.
You write: Bundist knows we are working for Iskra but keeps silent, although we have no right to do so in the name of the O.
C.
In my opinion, this should not be done from the O.
C.
but from each member personally, referring not to the O.
C.
, but to the committees which have recognised Iskra.
The result is the same and even much stronger (there are no “agents”), and the formal aspect is irreproachable.
Preparing the committees against the Bund is one of the most important tasks of the present moment, and it, too, is fully possible without any violation of form.
Similarly, it was wrong to speak to the P.
P.
S.
about the “convictions of members of the Organising Committee”.
It should have been said of the O.
C.
: we are preparing the congress, and the congress will decide; and on the question of “convictions” one should not remain silent but refer, not to the O.
C.
, but to Iskra and still more to the commit-tees that have recognised Iskra.
Furthermore, we should obtain from the P.
P.
S.
a formal if only short document (a letter), and not say to them “we are anti-nationalists” (why frighten people needlessly?), but gently persuade them that our programme (recognition of the right of national self-determination) is adequate for them too, drawing from them definite counter-declarations and a formal approach to the O.
C.
and the Congress.
Our trump card against the P.
P.
S.
is that we recognise national self-determination in principle, but within reasonable limits determined by the unity of the proletarian class struggle.
Before I forget: I really do not know the representatives of the Russian organisation of Iskra in the O.
C.
Nor do I know why I should know this, and why there should be “representatives”.
The Organising Committee has long ago co-opted all sorts of good people, but they were not “repre-sentatives”, were they? Or is this untrue?It is important, I think, to make use of the distinction between the Russian organisation of Iskra and the O.
C.
precisely for the sake of formal irreproachability.
Now about “heresy”.
Either I misunderstand you, or this is a great mistake.
In view of the extreme brevity of your letter on this (highly important) point, I can only take your words à la lettre.
Four delegates “organise” both the C.
C.
and the Central Organ! Frankly, this is simply ridiculous, for you ought to know that the only people competent (i.
e.
, having the knowledge and necessary experience) to “organise” the Central Organ are the members of the editorial board & individuals from outside for consul-tation, while the only people competent to organise the C.
C.
are experienced practical workers & individuals for consul-tation (if you know of such persons).
Or do you, perhaps, know of a “foursome” who have experience and knowledge of all these things? If you do, then name them—seriously.
I am not joking, for this letter of mine is a personal one and it is important for me to be clear about your idea.
You are out for a single centre of power and a “strong hand”, if I am not mistaken.
It would be a good thing and you are absolutely right that that is what we need.
But no one can achieve it in such a forthright way as you are thinking of.
For nine-tenths of current affairs, two central bodies are absolutely essential; they would immediately arise of themselves, even if we did not want this.
For form’s sake, however, we should try to achieve 1) a formal way of uniting these two central bodies (for example, a committee with delegates from both of them), 2) a reduction in the number of members of the two central bodies, or the selection of an executive committee within each central body, and— most important—3) a strict, formal distribution of functions among individual members of the central bodies, so that their whole membership should know precisely which mem-ber is charged with managing what, which member (in each centre) has the right to decide (and even to speak) in each sphere of problems, and in what way matters can be trans-ferred to a plenary meeting of one or both of the central bodies.
I am confident that you will considerably moderate your demands and will agree that this is the maximum immedi-ately desirable.
Even that is very, very difficult and I do not see any people who are fully suitable, informed, and experienced enough for such a distribution of functions.
There is a great deal, a vast amount of mismanagement both among you and us (you, members of the O.
C.
, should not think only of yourselves, you “organise” the whole Party), and we must think out not pia desideria, but prac-tical, firm, “first steps”.
I have expressed my views to you frankly and I should be very glad of a further exchange of letters with you.
Really and truly, you ought to write more often and in more detail on such questions.
I have nothing against this letter being communicated to the whole O.
C.
, I should even welcome it, but I leave the decision to you.
You did well to mention to whom your letter was addressed.
All the best.
Moderate your demands and hurry, hurry, hurry with the “potent remedy”.
Best regards.
Yours, Lenin Written later than May 2 2 , 1 9 0 3 Sent from Geneva to Kiev First published in 1 9 2 8 Printed from the original62 TO ALEXANDRA KALMYKOVA 201 September 7, 1903 I have just received your letter and hasten to reply.
Yes, I see that you are already well informed and that the sum of the information that makes you so is tinctured— as well it would be—a definite colour.
I understand also that what has happened is bound to worry you.
But it is one thing to know and another to understand, as you justly write, and I am deeply convinced that it is impossible to understand what has happened from the stand-point of “the effect of a nervous breakdown”.
A nervous breakdown could only give rise to sharp animosity, fury and a reckless attitude to results, but the results them-selves are utterly inescapable and their advent has long been merely a question of time.
“Riffraff” and “praetorians”—you say.
That is not the case.
The political alignment was im Grossen und Ganzen as follows: five Bundists, three Rabocheye Dyelo-ists, four Yuzhny Rabochy-ists, six from the “Marsh” or indecisives, nine Iskrists of the soft line (or Zickzackkurs) and twenty-four Iskrists of the firm line; these are voting members, and, of course, approximate.
There have been cases when everything was mixed up differently, but à vol d’oiseau this, on the whole, was how the groups worked out.
The biggest shuffle (over equality of languages), when many Iskrists vacillated, left us with not less than 23 (out of a total of 33 Iskrists) and even among these 23 the “Martovites” were in a minority.
And do you know the result of the vote at the meeting of the 16? Sixteen members of the Iskra organisation, and not “riffraff” nor “praetorians”? Do you know that here, too, Martov was in the minority both on the question of the person who had been the apple of discord and on the question of lists?The minority of Iskrists of the soft or zigzag line defeated the majority (on the question of the Rules, and more than once) by a coalition of the Bund & the Marsh & the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists.
And when the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo withdrew, the majority of the Iskrists had their own back.
Voilà tout.
And not a single person has any doubt that, if the Bund had not withdrawn, Martov would have beaten us over the central bodies.
And to make such a finale a reason for resentment, offence, a split in the Party! It is madness.
The story goes that the “praetorians” ousted people because of a slanderous accusation of opportunism, that they cast slurs on and removed active people, etc.
That is mere idle talk, the fruit of an imaginary grievance, rien de plus.
No one, absolutely no one had “slurs” cast upon him or was removed, prevented from taking part in the work.
Some one or other was merely removed from the central body—is that a matter for offence? Should the Party be torn apart for that? Should a theory of hypercentralism be constructed on that account? Should there be talk of rule by a rod of iron, etc.
, on that account? Never for a moment have I doubted or been capable of doubting that a trio of editors is the sole genuinely business-like trio, which does not break up anything, but adapts the old “family” collegium to the role of someone in an official capacity.
It is precisely the family character of the Six that has been tormenting us all these three years, as you know only too well, and from the moment Iskra became the Party and the Party became Iskra, we had to, were obliged to, break with the Six and its family character.
It was for this reason that already prior to the Congress I declared that I was going to demand freedom of election of the editorial board—or the trio— which is the sole basis also for sensible co-optation.
The break with the “family character” was absolutely essential and I am confident the Six would have peacefully accepted this trio but for the accompanying squabbles over §1 and over the C.
C.
It is only these squabbles that in their eyes painted the trio in this “horrible”, absolutely false hue.
There is nothing “horrible” in it at all, and it was essential to impose a restraint on the Zickzackkurs, and the majority of the Iskrists (both at the Congress and within the Iskra organisation) understood this perfectly well.
No, I repeat, the finale is not an “unforeseen calamity”, it is not a “division of the whole”.
That is untrue.
It is untrue that one can curse the day of “promotion”—or all our old work would remain for ever a torment of Tantalus.
And in the Party, on its formal basis, with subordination of everything to the Rules * (over which we quarrelled des-perately not without reason, quarrelled over every trifle with Martov, who beat us on this point), in such a Party the old family editorial board (not once in three years—this is a fact—did it meet with the full number of six members) was impossible, the more so because the non-Iskrists entered the Party in a bunch by right, on formal grounds.
And this called for a firm and consistent line, and not a zig-zag policy.
There is no returning to the old, and only a disordered imagination can picture Martov being led to the slaughter instead of to joint work with comrades, of whom each has his shade of the political line.
Actually, I would add, this trio, throughout these three years, in 99 cases out of a hundred, had always been the decisive, politically de-cisive (and not literary) central body.
Now, after Martov beat the majority of the Iskrists by alliance with the Bund and made every preparation for beating them by this alliance on the question of the central bodies as well, I find “their” complaints about riffraff and praetorians, their laments about the “crystal” of Iskra’s editorial board ludicrous.
He beat them by an alliance, I say, and not by a deal; I would not think of accusing them of a deal with the Marsh and the Bund, nothing of the sort.
When “they” talk about “defamatory rumours” (of being allies of the Bundists) being spread against them, “they” are repeating their usual mistake of confusing the personal and the political.
A deal would be personally ugly.
The alliance did not depend on their will, their alliance was caused by their mistake; it was not they who went with the Bund & the Marsh, but the Bund & the Marsh & Yuzhny Ra-bochy, etc.
, who followed them, having grasped at once which of the Iskrists had to be supported from the anti-Iskrist standpoint.
The Bund & the Marsh, etc.
, only * That is why “arrangements among ourselves” are impossible now, absolutely impossible, both judicially and morally.
revealed politically Martov’s organisational and tactical mistake.
For one who knows all the facts of the Congress and especially the distribution of Iskrist votes (both at the Con-gress and in the underground organisation of Iskra) there cannot be any doubt that there is no going back.
The Iskrists have parted company, but Iskra could not exist apart from the Iskrists.
And, I repeat, among the Iskrists Martov was definitely in a minority, and a split in the Party (towards which Martov is fatally heading, more and more each day) will be a revolt of the minority, a minority that is in the wrong both juridically and still more in all essentials.
We “cast slurs” neither on Martov nor on anyone else for their mistake, but call all of them to the work.
As regards the “material means” of which you speak, we are hard up just now, it goes without saying, and the Californian 202 sources have gone up in smoke.
But, if it came to that, we could endure even extreme need, so long as all the work of many years is not allowed to be wrecked through dissatisfaction with the composition of the central bodies (for objectively “their” dissatisfaction amounts only to this).
“Must the bucket too be shared?” 203 you ask.
I could hardly answer this question, for I make no claim to impar-tiality in “sharing”, and you do not need an answer that is not impartial.
I am convinced that there are no “fraction-al parts”, but there is a senseless attempt to break to pieces, smash and scatter the whole (to build a new hearth, as you put it) owing to defeat on a single question where the defeated Iskrists were utterly wrong.
All the best.

POTRESOV To Alex.
Nikolayevich September 13, 1903 I tried to have a talk with Y.
O.
recently, when the atmosphere of the impending split; was already in full evi-dence, and I want to try to have a talk with you too, in the hope that you, like Y.
O.
, would not be averse to making an attempt at explanation.
If this hope is unfounded, you will, of course, let me know, but meanwhile I shall do what I consider necessary.
The refusal of Martov to serve on the editorial board, his refusal and that of other Party writers to collaborate, the refusal of a number of persons to work for the Central Committee, and the propaganda of a boycott or passive resistance are bound to lead, even if against the wishes of Martov and his friends, to a split in the Party.
Even if Martov adheres to a loyal stand (which he took up so resolutely at the Congress), others will not, and the out-come I have mentioned will be inevitable.
(Not for noth-ing, by the way, does Auntie, too, write about “building a new hearth”.
) And so I ask myself: over what, in point of fact, would we be parting company as enemies for life? I go over all the events and impressions of the Congress, 204 I realise that I often behaved and acted in a state of frightful irrita-tion, “frenziedly”; I am quite willing to admit this fault of mine to anyone, if that can be called a fault which was a natural product of the atmosphere, the reactions, the in-terjections, the struggle, etc.
But examining now, quite unfrenziedly, the results attained, the outcome achieved by frenzied struggle, I can detect nothing, absolutely noth-ing in these results that is injurious to the Party, and abso-lutely nothing that is an affront or insult to the Minority.
Of course, the very fact of finding oneself in the minority could not but be vexatious, but I categorically protest against the idea that we “cast slurs” on anybody, that we wanted to insult or humiliate anybody.
Nothing of the kind.
And one should not allow political differences to lead to an in-terpretation of events based on accusing the other side of unscrupulousness, chicanery, intrigue and other pleasantries we are hearing mentioned more and more often in this at-mosphere of an impending split.
This should not be allowed, for it is, to say the least, the nec plus ultra of irrationality.
Martov and I have had a political (and organisational) difference, as we had dozens of times before.
Defeated over § 1 of the Rules, I could not but strive with all my might for revanche in what remained to me (and to the Congress).
I could not but strive, on the one hand, for a strictly Iskrist Central Committee, and, on the other, for a trio on the editorial board that would remove the very cause of our old, hopeless quarrels, that would unite per-sons of whom each has his own political line, of whom each makes decisions and will always make decisions “with-out regard for persons” and in keeping with his own ex-treme conviction.
I said (during our conversation with you and Y.
O.
about the trio before the Congress) that I regarded the inclusion in the Six of an absentee member 205 as most harmful of all for the work; I also took exception at the time, very strong exception, to Zasulich’s highly personal attitude (although Y.
O.
has forgotten it); I said quite definitely (when you named the most probable elected trio) that I too considered it the most probable and that even if it remained alone, without going in for any co-optation (al-though at the time we mentioned one of the possible co-optations), I saw nothing bad in that.
Yuli Osipovich has forgotten this last statement of mine too, but I remem-ber it very well.
But it is, of course, useless to argue about this.
That is not important; what is important is that with such a trio not one of those painful, long-drawn-out, hope-less quarrels with which we began the work of Iskra in 1900 and which were often repeated, making it impossible forus to work for months on end—not a single one of such quar-rels would be possible.
That is why I consider this trio the only business-like arrangement, the only one capable of being an official institution, instead of a body based on indulgence and slackness, the only one to be a real centre, each member of which, I repeat, would always state and defend his Party viewpoint, not one grain more, and ir-respective of all personal motives, all considerations con-cerning grievances, resignations, and so on.
This trio, after what had occurred at the Congress, un-doubtedly meant legitimising a political and organisational line in one respect directed against Martov.
Undoubtedly.
Cause a rupture on that account? Break up the Party be-cause of it? Did not Martov and Plekhanov oppose me over the question of demonstrations? And did not Martov and I oppose Plekhanov over the question of the programme? Is not one side of every trio always up against the other two? If the majority of the Iskrists, both in the Iskra organisa-tion and at the Congress, found this particular shade of Martov’s line organisationally and politically mistaken, is it not really senseless to attempt to attribute this to “intrigue”, “incitement”, and so forth? Would it not be senseless to try to talk away this fact by abusing the Major-ity and calling them “riffraff”? I repeat that, like the majority of the Iskrists at the Congress, I am profoundly convinced that the line Martov adopted was wrong, and that he had to be corrected.
To take offence at this correction, to regard it as an insult, etc.
, is unreasonable.
We have not cast, and are not casting, any “slurs” on anyone, nor are we excluding anyone from work.
And to cause a split because someone has been exclud-ed from a central body seems to me a piece of inconceivable folly.

Let him write to Yegor, making a last appeal to reason.
Let Zarin go and see Yegor immediately, after obtaining authority (full authority) to decide matters in Yegor’s countries.
Arrange all this with strict precision.
You must act formally and, as regards the Yegors, 206 you must prepare for a decisive war, and see to it at all costs that any attempt of theirs to get into the committees meets with a prompt and vigorous rebuff.
You must be on your guard about this and prepare all the committees.
All the Yegors are carrying out and extending the boycott; they are devilishly embit-tered, they have dreamed up a heap of imaginary grievances and insults, they imagine that they are rescuing the Party from tyrants, they are shouting about this left and right, they are stirring people up.
Their dissension has already deprived us (I don’t know for how long, possibly even forever) of two of our largest sources of money.
Please make the most desperate efforts to obtain money—that is the chief thing.
And so, don’t let Smith look on Yegor in the old way.
Friendship is at an end here.
Down with all softness! Pre-pare for the most vigorous resistance, send Zarin at once, nominate candidates (in the event of Smith’s death * ), and in the same event prepare Smith, too, for a trip “to Yegor”,** appoint members to the Council, 207 put everything on a very formal footing and exert yourself to the utmost.
We shall cope with the matter of literature.
We are putting strong hopes on Vadim.

Printed from the original65 TO ALEXANDRA KALMYKOVA September 30 You write: “I have lived too long in the world not to know that in such cases truth is not on one side alone, but on both sides.
” I fully admit it.
The trouble is that the other “side” does not realise the new situation, the new basis, and demands what used to be easily arrived at (if only after months of quarrelling), but is now unachievable.
The basis has become different, that is a fait accompli; but they are still guided chiefly by the offensive turn this or that thing took at the Congress, by the frenzied way Lenin behaved, etc.
I did act frenziedly, there is no denying it, and I frankly admitted as much in a letter to Old Be-liever.
* But the thing is that the results achieved by “fren-zied” struggle are not frenzied at all, yet the other side in its fight against frenzy goes on fighting against the results themselves, against the inevitable and necessary results.
But you have long been aware of the direction in which things were going.
You know how you expressed your firm conviction of an obstacle due to certain “old men”, and you, of course, will not doubt that the ill-fated “trio” is not a dirty trick, not a Jacobin coup, but a straight-forward, natural and the best, really and truly the best, way out from three years of “wrangling”.
The trio is a triangular construction and there is no room whatever for wrangling in it.
You know what the sensitivity and “per-sonal” (instead of political) attitude of Martov & Old Be-liever & Zasulich led to when, for example, they all but * See pp.
164-66 of this volume.
—Ed.
“condemned” a man politically for an incident of a purely personal character.
At that time, without a moment’s hesi-tation, you sided with the “flayers and monsters”.
Yet this is quite a typical case.
Now, too, the root is the same, the same mixing of the personal and the political, the same suspicion that we want to cast a slur on people personally, although we only set them aside (or shift them) politically.
And when you remind me: blame must also fall on you, I reply: I would not think of denying the personal aspect, but that is no reason for demanding a political correction.
The hopelessness, the complete hopelessness, of the situa-tion lies precisely in the fact that a political correction is being demanded on account of the sum total of personal grievances, of personal dissatisfactions with the compo-sition of the central bodies.
Tout ce que vous voulez, mais pas de ça * ! And if political divergence (as some desire) should be considered the cause, is it not ridiculous to de-mand for the sake of “peace” the co-optation of a larger number, or at least an equal number, of political opponents? It is ridiculous nec plus ultra! The little example quoted by me above out of a large number of cases of wrangling is typical not only in sub-stance but also in the form of the outcome.
Do you know how we won the upper hand at that time? We were in the minority, but we won by sheer persistence, by threatening to bring everything into the open.
They think they can do the same now.
The trouble is that now is not then.
Now the formal basis is unremovable.
If it were not for this formal basis—why shouldn’t there be six, once people have been roused to fury? We’ve stood three years of it, we can stand another three; we decided not by votes, but by persistence, so let us decide by persistence now too.
But the thing is—it can’t be done now.
Yet people dog-gedly refuse to see or understand this change.
And this is what makes the situation so hopeless.
Now the dilemma is inexorable: either the divergence is over the question of persons, in which case it is ridiculous to make a political scandal and throw up work on account of it.
Or the diver-* Anything but that!—Ed.
gence is political—and then it is still more ridiculous to “correct” this by imposing definite persons of a different, shall we say, nuance.
They are taking (seem to be taking) the second course.
In that case, join the trio, Martov, and prove before the Party the mistakes of the two in your collegium; unless you participate in the collegium you cannot obtain data for exposing these mistakes and putting the Party on its guard against them.
Otherwise your accusations are empty Parteiklatsch * over some future contingency.
If you take the first course, then don’t stretch your re-sentment to the extent of throwing up the work, and the work will speedily cause “frenzy” to be forgotten.
There is no more hopeless blind alley than that of throwing up one’s work.

P.
To the Odessa Committee October 1, 1903 Dear comrades, We too sincerely regret that a difference of opinion has arisen between the Odessa Committee and Iskra on the subject of factory stewards.
208 Our delay in replying to the letter of the Odessa Committee was due mainly to the fact that the editors were absent at the time.
Generally speaking, the obstacle in this case (strange as it may seem) was the Second Congress of the Party.
As regards the essence of the matter, incidentally, a resolution was adopted at the Congress recommending par-ticipation in the election of factory stewards.
[Quote the text: resolution No.
8.
] This resolution was passed by a huge majority, and we think that matters can be put right, although it will take time.
The Odessa Committee should immediately dissem-inate (without publishing) the text of this resolution among all organised workers and explain it to them.
Later, when the resolution is published, it would be desirable for a leaflet to be issued over the signature of the Odessa Com-mittee setting out the Party view on the question and call-ing on the workers to follow the tactics approved by the whole Party.
As regards the substance of the matter, we find that constant agitation in connection with the election of stewards would have a much greater educational and organis-ing significance than agitation carried out once only—in connection with refusal to elect.
And your own reports about patriarchal methods confirm this, pointing to theneed for a constant struggle against espionage laws and methods of spying.
We fully concur with your desire for a more frequent exchange of opinions so as to avoid differences of opinion and contradictory statements in agitation.
Write more often, not only for the press, and see to it that addresses (for letters to you) are effective regularly.
We shall try to write a leaflet on the connection be-tween the economic and the political struggle, if only other work does not interfere.
We are publishing the manifesto of Rabochaya Volya 209 in full, as you desired.

Comrade, The editorial board of the Central Organ Considers it its duty officially to express its regret at your refusal to participate in Iskra and Zarya (at present Zarya No.
5 is being prepared for the press).
In spite of the numerous invitations to co-operate which we made immediately after the Second Party Congress, before Iskra No.
46, and which we repeated several times after that, we have not received a single literary item from you.
What is more, even the publication of the second edition of your pamphlet The Red Flag has been held up for many weeks owing to non-delivery of the end of the manuscript.
The editorial board of the Central Organ states that it considers that your refusal to co-operate has not been caused by any action on its part.
No element of personal irritation, of course, should be allowed to hinder work in the Central Organ of the Party.
If, however, your withdrawal is due to any divergence between your views and ours, we would consider a detailed exposition of such differences extremely useful in the interests of the Party.
Moreover, we would consider it highly desir-able that the nature and extent of these differences should be made clear to the whole Party as soon as possible through the pages of the publications edited by us.
Finally, for the sake of the cause, we once again bring to your notice that at the present time we are ready to co-opt you as a member of the editorial board of the CentralOrgan so as to give you every opportunity to officially state and defend all your views in the highest Party insti-tution.

LEITEISEN October 10, 1903 Dear Leiteisen, I received your letter and, in accordance with your re-quest, I am replying at once.
Whether there will be a con-gress and when, I do not know.
I have heard that a major-ity of the three members of the League’s board of manage-ment here pronounced against a congress and that it was decided to invite the opinion of the two absent members: you and Vecheslov; thus a settlement of the question has been postponed.
As far as I am concerned, I am personally against a con-gress.
You think that the League ought to express itself and that a split in it is inevitable in any case; that two active militant sections would be better than a united inactive League.
The point is, however, that a split in the League is not only inevitable, but is already an almost accomplished fact; two active militant sections have already been formed and until a split in the Party occurs these militant sections will inevitably remain in the united League.
On the other hand, the Party Congress has completely upset the whole organisational basis of the League: its old Rules, which are well known to you, will, of course, in effect cease to exist after the Party Congress.
The League must be renovated and it will, of course, be rebuilt on new lines by the Central Committee of the Party, which is charged with organising the Party committees and, in gen-eral, all Party institutions.
Consequently, one may say, it is left for the congress to come together in order to part company.
To part companyin two senses: in the sense of the mutual recrimination between us and the Martovites, and in the sense of the liquidation of the old League.
Is it worth while coming together for this purpose? You will not cure the “split” (or, rather, the sulky withdrawal) in this way, but only still further embitter the two sides.
What is the use of that? What is the use of a pageant of speeches when it is already almost certain that about thirty-five of the total forty members of the League have already taken up their positions? Is the idea—to stage a “dress rehearsal”? i.
e.
, to see ap-proximately how we shall fight if it comes to a split in the Party? I cannot deny this significance of a congress, but such a game is not worth the candle.
The alignment of the remaining five (or about five) mem-bers of the League can be ascertained in a much easier way.
The League’s work abroad will in any case proceed on new lines worked out by the Party’s Central Committee.
A League Congress now will generate more heat than light, i.
e.
, it will contribute nothing to the work abroad.
I was very glad to learn that you are coming here and that we shall meet.
Let me know in good time because I am still intending to go away on holiday for three or four days.
I am swamped with work.
All the very best.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY To Claire Dear friend, I was very pleased to receive your latest news about the plan to take the skin off * Deer—it is high time! On the other hand, it is evident from letters that Deer and Vadim do not have a correct idea of the situation, and that there is no mutual understanding between us.
This is very regrettable (even if Vadim’s last letter giving advice in the form of an ultimatum is not to be taken seriously— Stake himself will reply to this, for, I repeat, I find it dif-ficult to take such a thing seriously).
Co-optation of De-mon, Falcon, etc.
, is an erroneous step, in my opinion, for these people lack experience and self-dependence.
The division of functions, too, is very dangerous, for it threat-ens to produce fragmentation.
Meanwhile the committees continue to be neglected: in Kiev people are behaving fool-ishly and, strange to relate, neither Andreyevsky, nor Dya-din, nor Lebedev, have gone into the committees to fight.
Kharkov, Ekaterinoslav, Don, and Gornozavodsky, too, are in the hands of the mutineers.
** Positions must be occupied everywhere by our people at all costs.
We must get at least one of our people, one who is wholly ours, on every committee without fail.
The Caucasus is beginning to be stirred up 211 —there, too, they need our people’s help.
More important than a division of functions is for seats in each committee to be occupied by our agents, and then for all efforts to be devoted to transport and delivery.
* Meaning to place him in an illegal position.
—Ed.
** Meaning the Mensheviks.
—Ed.
When all is said and done, the most important thing, and our whole strength, lies in transport.
We should not be content with one route alone, but have two or three, so as to put a stop to the continual interruptions.
It is extremely important to issue the announcement 212 as soon as possible, to issue it in Russia and distribute it everywhere.
For heaven’s sake, hurry up with this and write to us about it quickly and precisely.
Brutus should be formally elected to the Council and his vote formally transferred to Stake.
This is a matter that brooks no delay.
In my view, it is extremely important that Deer should be sent here if only for a couple of weeks, or even a week.
This would be very, very useful, giving a view of every-thing à vol d’oiseau, enabling him to see the source of ferment and to achieve full mutual understanding.
Surely, no one can grudge a mere 200 rubles and two or three weeks for the sake of this! Surely a legal foreign passport could be found for Deer! Think this over carefully.
I strongly recom-mend this step, which is especially convenient in connec-tion with Deer’s plans.
Truly, without having reached full agreement it is difficult to keep in step.
And Deer’s talk of “moral influence on the Old Man” shows (please don’t take offence!) the utmost lack of mutual under-standing.
Why doesn’t Deer write anything about this? The plan of co-opting Martov is simply ridiculous; it shows such a lack of understanding that there are cer-tain to be instances when you will get into a mess, and with a scandal at that.
No really, I can’t even speak seriously about your co-opting Martov; if you have been thinking of it seriously, then we speak different tongues! We have all (including Stake) laughed until we cried over this “plan”!!

To the Caucasus Dear comrades, We have had news of your affairs both from Ruben in person and from Rashid-Bek by letter.
We can only wel-come your decision to remove Isari 213 temporarily, until the matter is examined by the Central Committee.
The sum total of information concerning his behaviour at the Con-gress certainly points against him.
The Congress showed his utter instability; after some waverings, Isari, never-theless, at the decisive moment voted with the Majority and helped to secure adoption of the present composition of the editorial board of the Central Organ and of the Central Committee.
But afterwards Isari suddenly went over to the other side, and is now fighting against the decisions of the Majority by methods that are hardly loyal! It’s simply disgusting! Such a leader is not worthy of political trust.
In any case, he should be treated with caution, to say the least, and should not be given any responsible posts—such is our deep conviction, both mine (Lenin’s) and Plekha-nov’s.
Let the Caucasian comrades hold firmly to the course they have adopted.
Let them turn a deaf ear to the slander against the Majority.
The full minutes of the Congress will soon see the light of day and then things will be clear to all.
Let them carry on their good teamwork with comradely faith in the Central Committee, and we are sure that the present “dissension” in the Party will be rapidly dispelled.
We are giving much thought now to the idea of organis-ing here the publication of Georgian and Armenian litera-ture.
Competent comrades have taken this in hand, and we hope to raise the money.
We need both literary and financial help.
We send greetings to the Caucasian comrades and ardent wishes for success in their work.

Departure —where to? Do you mean by this that someone has been removed from work, or has removed himself, for some reason or other, and for what reasons precisely? 3) What is it you call “abnormal conditions at elections”? 4) Who exact-ly, in your opinion, should be co-opted on to the Central Committee? and 5) who exactly on to the editorial board of the Central Organ?

Martov, The Struggle Against the “State of Siege” Within the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, Geneva Printed from the text of the book72 TO THE MINING AND METALLURGICAL WORKERS’ UNION Comrades, We have received your resolution 215 and ask you to reply to the following questions.
Please discuss them at a general meeting of all the members of the Committee (or send them to all the members, if they are not together) as an enquiry from the editorial board of the Party’s Central Organ.
1) Has the Committee heard a report from the represen-tative of the Majority at the Party Congress? 2) Does the Committee consider it normal to pass a re-solution appraising the activities and decisions of the Con-gress before the minutes have been issued, and even before the Committee has enquired of the Central Committee or mem-bers of the Majority about matters which are not clear to it? 3) How could these disagreements on organisational ques-tions destroy everything previously done by Iskra and the Organising Committee? How did the destruction manifest itself? What exactly was destroyed? We are not at all clear on this, and if you want to safeguard the Central Organ from any kind of error, it is your duty to explain to us what you regard as our error.
Set the matter out in full detail and we shall carefully discuss your opinion.
4) What exactly are the “sharp disagreements on organi-sational questions”? We do not know.
(We asked Martov and the former members of Iskra’s editorial board to ex-pound these disagreements in the pages of the publications edited by us, but so far our request has not been complied with.
* * See pp.
173-74 of this volume.

5) In what do you see the atmosphere of political intrigue and distrust? On the part of whom? Be more explicit.
(If we distrusted Martov we would not have invited him to work in Iskra.
) 6) If there really are “sharp disagreements on organisa-tional questions” between us and the former editors, how can the two of us co-opt the four of them? That surely would mean making their tendency the dominant one? But the Congress pronounced in our favour, didn’t it? What you want, therefore, is that the decision of the Congress should be revised on the basis of a private agreement.
7) Do you consider it normal that by threats of a split, boycott, etc.
, people should want to make Party officials (editors of the Central Organ, and the Central Committee) do something that these central bodies do not consider useful in the interests of the Party? 8) Do you consider it normal and permissible that Party members who have been left in a minority should abstain from work in the Central Organ, from supporting the Cen-tral Committee and obeying it, from helping the Party financially, and so forth?

PLEKHANOV November 1, 1903 Dear Georgi Valentinovich, I am quite unable to calm down on account of the ques-tions that are worrying us.
This delay, this postponement of a decision, is simply dreadful, a torture.
.
.
.
No, really, I can quite understand your motives and considerations in favour of a concession to the Martovites.
But I am deeply convinced that a concession at the present time is the most desperate step, leading to a storm and a shindy far more certainly than would war against the Mar-tovites.
This is no paradox.
I not only did not persuade Kurtz to leave but, on the contrary, tried to persuade him to stay, but he (and Ru) flatly refuses now to work with the Martovite editorial board.
What’s going to happen? In Russia, dozens of delegates have been travelling all over; even from Nizhni-Novgorod they write that much has been done by the C.
C.
, transport has been arranged, agents have been appointed, the announcement is being published, Sokolovsky in the west, Berg in the centre, and Zemlyachka and lots of others, have all settled down to work.
And now comes the refusal of Kurtz.
It means a long break (in the session and meeting of the whole C.
C.
, now, it seems, already considerably enlarged).
Afterwards, either a struggle of the C.
C.
against the Martovite editorial board or the resignation of the whole C.
C.
Then you & two Marto-vites in the Council must co-opt a new C.
C.
, and this without election by the Congress, with total disapproval on the part of the great bulk in Russia, and bewilderment, dis-content and refusal on the part of these agents who have already gone out.
Why, this will utterly discredit the Con-gress and sow complete discord and cause a scandal in Russia a hundred thousand times more terrible and dan-gerous than a scurrilous foreign pamphlet.
We are fed up with discord! That is what they write and scream about in letters from Russia.
And to give way to the Martovites now would mean legitimising discord in Russia, for in Russia there has not yet been even a trace of disobedience and revolt.
No statements of yours or mine will now restrain the delegates of the Majority at the Party Congress.
These delegates will create a frightful rumpus.
For the sake of unity, for the sake of the stability of the Party—do not take this responsibility upon yourself, do not withdraw and do not give everything away to the Martovites.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY Dear friend, You cannot imagine what is going on here—it’s simply disgusting—and I beg you to do everything possible and impossible to come here together with Boris, after obtaining the votes of the others.
You know that I am now fairly experienced in Party matters, and I categorically declare that any postponement, the slightest delay or vacillation, will spell ruin to the Party.
You will probably be told about everything in detail.
The gist of it is that Plekhanov has suddenly changed front, after the rows at the League Con-gress, 216 and has thereby cruelly and shamefully let down me, Kurtz and all of us.
Now he has gone, without us, to haggle with the Martovites who, seeing that he was fright-ened of a split, double and quadruple their demands.
They demand not only the Six, but also the entry of their people into the C.
C.
(they do not say as yet how many and whom) and of two of them into the Council, and a disavowal of the activities of the C.
C.
in the League (activities carried out with the full agreement of Plekhanov).
Plekhanov was pitifully scared of a split and a struggle! The situation is desperate, our enemies are rejoicing and have grown in-solent, all our people are furious.
Plekhanov is threatening to throw the whole thing up immediately and is capable of doing so.
I repeat, your coming is essential at all costs.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY November 5 1) Yesterday Lalayants set out to visit you.
2) I already wrote yesterday about the row here and that Plekhanov has taken fright and entered into negotia-tions with them.
* They put forward the conditions: 1) res-toration of the old editorial board, 2) co-optation of several persons on to the Central Committee, 3) two votes in the Council, 4) recognition of the League Congress as lawful.
In other words, they agree to peace only on condition of complete surrender of the position, disavowal of Wolf and rendering the present Central Committee “harmless”.
My personal opinion is that any concessions on the part of the C.
C.
would be degrading and would completely discredit the present Central Committee.
It is necessary that Deer and Nil come here as soon as possible, everything is at stake—and if the C.
C.
is not prepared for a determined struggle, a fight to the bitter end, it would be best to give up everything to them at once.
To permit such demorali-sation, to enter into such deals, means to ruin everything.
I repeat, that is my personal opinion.
In any case, come here at once so that we may jointly decide what to do.

PLEKHANOV November 6, 1903 Georgi Valentinovich, I have given much thought to your statement of yester-day that you will reserve for yourself “full freedom of ac-tion” if I do not agree to advise Konyagin to resign from the Party Council.
I am quite unable to agree to this.
Nor do I consider it possible to remain any longer in the unof-ficial position of de facto editor in spite of my resignation, since you say that full freedom of action as understood by you does not exclude your handing over the editorial board to the Martovites.
I am compelled, therefore, to hand over to you all the official contacts of the editorial board of the Central Organ and all documents, which I am sending you under special cover.
If any explanations are required in regard to the documents, I shall, of course, willingly give them.
Some of the material has been given to con-tributors (Lebedev, Schwarz, Ruben), who will have to be told of everything being transferred to you.
N.
Lenin P.
S.
Please do not interpret the turnover of the editorial board in the sense of the notorious boycott.
That would contradict what I said plainly in my statement to you of November 1 of this year.

To Smith Dear friend, Once more I earnestly beg you to come here, you in par-ticular, and another one or two persons from the Central Committee.
This is absolutely and immediately necessary.
Plekhanov has betrayed us, there is terrible bitterness in our camp; all are indignant that, because of the rows in the League, Plekhanov has allowed the decisions of the Party Congress to be revised.
I have definitely resigned from the editorial board.
Iskra may come to a stop.
The crisis is complete and terrible.
Bear in mind that I am not fighting now for the editorial board of the Central Organ, I am quite reconciled to Plekhanov setting up a five-man board without me.
But I am fighting for the C.
C.
which the Martovites, who have grown insolent after Plekhanov’s cowardly betrayal, also want to seize; they are demanding the co-optation on to it of their own people without even saying how many! The fight for the editorial board of the Central Organ has been irretrievably lost owing to Ple-khanov’s treachery.
The sole chance of peace lies in trying to give them the editorial board of the C.
O.
while holding on to the C.
C.
ourselves.
This is not at all easy (even this may be too late already), but we must try.
We need Smith here, and best of all two more Russians from the C.
C.
, the most imposing (no ladies) (e.
g.
, Boris and Doctor).
Plekhanov threatens to resign if the C.
C.
does not yield.
For heaven’s sake, don’t believe in his threats; we must use more pressure on him, scare him.
Russia must stand up firmly for the C.
C.
and content itself with handing over the editorial board of the C.
O.
New people from the C.
C.
are needed here, otherwise there is absolutely no one to conduct negotiations with the Mar-tovites.
Smith is triply needed.
I repeat the Martovites’ “conditions”: 1) negotiations on behalf of the editorial board of the C.
O.
, and the C.
C.
, 2) six on the editorial board of the C.
O.
, 3) ? on the C.

LYADOV 219 November 10, 1903 * Dear Lidin, I should like to give you our “political news”.
To begin with, here is a chronology of recent events.
Wednesday (October 27 or 28?) was the third day of the League Congress.
Martov yelled hysterically about “the blood of the old editorial board” (Plekhanov’s expression) being upon us, and that on the part of Lenin there was something in the nature of intrigue at the Congress, etc.
I calmly challenged him in writing (by a statement to the bureau of the Congress ** ) to make his accusations against me openly before the whole Party; I would undertake to publish everything.
Otherwise, I said, it was mere Skan-dalsucht.
*** Martov, of course, “nobly withdrew”, demand-ing (as he still does) a court of arbitration; I continued to demand that he should have the courage to make his accu-sations openly, otherwise I would ignore it all as pitiful tittle-tattle.
Plekhanov refused to speak in view of Martov’s discredit-able behaviour.
Some dozen of our people submitted a state-ment to the Congress bureau, branding Martov’s “discre-ditable behaviour” in reducing the dispute to the level of squabbling, suspicions, etc.
I would remark in parenthesis that my two hours’ speech about “Comrade Martov’s histor-* The letter bears Lenin’s note: “unmailed”.
—Ed.
** “Statement Concerning Martov’s Report” (see present edition, Vol.
7).
—Ed.
*** Mania for provoking a row.
—Ed.
ical turn” * at the Party Congress towards Versumpfung ** did not evoke even from the Martovites a single protest about the issue being reduced to the level of squabbling.
Friday.
We decided to introduce eleven new members into the League.
In the evening at a private meeting with these “grenadiers” (as we jokingly called them), Plekhanov rehearsed all the steps by which we should utterly rout the Martovites.
A stage scene.
Thunderous applause.
Saturday.
The C.
C.
read its statement about not endors-ing the League’s Rules and about the meeting being un-lawful (a statement previously discussed with Plekhanov in all details, word by word).
All our people walked out amid the Martovites’ cries of “gendarmes” and so forth.
Saturday evening.
Plekhanov “surrendered”.
He did not want a split.
He demanded the opening of peace negotia-tions.
Sunday (November 1).
I tendered my resignation in writing to Plekhanov (not wishing to be a party to such depravity as the revision of the Party Congress under the influence of a row abroad; to say nothing of the fact that from the purely strategical aspect a more stupid moment for concessions could not have been chosen).
*** November 3.
Old Believer gave Plekhanov, who began the negotiations, a written statement of the conditions of peace with the opposition: 1) Negotiations to be con-ducted by the editorial board of the C.
O.
and by the C.
C.
2) Restoration of the old editorial board of Iskra.
3) Co-optation on to the C.
C.
, the number to be decided during the negotiations.
Cessation of co-optation on to the C.
C.
from the moment negotiations begin.
4) Two seats (sic!) on the Party Council and 5) recognition of the lawfulness of the League Congress.
Plekhanov was not put out.
He demanded that the C.
C.
give way (!).
The C.
C.
refused and wrote to Russia.
Ple-khanov declared that he would resign if the C.
C.
did not give way.
I turned over to Plekhanov (November 6) all editorial matters, convinced that Plekhanov was capable * “Report on the Second Congress of the R.

of surrendering to the Martovites not merely the newspaper but the entire C.
C.
for nothing.
* The state of affairs: Iskra would hardly come out on time.
The Martovites were rejoicing over their “victory”.
All our people (except the two Axelrod maids, 220 who are faithful to Plekhanov even in his Treulosigkeit ** ) dis-sociated themselves from Plekhanov and at a meeting (No-vember 6 or 7) told him some home truths (on the subject of the “second Isari”).
A pretty picture, is it not? I shall not join the editorial board, but I shall write.
Our people want to defend the C.
C.
, insofar as that is possible, and to continue an inten-sified agitation against the Martovites—the right plan, in my opinion.
Let Plekhanov leave us; the Party Council will then turn over Iskra to a committee and convene an Extraordi-nary Party Congress.
Do you mean to say the League Abroad will be allowed by a majority of three or four votes to revise the Party Congress? Do you mean to say it is proper, after carrying the fight to the lengths of the greatest publicity and almost a rupture, to sound the retreat and accept peace terms dictated by the Martovites? I should like to know your opinion.
I think that to act à la Plekhanov means subverting the Party Congress and betraying its majority.
I think that we must agitate with all our strength here and in Rus-sia for subordination to the Party Congress and not to the League Congress.
A boycott of Iskra (even a Martovite Iskra) is, of course, stupid.
Moreover it would be a boycott not of a Martovite but, possibly, of a Plekhanovite Iskra, for Zasulich and Axelrod will soon give Plekhanov three votes in the Five.
And that’s called an editorial board! As an illustration to your witty remark about the saintly relics of Sarovsky, I will quote the following statistical item: in the 45 issues of Iskra under six editors, there were 39 articles and feuil-letons written by Martov, 32 by me, 24 by Plekhanov, 8 by Old Believer, 6 by Zasulich, and 4 by P.
B.
Axelrod.
This * See pp.
189-90 of this volume.

** Treachery.
—Ed.
in the course of three years! Not a single issue was made up (in the sense of technical editorial work) by anyone other than Martov or myself.
And now—as a reward for the row, as a reward for Old Believer cutting off an impor-tant source of finance—they are to be taken on to the edito-rial board! They fought over “differences of principle”, which, in Old Believer’s letter of November 3 to Plekhanov were so expressively converted into figuring out how many seats they needed.
And we have to legitimise this fight for seats, to make a deal with this party of discarded gener-als or ministers (grève générale des généraux, * as Plekha-nov said) or with the party of hysterical brawlers! What’s the use of Party congresses if things are done by nepotism abroad, by hysteria and brawling? Further about the notorious “trio”, which the hysterical Martov sees as the pivot of my “intriguing”.
You prob-ably remember from as far back as the time of the Congress my programme for the Congress and my commentary on this programme.
I should very much like all Party mem-bers to know this document, and so once again I quote it for you precisely.
“Item 23 (Tagesordnung ** ).
Election of the Central Committee and the editorial board of the Central Organ of the Party.
My commentary: “The Congress shall elect three persons to the editorial board of the Central Organ and three to the Central Committee.
These six persons in conjunction shall, if necessary, co-opt by a two-thirds majority vote additional members to the editorial board of the C.
O.
and to the C.
C.
, and report to this effect to the Congress.
After the report has been endorsed by the Congress, subsequent co-optation shall be effected by the editorial board of the C.
O.
and by the C.
C.
separately.
” Is it not clear that this means renewal of the editorial board, a thing which cannot be done without the consent of the C.
C.
(four out of six are necessary for co-optation), while the question of enlarging the original trio or leaving it as it was is left open (co-optation “if necessary”)? I showed this draft to everyone (including Plekhanov, of course) * A general strike of generals.
—Ed.
** Agenda.
—Ed.
prior to the Congress.
Of course, renewal was necessary owing to dissatisfaction with the Six (and especially with Plekhanov, who in fact had the votes of P.
B.
Axelrod, who almost never took part, and of the pliable V.
I.
Za-sulich), and, of course, in a private conversation with Mar-tov, I sharply expressed this dissatisfaction, “scolded” all three—Plekhanov (especially) and Axelrod and Zasulich— for their caprices, and proposed even enlarging the Six to Seven, etc.
Is it not hysteria to give a twist now to these private conversations and raise a howl that “the trio was aimed against Plekhanov” and that I had laid a “trap” for Martov, and so forth? Of course, when we agreed with Martov, the trio would be against Plekhanov, and when Plekhanov agreed with Martov (on the subject of demon-strations, for example) then the trio would be against me, and so on.
The hysterical howling merely covers up a piti-ful incapacity to understand that the editorial board must have real, and not fictitious, editors, that it must be a business-like and not a philistine collegium, and that each of its members should have his own opinion on each question (which was never the case with the unelected trio).
Martov approved my plan of two trios, but when it turned out to be against him in one question, he went into a fit of hysteria and began to howl about intrigue! It was not for nothing that in the corridors of the League Congress Plekhanov called him a “pitiful person”! Yes .
.
.
the dirty squabble abroad—that is what over-ruled the decision of the majority of Russian Party work-ers.
Plekhanov’s betrayal, too, was partly due to fear of a row abroad, and partly to a feeling (perhaps) that in the Five he was sure to have three votes.
.
.
.
A fight for the C.
C.
, for a new congress to be held soon (in the summer)—that is what is left to us.

Dear friends, The new political situation was fully clarified after the publication of Iskra No.
53.
It is clear that the Five in the Central Organ are out to hound both Lenin (even going so far as slander about his having expelled the Yuzhny Rabochy people from the Party and vile hints about Schweitzer 221 ) and the C.
C.
, and the Majority as a whole.
Plekhanov says bluntly that the Five on the C.
O.
are not afraid of any Central Committee.
The C.
C.
is being attacked both here and in Russia (letter from St.
Petersburg about Martyn’s journey).
The issue squarely faces us.
If time is lost and we fail to give the watchword for the struggle, complete defeat is inevitable owing, firstly, to the desperate strug-gle of the Iskra Five and, secondly, to the arrests of our people in Russia.
The only salvation is—a congress.
Its watchword: the fight against disrupters.
Only by this watch-word can we catch out the Martovites, win over the broad masses and save the situation.
In my opinion, the only possible plan is this: for the time being not a word about the congress, complete secrecy.
All, absolutely all, forces to be sent into the committees and on tours.
A fight to be waged for peace, for putting a stop to disruption, for sub-ordination to the Central Committee.
Every effort to be made to strengthen the committees with our people.
Every effort to be made to catch out the Martovites and Yuzhny-Rabochy people in disruption, pin them down by documents and resolutions against the disrupters; resolutions of the committees should pour into the Central Organ.
Further, our people should be got into the wavering committees.
Winning over the committees with the watchword: againstdisruption—this is the most important task.
The congress must be held not later than January, therefore set to work energetically; we, too, shall put all forces into operation.
The object of the congress is to strengthen the C.
C.
and the Council, and perhaps the C.
O.
as well, either by a trio (in the event of our being able to tear Plekhanov away, which is not very likely), or by a Six, which I would join in the event of a peace that is honourable for us.
At the worst: their C.
O.
, our C.
C.
and Council.
I repeat: either complete defeat (the C.
O.
will hound us) or immediate preparation for a congress.
It must be pre-pared secretly at first during a maximum of one month, after which during three weeks the demands of half the com-mittees to be collected and the congress convened.
Again and yet again—this is the only salvation.
Written December 1 0 , 1 9 0 3 Sent from Geneva to Russia First published in 1 9 2 9 Printed from the original82 TO THE I S K R A EDITORIAL BOARD 222 To the Editorial Board of the Central Organ December 12, 1903 I, as representative of the C.
C.
, received today from Comrade Martov an inquiry as to whether a report on the negotiations of the C.
C.
with the Geneva opposition could be published or not.
223 I believe it could, and I earnestly request the comrades on the editorial board of the C.
O.
to consider once again the question of peace and good will in the Party.
It is not too late yet to secure such a peace, it is not too late yet to keep from our people and our enemies the details of the split and the speeches about dishonourable conduct and falsified lists, speeches which will probably be utilised even by Moskovskiye Vedomosti.
224 I can guarantee that the Majority will readily agree to consign all this dirt to oblivion, provided peace and good will in the Party are secured.
Everything now depends on the editorial board of the C.
O.
, which includes representatives of the former oppo-sition that rejected the C.
C.
’s peace proposal of November 25, 1903.
225 I ask you, comrades, to take into consideration that since then the C.
C.
has already made two further voluntary concessions, by advising Comrade Ru to hand in his resignation and by trying to settle the League affair “amicably”.
Meanwhile the boycott of the C.
C.
, the agitation against it and the disruption of practical work in Russia continue.
People write to us from Russia that the opposition are making a “hell” there.
We have the most definite infor-mation that the agents of the Minority are systematicallycontinuing their disruptive work, making a round of the committees.
People in St.
Petersburg write about Martyn’s visit there with the same aim.
Things have reached a point when the opposition are making their own transport arrange-ments and, through Dan, are offering the C.
C.
to share them on a fifty-fifty basis! I consider it my duty to the Party to ask the editorial board of the C.
O.
for the last time that it persuade the opposition to subscribe to peace and good will on the basis of a sincere recognition of the two central bodies by both sides and cessation of the intestine war which renders any joint work impossible.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY Dear friend, It is essential that we clear up in all details a question on which we apparently differ, and I beg you to forward this letter of mine for discussion by all members of the C.
C.
(or its Executive Committee 226 ).
The difference is this: 1) you think that peace with the Martovites is pos-sible (Boris even congratulates us on peace! It is both comic and tragic!); 2) you think that an immediate congress is an acknowledgement of our impotence.
I am convinced that on both points you are cruelly mistaken.
1) The Mar-tovites are heading for war.
At the meeting in Geneva, Martov bluntly shouted: “We are a force.
” They vilify us in their newspaper and basely sidetrack the issue, covering up their trickery by yelling about bureaucracy on your part.
On every hand Martov continues to clamour about the C.
C.
being absolutely ineffective.
In short, it is naïve and quite impermissible to doubt that the Martovites are out to seize the C.
C.
as well by the same methods of trick-ery, boycott and brawling.
A fight with them on this level is beyond our strength, for the C.
O.
is a powerful weapon and our defeat is inevitable, especially in view of the ar-rests.
By letting the time slip by you are heading for the certain and complete defeat of the entire Majority, you are silently swallowing the insults which the C.
C.
is suffer-ing abroad (at the hands of the League) and asking for more.
2) A congress will demonstrate our strength, will prove that not merely in words but in fact we shall not permit a clique of brawlers abroad to boss the whole movement.
It is now that a congress is needed, when the watchword is: the fight against disruption.
Only this watchword jus-tifies a congress, and justifies it completely in the eyes of Russia as a whole.
By losing this opportunity, you lose this watchword and prove your impotent, passive subordination to the Martovites.
To dream of strengthening our positions by positive work in face of the attacks on the part of the C.
O.
and the Martovites’ boycott and agitation is simply ludicrous.
It means slowly perishing in an inglorious strug-gle against the intriguers, who will say afterwards (and are already saying): see how ineffective this Central Com-mittee is! I repeat, don’t harbour any illusions.
Either you dictate peace to the Martovites at a congress, or they will kick you out ingloriously or replace you at the first setback caused by arrests.
The congress now has an aim, namely: to put an end to the intolerable disruption, to sweep away the League, which flaunts every and any C.
C.
, to take the Council firmly into its hands and put the Central Organ in order.
How to put it in order? At worst by leaving even the Five (or by restoring the Six); but this worst event is improbable if we get a big majority.
Then we shall either rout the Martovites completely (Plekhanov is beginning to talk of a new Vademecum, seeing that there is no peace, and is threatening to attack both contending sides.
That’s just what we want!), or we shall say frankly that we have no guiding C.
O.
and we shall convert it into an organ for discussion, with freedom for signed articles of the Majority and the Minority (or even better: relegate the polemic with the Martovites to pamphlets, and in Iskra fight only against the government and the enemies of Social-Democracy).
And so, abandon the naïve hope of working peacefully in such an impossible atmosphere.
Send all the main forces out on tours, let Deer travel, secure immediately the ab-solute support of your own committees, then launch an attack on those of the others, and—a congress, a congress.
not later than January! P.
S.
If Martov asks Deer concerning publication 227 — let Deer without fail transfer his vote to Stake; without fail, otherwise there will be an arch-scandal! When Martov and Dan speak to Stake at rendezvous they treat him with intolerable insolence! P.
P.
S.
Today, 18th, another dirty trick of the Marto-vites: their refusal to publish in No.
54 my letter on whyI resigned from the editorial board, * on the pretext that Hans was against publication of documents (they have become inveterate liars! Hans was against it provided there was peace!).
The refusal is accompanied by a heap of dis-gusting statements, such as that the C.
C.
has been trying to lay hands on the C.
O.
, that negotiations have gone on for restoring confidence in the C.
C.
, and so on.
The tactic is clear: hypocritically to disguise the opposition of the Dans, Martyns, etc.
, to the C.
C.
and on the sly to {ling mud at the C.
C.
in the newspaper.
On no account shall I leave the vile No.
53 unanswered.
Wire immediately: 1) do you agree to the publication of my letter outside Iskra? 203 shares; 2) do you agree to devote all efforts immediately to the congress? 204 shares.
If the answer to both questions is “yes”, then wire: 407 shares.
If it is “no” to both, then 45 shares.
The day after tomorrow I shall send you my letter of resignation from the editorial board.
If you do not agree to an immediate congress and intend to suffer Martov’s insults without saying anything, then I shall probably have to resign from the Central Committee as well.

VILONOV 228 Dear comrade, I was very glad to have your letter because here abroad we have too little opportunity of hearing the frank and independent voices of those engaged in local activities.
For a Social-Democratic writer living abroad it is extreme-ly important to have a frequent exchange of opinions with advanced workers who are active in Russia, and your ac-count of the impact our dissensions have upon the com-mittees interested me very much.
I shall, perhaps, even publish your letter if the occasion offers.
229 It is impossible to answer your questions in a single letter, since a detailed account of the Majority and the Minority would take up a whole book.
I have now published in leaflet form my “Letter to the Editors of Iskra (Why I Resigned From the Iskra Editorial Board),” * where I give a brief account of the reasons why we parted company and try to show how the matter is misrepresented in Iskra No.
53 (beginning with No.
53, the editorial board consists of four representatives of the Minority in addition to Ple-khanov).
I hope that this letter (a small printed sheet of eight pages) will soon be in your hands, because it has already been taken to Russia and it will probably not be difficult to distribute it.
I repeat: in this letter the matter is set out very briefly.
It cannot at present be set out in greater detail until the minutes of the Party Congress and of the League Congress have been issued (it is announced in Iskra No.
53 that the minutes of both these congresses will be published in full * See present edition, Vol.
7.
—Ed.
very soon.
I have information that the minutes of the Party Congress will be issued as a book of over three hundred pages; nearly 300 pages are now ready and the book will probably come out in a week or two at the latest).
Most probably a pamphlet * will have to be written when these two sets of minutes are published.
My personal view of the matter is that the split is pri-marily and mainly due to dissatisfaction with the com-position of the central bodies (the Central Organ and the Central Committee).
The Minority wanted to keep the old six-man board of the C.
O.
, but the Congress selected three of the six, apparently finding them better suited for polit-ical leadership.
The Minority was similarly defeated over the composition of the Central Committee, that is to say, the Congress did not elect those whom the Minority wanted.
In consequence of this the dissatisfied Minority began exaggerating minor differences of opinion, boycotting the central bodies, mustering its supporters and even preparing to split the Party (very persistent and, probably, trust-worthy rumours are current here that they have already decided to found, and have begun to set up, their own newspaper to be called Kramola.
** No wonder the feuille-ton in Iskra No.
53 has been set up in a type which does not exist at all in the Party print-shop!).
Plekhanov decided to co-opt them on to the editorial board to avoid a split, and wrote the article “What Should Not Be Done” in Iskra No.
52.
After No.
51, I resigned from the editorial board, for I considered this modification of the congress under the influence of the rows taking place abroad to be incorrect.
But personally, of course, I did not want to prevent peace if peace were possible, and therefore (since now I do not consider it possible for me to work in the Six) I withdrew from the editorial board, with-out, however, refusing to contribute.
The Minority (or opposition) wants to force its people into the Central Committee too.
For the sake of peace, the C.
C.
agreed to take two of them, but the Minority is still not satisfied and continues to spread vile rumours about * Lenin has in view his pamphlet One Step Forward, Two Steps Back which appeared in May 1904 (see present edition, Vol.
7).

the C.
C.
being ineffectual.
In my opinion, that is the most outrageous violation of discipline and Party duty.
More-over, it is sheer slander, for the C.
C.
was elected by the Congress from persons for whom the majority of the Iskra organisation had expressed support.
And the Iskra organi-sation, of course, knew better than anyone else who was fitted for this important role.
A Central Committee of three persons 230 was elected at the Congress—all three long-standing members of the Iskra organisation; two of them were members of the Organising Committee; the third had been invited to serve on the O.
C.
but did not do so because he was personally unwilling, yet for a long time he worked for the O.
C.
on general Party matters.
It follows that the most reliable and experienced persons were elected to the C.
C.
and I consider it a shabby trick to shout about their “ineffectiveness”, when it is the Minor-ity itself that hinders the C.
C.
from working.
All the charges against the C.
C.
(about formalism, bureaucracy, and so forth) are nothing but malicious inventions devoid of any foundation.
It goes without saying that I fully share your opinion as to the unseemliness of an outcry against centralism and against the congress on the part of people who previously spoke in a different tone and who are dissatisfied because on one particular issue the congress did not do what they wanted.
Instead of admitting their mistake, these people are now disrupting the Party! I believe, the comrades in Russia should vigorously oppose all disruption and insist that the congress decisions be implemented and prevent the squabble about who should be on the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
from hindering the work.
The squabbles abroad among the writers and all the other generals (whom you too harsh-ly and bluntly call intriguers) will cease to be dangerous to the Party only when the leaders of committees in Russia become more independent and capable of firmly demanding the fulfilment of what their delegates decide at the Party congress.
Concerning the relations between the Central Organ and the Central Committee, you are quite right that neither the one nor the other should be given the upper hand once for all.
The congress itself, I think, should make a separatedecision on each occasion.
At present, too, according to the Rules, the Party Council stands above both the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
And the Council has two members from the C.
O.
and two from the C.
C.
, the fifth member having been elected by the congress.
Hence the congress itself has decid-ed who should be given the upper hand on this occasion.
Stories about us wanting the C.
O.
abroad to overrule the C.
C.
in Russia are sheer gossip in which there is not a word of truth.
When Plekhanov and I were on the editorial board we had even in the Council three Social-Democrats from Russia and only two from abroad.
Now, under the Martovites, the reverse is the case! Now judge for yourself what their talk is worth! I send you warm greetings and earnestly request you to let me know whether you received this letter, whether you have read my letter to the editorial board and Nos.

I have read the C.

A more ridiculous misunderstanding I cannot imagine.
Hans has been cruelly punished by this for his credulity and impres-sionability.
Let him explain to me, in the name of all that’s holy, where he gets the temerity to speak in such an unctuous tone about peace when the opposition (Martov included) has formally rejected peace in the reply to the Central Committee’s ultimatum? Is it not childishness, after this formal rejection of peace, to believe the chatter of Martov who, firstly, does not remember today what he said yesterday and, secondly, cannot answer for the whole opposition? Is it not naïve to speak and write about peace when the opposition is on the war-path again, is clamour-ing at meetings in Geneva that it is a force, and is begin-ning a mean persecution in Iskra No.
53? And to tell a down-right lie to the committees!—for example, that the conflict with the League is “completely at an end”? To keep silent about the first Council (with Ru)? Finally, this silly advice that I should go away from here! I could understand if it has been given by members of the family or relatives, but for such piffle to be written by the Central Committee! Yes, it is now that the literary war begins.

Personally, I see no other way out.
Reply to the committees (and to Martov himself) that the disgracefully false article “Our Congress” has provoked a polemic in the press, but that you (the C.

December 30, 1903 We have received your letter of December 10 (old style).
We are surprised and angered by your silence on burning issues and your unpunctuality in correspondence.
It is really impossible for matters to be conducted in this fashion! Get another secretary if Bear and Doe are unable to write every week.
Just think, so far nothing substantial has been received from Deer! So far (after 20 days) there has been no reply to our letter of December 10 (new style).
* At all costs this scandalous state of affairs must be put an end to! Further, we categorically insist on the need to know where we stand in the struggle against the Martovites, on the need to reach agreement among ourselves and to adopt an absolutely definite line.
Why haven’t you sent Boris over here, as Hans here wanted? If Boris were here, he would not be writing us ridiculous speeches about peace.
Why hasn’t Hans fulfilled his promise to write to the Old Man an exact account of Boris’s mood? If you can’t send Boris, send Mitrofan or Beast in order to clear up the matter.
I repeat over and over again: Hans’s main mistake lies in having trusted to his latest impression.
No.
53 ought to have sobered him.
The Martovites have taken possession of the C.
O.
for the purpose of war, and now war is being waged all along the line: attacks in Iskra, brawling at public lectures (recently in Paris Martov read a lecture about the split to an audience of 100 and engaged in a * See pp.
200-01 of this volume.
—Ed.
fight against Lebedev), the most shameless agitation against the Central Committee.
It would be unpardonable short-sightedness to think that this could not spread to Russia.
Things here have reached a stage when the C.
O.
has broken off relations with the C.
C.
(the C.
O.
resolution of Decem-ber 22, sent to you), and when the C.
O.
has published a false statement (Iskra No.
55) alleging an agreement about non-publication of the negotiations).
It is high time you gave serious thought to the political situation as a whole, took a broader view, got away from the petty, everyday concern with pence and passports, and, without burying your head in the sand, got clear on where you are going and for the sake of what you are dilly-dallying.
There are two tendencies among us in the C.
C.
, if I am not mistaken (or, perhaps, three? What are they?).
In my opinion they are: 1) to procrastinate, without convening a congress and turning a deaf ear, as far as possible, to attacks and grossest insults, and to strengthen the position in Russia; 2) to raise a storm of resolutions against the C.
O.
, to devote all efforts to winning over the shaky com-mittees and to prepare a congress in two, or at most three, months’ time.
And so, I ask: what does your strengthening of the positions consist in? Only in your losing time, while the adversary is mustering his forces here (and the groups abroad matter a lot!), and in your putting off a decision until you suffer defeat.
Defeat is inevitable and will be fairly rapid—it would be sheer childishness to ignore that.
What will you leave us after the defeat? Among the Martovites—fresh and increased forces.
Among us—broken ranks.
For them—a strengthened Central Organ.
For us—a bunch of persons badly handling the transportation of a Central Organ that abuses them.
That is a sure path to defeat, a shameful and stupid postponement of inevitable defeat.
You are merely closing your eyes to this, taking advantage of the fact that the war abroad is slow in reach-ing you.
Your tactics literally amount to saying: after us (after the present composition of the C.
C.
), the deluge (a deluge for the Majority).
I think that even if defeat is inevitable, we must make our exit straightforwardly, honestly and openly, and thatis possible only at a congress.
But defeat is by no means inevitable, for the Five are not solid, Plekhanov is not with them, but in favour of peace, and a congress could show up both Plekhanov and them, with their supposed differences of opinion.
The only serious objection to a congress is that it will necessarily legitimise a split.
To this I reply: 1) even that is better than the present posi-tion, for then we can make our exit honestly instead of prolonging the disgraceful position of being spat upon; 2) the Martovites have missed the moment for a split, and their withdrawal from the Third Congress is improbable, for the present struggle and full publicity remove the possi-bility of a split; 3) a deal with them, if that were possible, is best of all done at the congress.
Discuss this matter seriously and send your reply at long last, giving the opinion of each (absolutely each) member of the Central Committee.
Don’t bother me about leaflets; I am not a machine and in the present scandalous situation I can’t work.

234 January 2, 1904.
I have just received the proofs of Axelrod’s article in Iskra No.
55 235 (No.
55 will be out in a couple of days).
It is much more disgusting even than Martov’s article (“Our Congress”) in No.
53.
We have here “ambitious fantasies” “inspired by the legends about Schweitzer’s dictatorship”; we have here again accusa-tions about “the all-controlling centre” “disposing at its personal (sic!) discretion” of “Party members who are converted (!) into cogs and wheels”.
“The establishment of a vast multitude of government departments, divisions, offices and workshops of all kinds.
” The conversion of revolutionaries (really and truly, sic!) “into head clerks, scribes, sergeants, non-commissioned officers, privates, warders, foremen” (sic!).
The C.
C.
, it says (according to the Majority’s idea), “must be merely the collective agent of this authority (the authority of the Iskra editorial board), and be under its strict tutelage and vigilant control”.
Such, it says, is “the organisational utopia of a theocratic nature” (sic!).
“The triumph of bureaucratic centralism in the Party organisation—that is the result” .
.
.
(really and truly, sic!).
In connection with this article I again and again ask all C.
C.
members: is it really possible to leave this without a protest or fight? Don’t you feel that by tolerating this silently you are turning yourselves into nothing more nor less than gossip-mongers (gossip about Schweitzer and his pawns) and spreaders of slander (about bureaucrats, i.
e.
, yourselves and the Majority as a whole)? And do you consider it possible to conduct “positive work” under such “ideological leadership”? Or do you know of any other means of honest struggle apart from a con-gress?((The Martovites, apparently, have Kiev, Kharkov Gornozavodsky, Rostov and the Crimea.
This makes ten votes & the League & the editorial board of the C.
O.
& two in the Council= 16 votes out of 49.
If all efforts are at once directed towards Nikolayev, Siberia and the Cauca-sus, it is fully possible to leave them with one-third.

M.
KRZHIZHANOVSKY January 4, 1904 Old Man writing.
I have just received Deer’s letter with a reply to mine of December 10 * and I am answering im-mediately.
You don’t have to ask me for a criticism of Deer’s views! I will say straight out that I am furious with Deer’s timidity and naïveté.
1) To write to the C.
O.
from the C.
C.
in Russia is the height of tactlessness.
Everything must go through the C.
C.
’s representative abroad, and no other way.
I assure you, this is essential if you want to avoid a terrific row.
The C.
O.
must be told once and for all that there is the C.
C.
’s plenipotentiary representative abroad and that’s flat.
2) It is not true that there was some sort of agreement about the League minutes.
You said plainly that you were leaving the question of publishing or shortening them to us.
(As a matter of fact there was no “agreement” for you to make on this.
Not even for the entire C.
C.
).
You are hopelessly muddled up on this, and if you were to write a single incautious word, it will all appear in the press with an immense hullabaloo.
3) If in your letter to the C.
O.
about No.
53 you did not use a single word of protest against the obscenities about Schweitzer, bureaucratic formalism, etc.
, then I am bound to say that we have ceased to understand each-other.
In that case I shall say no more and come out as a private writer against these obscenities.
In print, I shall call these gentlemen hysterical tricksters.
* See pp.
200-01 of this volume.
—Ed.
4) While the C.
C.
is muttering about positive work, Yeryoma and Martyn are stealing Nikolayev from it.
This is a downright disgrace and another warning to you, the hundredth, if not thousandth.
Either we win over the committees and convene a congress, or ignominiously retire from the scene under the hail of obscene attacks by the C.
O.
, which denies me access to Iskra.
5) To speak of a conference of the committees and of an “ultimatum” (after they have ridiculed our ultimatum!) is simply ridiculous.
Why, the Martovites will simply burst out laughing in reply to this “threat”! What do they care about ultimatums when they brazenly hold back money, attack the C.
C.
and openly say: “We await the first break-down.
” Can Deer have forgotten already that Martov is a pawn in the hands of cunning persons? And after this to still talk about the attitude of Martov and George towards Deer and Nil! It is offensive to read this naïveté.
In the first place, both Martov and George don’t care a hang about all your Deer and Nils.
Secondly, George is pushed right into the background by the Martovites and he says plainly that they don’t listen to him (which is clearly evident from Iskra).
Thirdly, I repeat for the hundredth time that Martov is a cipher.
Why didn’t that good soul Hans make friends here with Trotsky, Dan and Natalya Ivanovna? What a pity the dear fellow missed such a chance (the last chance) to make a “sincere”, “happy peace”.
.
.
.
Would it not be wiser to write letters directly to these “masters” than to weep on the neck of that rag doll, Martov? Just try and write, it will sober you up! And until you have written to them and personally received a spit in the face from them, don’t bother us (or them) about “peace”.
We here can clearly see who is doing the chattering and who the bossing among the Martovites.
6) I gave my arguments in favour of a congress already last time.
For heaven’s sake, don’t pussyfoot to yourself; postponing the congress would only be a proof of our im-potence.
And if you continue harping on peace, it will not only be Nikolayev that the enemies will take from you.
It’s either war or peace.
If peace—then it means that you are giving way to the Martovites, who are waging avigorous and clever war.
In that case you will suffer in silence while mud is being flung at you in the C.
O.
(= the ideological leadership of the Party!).
In that case we have nothing to talk about.
I have already said in the press everything there was to be said, and will go on saying everything in the full sense of the word.
It is clear to me that the hounding we feared if I were to take Iskra on my own, has started all the same, only now my mouth is stopped.
And it is childishness to rely on Andreyevsky’s talk about the influence of Lenin’s name.
If it’s war, I would ask you in that case to explain to me by what means, other than a congress, a real and honest war can be carried on.
I repeat that a congress now is not pointless, for Plekha-nov is no longer with the Martovites.
Publication (which I shall secure at all costs) 236 will finally separate him from them.
And he is already at loggerheads with them.
The Martovites will not even mention the Six at the Third Congress.
A split would be better than what we have at present, when they have dirtied Iskra with tittle-tattle.
But they will hardly seek a split at the Third Congress, and we shall be able to hand over Iskra to a neutral com-mittee, taking it away from both sides.
7) Against the League, I shall do my utmost to achieve a decisive war.
8) If Nil is still for peace, let him come and talk a couple of times with Dan.
That will be enough, I’m sure! 9) We need money.
There is enough for two months, and after that not a farthing.
Don’t forget we are now “keeping” a bunch of scoundrels, who spit on us in the C.
O.
That is called “positive work”.

Printed from the original90 TO THE I S K R A EDITORIAL BOARD 237 As the representative of the C.
C.
, I consider it necessary to point out to the editors that there are absolutely no grounds for raising the question of lawfulness, etc.
, on the basis of heated speeches at lectures or on the basis of literary polemics.
The Central Committee as such has never had, and does not have, the slightest doubt of the lawfulness of the editorial board co-opted, as Iskra No.
53 quite justly stated, in complete accord with Clause 12 of the Party Rules.
The Central Committee would be ready to state that publicly as well, if necessary.
If the editorial board sees these polemics as attacks upon itself, it has every op-portunity of replying.
It is hardly reasonable to resent what the editorial board regards as sharply worded statements in the polemic, when no mention is made anywhere of boycott or any other disloyal (from the viewpoint of the C.
C.
) form of activity.
We would remind the editorial board that the C.
C.
has repeatedly expressed its full readiness to publish, and made a direct proposal to publish, immediately both Dan’s letter and Martov’s “Once Again in the Minority”, without being at all put out by the very sharp attacks to be found in these documents.
In the view of the C.
C.
, it is essential to give all Party members the widest possible freedom to criticise the central bodies and to attack them; the C.
C.
sees nothing terrible in such attacks, provided they are not accompanied by a boycott, by standing aloof from positive work or by cutting off financial resources.
The Central Committee states even now that it would publish criticism against itself, seeing in a free exchange.

PLEKHANOV, CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY COUNCIL 238 Comrade, We would propose getting together for a meeting of the Council on Monday, January 25, at 4 p.

, in the Landolt restaurant.
If you appoint a different place and time, please let us know not later than Sunday, for one of us lives far away from Geneva.
As regards secretarial duties, we think it should be pos-sible to restrict ourselves to the services of Comrade Martov, who was already appointed secretary of the Coun-cil at its first meeting.
We would emphatically protest against Comrade Blumen-feld as secretary for, in the first place, he does not observe the rules of secrecy (he informed Druyan of Lenin’s mem-bership of the Central Committee); secondly, he is too expansive, so that there is no guarantee of calm and business-like qualities, and there is even the danger of a row and of having the door locked.
Thirdly, we may have to discuss him personally on the Council, as purchaser of Party literature.
If you consider a special person necessary as secretary, we propose for this Comrade Bychkov, who is one of the old members of the Iskra organisation and a prominent Party activist (a member of the Organising Committee); moreover he is the most impartial and capable of recording everything calmly.

PLEKHANOV, CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY COUNCIL Comrade, We are unfortunately compelled to enter our emphatic protest against the editorial board’s proposal of Comrade Gurvich as secretary.
Firstly, there were a number of conflicts with him in the C.
C.
Secondly, he has expressed in writing (we can send you a copy) such an attitude to the Council, the highest Party institution, that his participation in the Council meeting is quite impossible.
Thirdly—and chiefly—we shall probably have to raise in the Council the question of Comrade Gurvich personally, as a representative of the League’s board of management, who, in our opinion, has shown a wrong attitude to the Central Committee.
It is inconvenient to have as secretary a person whose activities are being questioned.
We draw attention also to the fact that, appreciating the importance of the Council as an instrument for unity and agreement (and not for disunity and discord) we im-mediately proposed as secretary someone who has taken no part in the dissensions and against whom there has been no protest by the other side.
We are sure that the other side, too, the editorial board of the Central Organ, could easily propose a candidate who has not taken part in the dissensions and who could not be the subject of discussion on the Council.

For the C.
C.
(to be handed to N.
N.
*) The meetings (three sittings) of the Party Council ended yesterday.
These meetings brought into sharp focus the whole political situation within the Party.
Plekhanov sided with the Martovites, outvoting us on every question of any importance.
Our resolution condemning boycott, etc.
(boycott by either side), was not put to the vote; a line was merely drawn in principle between impermissible and permissible forms of struggle.
On the other hand, a resolu-tion of Plekhanov’s was adopted saying it was desirable that the C.
C.
co-opt an appropriate (sic!) number from the Minority.
After this we withdrew our resolution and sub-mitted a protest against this policy of place-hunting on the part of the Council.
Three Council members (Martov, Axelrod and Plekhanov) replied that it was “beneath their dignity” to examine this protest.
We stated that the only honest way out was a congress.
The Council rejected it.
The three members passed resolutions legitimising (!) the editorial board’s sending out its representatives separate-ly from the C.
C.
, and instructing the C.
C.
to give the editorial board literature in the amount required for distri-bution (!).
That means giving it them for their own trans-portation and delivery, for they now send out one “agent” after another, who refuse to execute commissions for the Central Committee.
In addition, they also have transport ready (they proposed sharing the cost of carriage fifty-fifty).
Iskra (No.
57) has an article by Plekhanov calling our C.

How many is unknown; according to private information, not less than three out of a very * N.

short list (of 5-6, apparently), perhaps with a demand also for the resignation of someone from the Central Committee.
One must be blind not to see now what is afoot.
The Council will bring pressure to bear on the C.
C.
in every possible way, demanding complete surrender to the Marto-vites.
Either—an immediate congress, the immediate col-lection of resolutions on a congress from 11-12 committees, and the immediate concentration of all efforts on agitating for a congress.
Or—the resignation of the whole C.
C.
, for no C.
C.
member will consent to the ignominious and ludic-rous role of accepting people who foist themselves on the C.
C.
, people who will not rest content until they have taken everything into their hands, and who will drag every trifle before the Council so as to get their own way.
Kurtz and I insistently demand that the C.
C.
be convened immediately at all costs to decide the matter, taking into account, of course, our votes as well.
We repeat em-phatically and for the hundredth time: either a congress at once, or resignation.
We invite our dissentients to come here, so as to judge the situation on the spot.
Let them try in practice to get along with the Martovites and not write us hollow phrases about the value of peace! We have no money.
The C.
O.
is overloading us with expenses, obviously pushing us towards bankruptcy, and obviously counting on a financial crash in order to take extraordinary measures which would reduce the C.
C.
to a cipher.
We need two or three thousand rubles immediately at all costs.
Without fail and immediately, otherwise we shall face complete ruin within a month! We repeat: think it over carefully, send delegates here and take a straightforward view of the matter.
Our last word is: either a congress or the resignation of the whole Central Committee.
Reply at once as to whether you give us your votes.
If not, let us know what is to be done if Kurtz and I resign, let us know without fail.

In my opinion, you must make Deer go away at once and change his skin.
It is stupid and ridiculous of him to await the blow.
The only way out is to go underground and travel about.
It only seems to him that such a step is difficult and hard to take.
Deer should try it and he will quickly find that his new position will become a normal one for him.
(I utterly fail to understand or share Konya-ga’s arguments against it.
) Next, about the whole political situation.
Things are in a terrible tangle.
Plekhanov has gone over to the Martov-ites and is overpowering us in the Council.
The Council has expressed a desire that the C.
C.
should have additional members (this is published in Iskra No.
58).
The Council has given the editorial board the right to send out agents and receive literature for distribution.
The Martovites evidently have their own war fund and are only waiting for a suitable moment for a coup d’état (such a moment as a financial crash—we are without money—or a break-down in Russia, etc.
).
I have no doubt about this and Kurtz and I are demanding that C.
C.
mem-bers who do doubt it should, come here to convince them-selves, for it is ridiculous and undignified to have people pulling different ways.
I believe we should now 1) kick up a row in the commit-tees against the C.
O.
by means of the most militant resolutions; 2) carry on a polemic against the C.
O.
in leaflets of the committees; 3) adopt resolutions on a congress inthe committees and publish them locally; 4) set Schwarz, Vakar and others to work on leaflets for the Central Com-mittee.
Hans should be warned that he will definitely be used to give false evidence against me, that is certain.
If Hans does not want this to happen, let him immediately send a written categorical statement: 1) that there was no agree-ment about non-publication of the negotiations; 2) that in the Council on November 29, 1903, Hans did not promise to co-opt on to the C.
C.
; 3) that Hans understood that the Martovites would take over the C.
C.
for the purpose of peace and that they balked his expectations by launch-ing war, beginning with No.
53.
We shall publish this statement only if they provoke us.

Old Man writing.
I have read the letters of Zemlyachka and Konyagin.
Where he got the idea that I have now realised the uselessness of a congress, God only knows.
On the contrary, I insist as before that this is the only honest way out, that only short-sighted people and cowards can dodge this conclusion.
I insist as before that Boris, Mitrofan and Horse should be sent here without fail, for people need to see the situation (especially that which arose after the Council meetings) for themselves, and not waste their time preaching to the winds from afar, hiding their heads under their wings and taking advantage of the fact that the C.
C.
is a long way off and it would take a year and a day to reach it.
There is nothing more absurd than the opinion that working for a congress, agitating in the committees, and getting them to pass well-thought-out and forceful (and not sloppy) resolutions precludes “positive” work or con-tradicts it.
Such an opinion merely betrays an inability to understand the political situation which has now arisen in the Party.
The Party is virtually torn apart, the Rules have been turned into scraps of paper and the organisation is spat upon—only complaisant Gothamites can still fail to see this.
To anyone who has grasped this, it should be clear that the Martovites’ attack must be met with an equal attack (and not with fatuous vapourings about peace, etc.
).
And for an attack, all forces must be set in motion.
All technical facilities, transport and receiving arrangements should be handled exclusively by auxiliary personnel, assistants and agents.
It is supremely unwise to use C.
C.
members for this.
The C.
C.
members must occupy all the committees, mobilise the Majority, tour Russia, unite their people, launch an onslaught (in reply to the Martov-ites’ attacks), an onslaught on the C.
O.
, an onslaught by means of resolutions 1) demanding a congress; 2) challeng-ing the editors of the C.
O.
to say whether they will submit to the congress on the question of the composition of the editorial board; 3) branding the new Iskra without “phi-listine delicacy”, as was done recently by Astrakhan, Tver and the Urals.
These resolutions should be published in Russia, as we have said a hundred times already.
I believe that we really do have in the C.
C.
bureaucrats and formalists, instead of revolutionaries.
The Martovites spit in their faces and they wipe it off and lecture me: “it is useless to fight!” .
.
.
Only bureaucrats can fail to see now that the C.
C.
is not a C.
C.
and its efforts to be one are ludicrous.
Either the C.
C.
becomes an organisation of war against the C.
O.
, war in deeds and not in words, of war waged in the committees, or the C.
C.
is a useless rag, which deserves to be thrown away.
For heaven’s sake, can’t you see that centralism has been irretrievably shattered by the Martovites! Forget all idiotic formalities, take possession of the committees, teach them to fight for the Party against the circle spirit abroad, write leaflets for them (this will not hinder agitation for a congress, but assist it!), use auxiliary forces for technical jobs.
Take the lead in the war against the C.
O.
or renounce altogether ludicrous pretensions to “leadership” .
.
.
by wip-ing off the spittle.
Claire’s behaviour is shameful, but Konyaga’s encourage-ment of him is still worse.

Comrades, Having received notification of your collective decision of the C.
C.
majority against a congress and the desirability of putting an end to “squabbling”, and having discussed this notification among the three of us (Kurtz, Beast and Lenin), we unanimously adopted the following decision: 1) Kurtz and Lenin will temporarily resign membership of the Council (while remaining members of the C.
C.
) until the true nature of our differences with the major-ity of the Central Committee has been cleared up.
(We stated in the Council that we see no other honest way out of the squabbling except a congress, and we voted for a congress.
) We stress that we are withdrawing temporarily and conditionally, by no means resigning altogether, and greatly desiring a comradely clarification of our differences and misunderstandings.
2) In view of (a) the need for C.
C.
members on the Coun-cil to live abroad; (b) the need for personal consultation with the C.
C.
members in Russia; c) the need for a C.
C.
member abroad after the departure of Kurtz, Beast and Lenin (Kurtz and Beast are leaving for Russia, Lenin is taking his official and full holiday for not less than two months); (d) the need to arrange that the conduct of affairs here that give rise to “squabbling” should be in the hands of those C.
C.
members who disagree with us, for we are powerless to combat the squabbling otherwise than as we are doing, —in view of all this, we most earnestly request the C.
C.
to send here immediately and without fail at least one of its members from Russia.
We ask you to inform us at once of the receipt of this letter and of your reply.
P.
S.
To avoid gossip and false rumours, we have informed the Council of our resignation in the following form (copy in full): “To the Chairman of the Party Council “Comrade, in view of the departure of one of us, and the holiday being taken by the other, we are regretfully compelled to relinquish temporarily the post of C.

239 If Valentin is unwilling to consult on everything and to hand all, absolutely all, information to Stake, then let Valentin resign.
Let Stake bear in mind that the whole course of events is now in our favour; a little more patience and persistence, and we shall win.
Make sure to acquaint everyone with the pamphlet, * es-pecially Brutus.
After the pamphlet we must make a fur-ther attack on Brutus.
Brutus will be ours; for the time being I shall not accept his withdrawal; you should not accept it either; put his resignation in your pocket for the time being.
There is no question of Zemlyachka’s resignation, remember that; Nil does not even claim that she has resigned.
Inform Zemlyachka about this and stand firm.
I repeat: our side will gain the upper hand within the Central Committee.

KRZHIZHANOVSKY Dear friend, You will, of course, grasp the gist of the matter from our agreement with Nil.
240 For heaven’s sake, don’t be in a hurry to make decisions and don’t despair.
Be sure first to read my pamphlet * and the Council minutes.
Do not let your temporary withdrawal from affairs worry you; better abstain from some of the voting, but do not with-draw altogether.
Believe me, you will still be very, very much needed and all your friends are counting on your early “resurrection”.
Many people in the Party are still in a state of bewilderment and confusion, at a loss to grasp the new situation and faint-heartedly losing confidence in themselves and in the right cause.
On the other hand, it is becoming more and more evident to us here that we are gaining from delays, that the squabbling is dying out of itself and the essential issue, that of principles, is irrevocably coming into the forefront.
And in this respect the new Iskra is pitiably feeble.
Don’t believe the stupid tales that we are out for a split, arm yourself with a certain amount of patience and you will soon see that our campaign is a splendid one and that we shall win by the force of conviction.
Be sure you reply to me.
It would be best if you could wangle things so as to come out here for a week or so—not on business, but just for a holiday, and to meet me somewhere in the mountains.
I assure you that you will still be very much needed, and although Konyaga * One Step Forward, Two Steps Back (see present edition, Vol.
7).
— Ed.
mistakenly dissuaded you from one plan of yours—a thing put off is not a thing lost! Gird up your loins, we are still full of fight.

KRASIN 241 From Old Man to Horse, private In connection with the documents sent you (the agree-ment with Nil and my official letter to the C.
C.
* ), I should like to have a talk with you, but I do not know whether we shall succeed in meeting.
Your “friend” 242 was here recently and he spoke of your possible arrival, but Nil contradicted this news.
It will be a great pity if you do not come; your coming would be absolutely essential in all respects, as there are misunderstandings galore and they will increase more and more, hindering all work, unless we succeed in meeting and having a detailed talk.
Write to me without fail whether you are coming and what you think of my pamphlet.
In general, you are un-pardonably inactive where letters are concerned.
In my opinion, Boris (and Konyaga, too, apparently) have got stuck in an obviously obsolete point of view.
They are still “living in November”, when squabbling overrode everything else in our Party struggle, when it was permissible to hope that everything would “come right of itself” given a certain personal tractibility, etc.
This point of view is now antiquated and to persist in it means either being a parrot senselessly repeating one and the same thing, or a political weathercock, or renouncing any leading role whatsoever and becoming a deaf-and-dumb cabman or factotum.
Events have irrevocably shat-tered this old point of view.
Even the Martovites refuse to have anything to do with “co-optation”; the theoretical * “Letter to the Members of the Central Committee” (see present edition, Vol.
7).
—Ed.
drivel that fills the new Iskra has already de facto pushed all squabbling far into the background (so that now only the parrots can call for a cessation of squabbling); by the force of events the issue has boiled down—for heaven’s sake grasp this—it has boiled down to whether the Party is satisfied with the new Iskra.
If we don’t want to be pawns, we absolutely must understand the present situation and work out a plan for a sustained and inexorable struggle on behalf of the Party principle against the circle spirit, on behalf of revolutionary principles of organisation against opportunism.
It is time to get rid of old bugbears which make out that every such struggle is a split, it is time to stop hiding our heads under our wings, evading one’s Party duties by references to the “positive work” .
.
.
of cabmen and factotums; it is time to abandon the opinion, at which even children will soon be laughing, that agita-tion for a congress is Lenin’s intrigue.
I repeat: the C.
C.
members are in very serious danger of becoming extremely backward eccentrics.
Anyone who possesses a particle of political honour and political honesty must stop shifting and shuffling (even Plekhanov has not succeeded in that, leave alone our good Boris!), and must adopt a definite position and stand by his convictions.
All the very best.

V.
LENGNIK We have just received Absolute’s letter about the meet-ing and do not understand it at all.
On whose initiative is the meeting being arranged? Who will attend it? Will Nikitich, Deer and Valentin be there? It is essential to know everything in the greatest possible detail.
For what may happen is this: Deer, Nikitich and Mitrofan may transfer their votes to Nil or Valentin, which will give them a majority, and they may carry out a coup d’état; it is easier to do this abroad, where the Council is at hand to sanction their decisions.
In general a meeting here of the soft mem-bers 243 may turn out to be very dangerous at the present time.
Judging by the way Nil behaves, one could expect anything from him.
He says, for example, in connection with Plekhanov’s letter: “We must reply that we do not agree with Lenin’s policy, but we don’t want to give him up.
” What he understands by Lenin’s policy, God alone knows.
He refused to discuss matters with Falcon: “You will learn my opinion from Valentin.
” He talks to the Minority in a very friendly way, quite different from the way he talks to the Majority.
Falcon wanted to go away today, but just now we are in some perplexity.
The “soft” ones alone may decide, if it is to their advantage, that transfer of votes is not allowed, in which case Falcon ought not go away—it will be an extra vote and, besides, support for Lenin is needed.
If, however, there are no grounds for thinking that the meeting will end in a coup, then there is no need for Falcon to hang about.
In the first event, wire: “Geld folgt” * (meaning: Falcon to travel immedi-* “Money follows”.

ately); in the second event, wire: “Brief folgt” * (meaning-Falcon to remain abroad).
The address for the telegram is.
.
.
.
** Reply also by letter without delay and in as much detail as possible.
Settle the time more exactly.
What do you mean by: prepare lodgings? Do you too think that all the “stone-hards” can go away without everything falling into the hands of the hard-soft “Matryona-ites”? If, for example, Valentin remains while the others go away, he can break a lot of china.
In that case, perhaps, Falcon’s presence will be needed in Russia.
Think all this over very carefully.
At present we do not share your optimism con-cerning the C.
C.
, but we are optimists as regards our victory.
If the meeting is a general one, let Stake once more make desperate efforts to drag Deer out here and explain to him that the transfer of his (Deer’s) vote to Konyaga or Boris could mean a coup d’état and Lenin’s withdrawal for a desperate struggle.

MARTOV, SECRETARY OF THE PARTY COUNCIL Reply to Comrade Martov Comrade, I received your undated letter while travelling, and without having the Council minutes at hand.
At all events I consider it in principle absolutely impermissible and unlawful that outside a Council meeting members of the Council should give their votes or make arrangements on any matters that come within the competence of the Coun-cil.
I cannot therefore comply with your request about voting for candidates.
If I am not mistaken, the Council decided that all Council members should represent our Party at the Congress.
244 Consequently, the question has been settled.
If any Council member is unable to go, then, in my opinion, he can appoint someone else in his place; I do not know, of course, whether it is customary for in-ternational congresses to permit such substitution, but I do not know of any obstacle to it in our Party Rules or in the Party’s usual regulations.
Personally I am also unable to go and would like as a substitute for myself Comrade Lyadov, who has plenipotentiary powers from the C.
C.
, and Comrade Sergei Petrovich, member of the Moscow Committee.
With Social-Democratic greetings, N.

VLADIMIROV 245 For Fred Dear Comrade, I have received your last letter.
I am writing to the old address, although I am afraid that letters are not reach-ing you; the previous letter was answered in considerable detail.
The comradely trust which is evident in all your letters induces me to write to you personally.
This letter is not written from the collegium and is not intended for the Committee.
The state of things in your Committee, which is suffer-ing from a lack of people, lack of literature and complete lack of information, is similar to the state of things in Russia as a whole.
Everywhere there is a terrible lack of people, even more so in the Minority committees than in those of the Majority, complete isolation, a general mood of depression and bitterness, stagnation as regards positive work.
Ever since the Second Congress, the Party is being torn to pieces, and today things have gone very, very far in this respect; the tactics of the Minority have terribly weakened the Party.
The Minority has done all it could to discredit the C.
C.
as well, beginning its per-secution already at the congress, and carrying it on inten-sively both in the press and orally.
In even greater measure it has discredited the C.
O.
, which it has turned from a Party organ into an organ for settling personal accounts with the Majority.
If you have been reading Iskra there is no need to say anything to you about this.
In their attempts to dig up fresh disagreements they have now trotted forth as their slogan “liquidation of the fourth, Iskra,period”, and are burning everything that they worshipped yesterday, totally distorting the perspective and interpret it.
The Party functionaries, who remember what they stood for yesterday, do not follow the lead of the C.
O.
The vast majority of the committees adhere to the standpoint of the Congress majority and are breaking their spiritual ties with the Party organ more and more.
The present state of affairs, however, is having such an effect on positive work, and hindering it to such an extent, that among a whole number of Party functionaries a mood has developed that makes them immerse themselves in positive work and stand completely aloof from the em-bittered internecine struggle which is taking place in the Party.
They want to close their eyes, stop up their ears and hide their heads under the wing of positive work; they are running away to escape from things which no one, being in the Party, can now escape from.
Some of the C.
C.
members have adopted such a “ conciliatory ” attitude in an attempt to blanket the growing disagreements, to blan-ket the fact that the Party is disintegrating.
The Majority (the non-conciliatory Majority) says: we must quickly find some way out, we must come to some arrangement, we must try to find the framework within which the ideological struggle can proceed more or less normally; a new congress is needed.
The Minority is against a congress; they say: the vast majority of the Party is against us and a congress is not to our advantage; the “conciliatory” Majority is also against a congress, it is afraid of everyone’s growing animosity against the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
To think that a congress could lead only to a split would mean to admit that we haven’t got a Party at all, that Party feeling is so poorly developed among all of us that it cannot over-come the old circle spirit.
In this respect we have a better opinion of our opponents than they have of themselves.
Of course, it is impossible to guarantee anything, but an attempt to settle the conflict in a Party manner, and to find a way out, must be made.
The Majority, at any rate, does not want a split, but to go on working under the con-ditions which have now been created is becoming more and more impossible.
Already more than ten committees have expressed themselves in favour of a congress (St.
Petersburg, Tver, Moscow, Tula, Siberia, Caucasus, Ekate-rinoslav, Nikolayev, Odessa, Riga, Astrakhan), but even if the great majority of the committees pronounce for a congress it will not take place so very soon, for both the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
, and probably the Council as well, will oppose the wishes of the majority of the comrades in Russia.
With regard to literature, the C.
C.
comrade with whom we talked about this replied that it was being punctually supplied to your Committee.
Obviously, there has been some confusion.
Persons were sent to you twice, but in Russia they were directed to other places.
We shall try to send you new things as opportunity arises.

Not even I, a member of the C.

In reply to your note of August 30, 1904, we inform you that the lawfulness and validity of the C.

In the capacity of C.
C.
agents who have been kept informed of the whole course of the conflict within the C.

cannot be recognised as lawful, for it begins by stating as a fact what is known to be untrue: here abroad we ourselves have seen two C.

members who were not informed of the meeting of the Central Committee.
Since you have once told us a direct untruth (about an alleged ban imposed by the Central Committee on Comrade Lenin’s book * ) we are the more inclined to doubt statements ema-nating from you.
We therefore request you to furnish us immediately with exact data for checking the lawfulness of the C.

decision (composition of the meeting ** and written statements of each participant).
While having no intention whatever to oppose lawful decisions of an actual majority of the C.

MARTOV, SECRETARY OF THE PARTY COUNCIL To Comrade Martov September 2, 1904 Comrade, In reply to your invitation of August 31, 1904, to a sitting of the Council, I must state that until the lawfulness of the composition of the C.
C.
and of its last, allegedly regular, meeting has been verified by all C.
C.
members, I do not consider either Comrade Glebov or myself entitled to represent the C.
C.
in the Party Council.
Until such a check is made I regard all official steps undertaken by Comrade Glebov (and participation in the Council is also an official step) as unlawful.
I shall confine myself to pointing out one obvious un-truth and one inaccuracy in the “verification” of the C.
C.
’s composition carried out by three C.
C.
members at their “meeting” of .
.
.
July.
1) Regarding the resignation of Mitrofanov, I have the written statement of Comrade Osipov.
About the resignation of Travinsky, I have had no definite written statement from anyone.
Three C.
C.
members at least prematurely accepted the resignation, without consulting the other members.
2) Regarding the notorious resignation of Comrade Osipov I have a written communication of C.
C.
member Vasiliev about his dispute with Comrade Valentin and the decision to examine the dispute at a general meeting of the Central Committee.
About Osipov’s resignation, too, I have not had a single communication.
The statement of the three C.
C.
members that Osipov formally announced his withdrawal at the preceding regular meeting of the C.
C.
is an obvious lie,documentarily refuted by the agreement of May 26, 1904, signed by Zverev and Glebov.
This agreement, which was concluded months after the “preceding regular meeting of the C.
C.
” and after Osipov is alleged to have joined the St.
Petersburg Committee, records the C.
C.
as consisting of nine members, i.
e.
, including Osipov.

O.
MARTOV, SECRETARY OF THE PARTY COUNCIL To Comrade Martov Duplicate September 7, 1904 Comrade, In connection with the copies you have sent me, I have to state that the Council need not have troubled to repeat its invitation, seeing that I have already replied to it by a refusal.
Never have I expressed a desire that investiga-tion of the “conflict” in the C.
C.
should be submitted to the Council.
On the contrary, I have plainly stated in letters to Comrade Glebov and to Comrade Martov that only the C.
C.
members as a whole are competent to verify the lawfulness of its composition.
The Council is not author-ised even by the Rules to examine conflicts within the Central Committee.
* Since the Bureau of the International Congress has accept-ed the transference by me of my mandate, 248 I am no longer accountable in any way to any Council.
I shall willingly give explanations (in writing or in print) con-cerning definite issues to anyone who wants them.

Comrades, In reply to your resolution on the desirability of an Organ-ising Committee of the Majority being set up, we hasten to inform you that we entirely agree with your idea.
We should prefer only to call the group not an Organising Committee, but a Bureau of the Majority Committees.
We do not consider it possible for us to appoint the B.
M.
C.
ourselves, and are restricting ourselves to recommending comrades Martyn, Demon and K.
, Baron, Sergei Petrovich, Felix and Lebedev, who (as you know) have actually begun the work of uniting the Majority committees.
We think that, given the direct support of several committees, these comrades could act as a special group uniting the activities of supporters of the Majority.

Have you received the supplement to Nos.

If you have not received these decisions, enquire about them also from the C.

We shall issue shortly a detailed examination of these Council decisions.

Let Odessa send immediately Nikolayev’s decision concerning the congress.
Written later than October 5 , 1904 Sent from Geneva to Russia First published in 1 9 3 0 Printed from the original114 TO THE SIBERIAN COMMITTEE Geneva, October 30, 1904 To the Siberian Committee from N.
Lenin Comrades, I should like through you to answer Comrade Simonov, who was here as a representative of the Siberian Union and who, before departing, left me a letter (I was not in Ge-neva at the time) setting out his conciliatory point of view.
It is this letter, the contents of which are probably known to you from Comrade Simonov, that I should like to talk to you about.
Comrade Simonov’s point of view amounts to this: they (the Minority) are, of course, anarchists and disrupters, but there is nothing to be done with them; a “truce” is necessary (Simonov stresses that, in contrast to other conciliators, he does not speak of peace but of a truce) in order to find some way out of an intolerable situa-tion, and to gather strength for a further struggle against the Minority.
I found Simonov’s letter extremely instructive as coming from such a rarity as a sincere supporter of conciliation.
There is so much hypocrisy among the conciliators that one finds it refreshing to meet the views (even if incorrect) of a man who says what he thinks.
And his views are cer-tainly incorrect.
He himself realises that it is impossible to be reconciled with falsehood, confusion and squabbling, but what is the sense of talking about a truce? For the Mi-nority will use such a truce merely for strengthening their positions.
Factional polemics (cessation of which was hypo-critically promised by the hypocritical C.
C.
in its recent letter to the committees, a letter that you too have prob-ably already received) have not ceased but have assumed the especially vile forms that were condemned even by Kautsky, who sides with the Minority.
Even K.
Kautsky said in his letter to Iskra that a “hidden” polemic is worse than any other, for the issue becomes confused, hints re-main obscure, straightforward answers are impossible.
And take Iskra; the leading article in No.
75, the subject of which is very remote from our differences, will be found interspersed, without rhyme or reason, with senilely em-bittered abuse against the Ivanovs on the Council, the sheer ignoramuses, etc.
, etc.
From the standpoint of our deserters from the C.
C.
, this, probably, is not factional polemics! I say nothing, in substance, of the arguments used by the author of the leading article (apparently Plekhanov): that Marx was mild towards the Proudhonists.
Can you imagine a falser use of historical facts and great names of history? What would Marx have said if the slogan of mildness was used to cover up muddling the distinction between Marxism and Proudhonism? (And is not the new Iskra wholly occu-pied in muddling the distinction between Rabocheye Dyelo-ism and Iskrism?) What would Marx have said if mildness had been made a cover for asserting in print the correctness of Proudhonism against Marxism? (And is not Plekhanov now playing the fox in print by pretending to recognise that the Minority is correct in principle?) By this com-parison alone Plekhanov gives himself away, betrays the fact that the relation of the Majority to the Minority is equivalent to the relation of Marxism to Proudhonism, to that very relation of the revolutionary to the opportunist wing which figures also in that memorable article “What Should Not Be Done”.
Take the decisions of the Party Council (No.
73 and the supplement to Nos.
73-74) and you will see that the cessation of the Minority’s secret organisa-tion, proclaimed in the above-mentioned letter of the C.
C.
to the committees, signifies nothing but the passing of three C.
C.
members into the secret organisation of the Minority.
In this sense the secret organisation has really disappeared, for all three of our so-called central institutions—not only the C.
O.
and the Council, but also the Central Com-mittee—have now become a secret organisation (for struggle against the Party).
In the name of a struggle (“on prin-ciple”) against formalism and bureaucracy, they are now declaring war on the “headings”, declaring that the pub-lishing house of the Majority is not a Party one.
They fal-sify the congress, counting the votes falsely (16 9 4 = 61, for five members of the Council figure in the total 61, but in half the organisations the Council figures as an organisa-tion with two votes!), concealing the resolutions of the committees from the Party (it is concealed that Nizhni-Novgorod, Saratov, Nikolayev and the Caucasus were in favour of a congress: see the last resolutions in our pamphlet To the Party, and The Fight for a Congress 253 ).
They bring squabbling into the Council, interminably distorting the question of representation at the Amsterdam Congress 254 and having the audacity to publish charges of “deceit” against the Northern Committee, when this incident had not only not been investigated (although the C.
C.
had decided to investigate it as far back as July), but the com-rade accused by some slanderer has so far not even been questioned (during three months, August, September and October, this comrade was abroad and saw Central Com-mittee member Glebov, who had taken the decision for an investigation but did not take the trouble to present the charges to the accused person himself!).
They encourage disruption in the name of the Council, inciting the “periph-ery” to attack the Majority committees, and uttering a deliberate lie about St.
Petersburg and Odessa.
They condemn as an “abuse” the voting of one and the same com-rades in different committees, when at the same time three Council members—Plekhanov, Martov and Axelrod—vote three times against a congress: once on the editorial board, once in the Council and once in the League! They assume the powers of a congress by declaring credentials invalid.
Isn’t that falsifying the congress? And can it be that Com-rade Simonov would advise a truce in relation to these tactics as well? Take the report to the Amsterdam Congress 255 which has recently been issued in Russian.
Deliberately flouting the will of the Party, the Minority speak in the name of the Party, repeating in a covert form the same lie about the old Iskra which was always being propagated by Martynov and Co.
, and which is now being served up by Balalaikin-Trotsky.
Or maybe Comrade Simonov wants a truce with this Balalaikin too (whose pamphlet is published under the editorship of Iskra as plainly stated in Iskra)? Maybe here, too, he believes in the cessation of factional polemics prom-ised by the C.
C.
? No, the belief that a truce with hypocrisy and disrup-tion is permissible is one that is unworthy of a Social-Democrat and profoundly erroneous at bottom.
It is faint-heartedness to think that “there is nothing to be done” with writers, even notable ones, and that the only tactic left in relation to them is that formulated by Galyorka (“Down with Bonapartism”) in the words “You curse but bow down”.
To the conversion of all the Party’s central institutions into a secret organisation for struggle against the Party, to the Council’s falsification of the congress, the Majority replies by a further and inevitable strengthen-ing of its unity.
Disdaining hypocrisy, it openly puts for-ward a programme of struggle (see the resolution of the 22 endorsed by the Caucasian Union, 256 and the Commit-tees of St.
Petersburg, Riga, Moscow, Odessa, Ekaterinoslav and Nikolayev.
The C.
O.
, of course, concealed this reso-lution from the Party although it received it two months ago).
The southern committees have already taken a de-cision to unite the committees of the Majority and to set up an Organising Committee to combat the flouting of the Party.
There is not the slightest doubt that such an organ-isation of the Majority will be set up in the near future and will act openly.
Despite the lying stories of deserters from the C.
C.
, the adherents of the Majority are growing in number in Russia, and the young literary forces, repelled by the muddled and hypocritical Iskra, are beginning to rally from all sides to the newly-started publishing house of the Majority (the publishing house abroad of Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin) with the aim of giving it every pos-sible support by transforming, enlarging and developing it.
Comrade Simonov had no reason to be down-hearted.
He was wrong to jump to the conclusion that however nasty it was, there was nothing to be done about it.
There is something to be done! The more grossly they flout the idea of a congress (Balalaikin-Trotsky, writing under the editorship of Iskra, has already declared a congress to bea reactionary attempt to reinforce the plans of the Iskrists.
Ryazanov was more sincere and honest when he called the congress a packed affair) and the more grossly they flout the Party and its functionaries in Russia, the more merciless becomes the rebuff they encounter and the more closely does the Majority rally its ranks, uniting all per-sons of principle and recoiling from the unnatural and intrinsically rotten political alliance of Plekhanov, Marty-nov and Trotsky.
It is precisely such an alliance that we see now in the new Iskra and in Zarya No.
5 (a reprint of Martynov’s article has appeared).
Anyone who sees a little further than his nose, whose policy is not determined by interests of the minute and coalitions of the hour, will understand that this alliance, which breeds only confusion and squabbles, is doomed, and that the adherents of the trend of the old Iskra, people who are able to distinguish this trend from a circle even of notable “foreigners”, must and will be the grave-diggers of this alliance.
I should be very glad, comrades, if you would inform me of the receipt of this letter and whether you have succeeded in forwarding it to Comrade Simonov.
With comradely greetings, N.

STOPANI 257 To Tu—ra from Lenin, private Dear Comrade, I was extremely glad to have your letter.
Please write punctually every week, even if only a few lines, and make sure that all addresses are usable and that you have reserve addresses for letters and rendezvous.
It’s a downright scan-dal that the adherents of the Majority are so scattered! No common work is possible without regular contact and we have had nothing from you for over six months.
I absolutely and fully agree with everything you write concerning the need to unite the Majority, to rally its com-mittees and prepare for a united congress capable of en-forcing the will of the Party workers in Russia.
Very close contact is essential for all this, otherwise we shall drift apart and you will know absolutely nothing of our com-mon affairs.
The C.
C.
has now wholly fused with the Minority and has virtually become part of its secret organisation, the aim of which is to fight against a congress at all costs.
The new decisions of the Council plainly falsify both the counting of votes and the will of the committees (supplement to Iskra Nos.
73-74.
Have you seen it?).
Now we must be prepared for the fact that they will not convene a congress on any account, will not shrink from any violation of the Rules, nor from any further flouting of the Party.
They openly jeer at us, saying “where is your strength?” We should indeed be behaving like children if we confined ourselves to faith in a congress, without preparing straight-away to counter force by force.
For this purpose we must: 1) immediately unite all the Majority committees and set up a Bureau of the Majority Committees (the initiative has already been taken by Odessa & Nikolayev & Ekateri-noslav) to combat the Bonapartism of the central bodies;2) exert every effort to support and extend in every way the Majority’s publishing house (started here by Bonch-Bruyevich and myself; Bonch-Bruyevich is only the pub-lisher).
A group of writers in Russia has already set to work on this and you should immediately begin collecting and sending all kinds of material, correspondence, leaflets, comments, and so on and so forth, especially from workers and about the workers’ movement.
Do this without fail and immediately.
(If from now on you do not begin to send us an item every week, we shall break off relations with you.
) In the matter of the Bureau, what has been done already is this.
The Odessa & Nikolayev & Ekaterinoslav committees took the following decision (quote in full) .
.
.
= = The 22 answered them as follows .
.
.
= =258 You must try to go to Tiflis as soon as possible and hand over both the one and the other.
Let them speedily join.
It will, of course, be possible to add members from the Caucasus to the Bureau.
And so, let all the committees of the Caucasus immediately give their opinion about the idea of a Bureau, that is to say, write to us and to St.
Pe-tersburg (or Riga?) (address.
.
.
, key .
.
.
), whether they agree to a Bureau and whether they want changes or additional candidates.
For heaven’s sake see to it that this matter of prime importance is dealt with properly, sensibly and quickly.
Some comrades are demanding a conference of the Major-ity committees in Russia.
We here think this is not only expensive but bureaucratic and ineffectual.
But we must press on with might and main.
It is not worth while coming together to elect a Bureau; it is much better to reach agreement on this by letter or by a tour made by one or two comrades When the Bureau speaks out and is joined by Ekaterinoslav & Odessa & Nikolayev & St.
Petersburg & Mos-cow & Riga & the Caucasus, then this Bureau will at once be speaking as the representative of the organised Majority.
And so, for heaven’s sake, make haste and answer speedily.
All the very best.

BOGDANOV Dear friend, Please tell Rakhmetov immediately that he is acting like a real pig towards us.
He cannot imagine how eagerly everyone here is expecting from him definite and precise, encouraging reports, and not the telegrams he sends us.
This eternal suspense and uncertainty is real torture.
It is absolutely impossible that Rakhmetov should have noth-ing to write about: he has seen and is seeing many people, he has spoken with Zemlyachka, he has been in touch with Beard, the Moscow lawyers and writers, etc.
, etc.
He must keep us au courant, pass on contacts, inform us of new ad-dresses, forward local correspondence, tell us about busi-ness meetings and interesting encounters.
Rakhmetov has not sent us a single new contact! It’s monstrous.
Not a single item of correspondence, not a single report about the group of writers in Moscow.
If Rakhmetov were to be arrested tomorrow, we’d find ourselves empty-handed, as if he had never lived! It’s a crying shame; he could have written everything and about everything without the slight-est danger, and all he has done is to hint at some young forces and so on.
(What is known about Bazarov, Frich, Suvorov and the others?) Not less than once a week (that’s not much, surely), two or three hours should be spent on a letter of 10-15 pages, otherwise, I give you my word, all contact is virtually broken.
Rakhmetov and his bound-less plans become a boundless fiction, and our people here are simply running away, drawing the horrified conclu-sion that there is no sort of majority and that nothing will come of the majority.
In their new form, the tactics of the Minority have become quite clear, namely, to ignore and keep silent about the Majority’s writings and the Major-ity’s existence, to keep polemics out of the C.
O.
and talk importantly about positive work (recently the editors of the C.
O.
issued in print, “for Party members only”, aletter to Party organisations concerning a plan for the participation of Social-Democrats in the Zemstvo cam-paign—staggering pomposity about staggering banalities.
An analysis and scathing criticism of this letter has been issued here by Lenin * ).
It is essential that the Majority should come forward with an organ of its own 259; the neces-sary money and workers’ letters for this are lacking.
We must work hard to get both the one and the other; unless we have the most detailed and exhaustive letters nothing will come of it.
Contacts are not being transmitted, there is no possibility of attacking one and the same personage from different angles, there is no co-ordination in the work of the bulk of the Bolsheviks who travel about Russia ar-ranging things each on his own.
This dispersal of efforts is felt everywhere; the committees are again lagging behind the situation, some of them unaware of the Council’s new decisions (the supplement to Iskra Nos.
73-74, a special ten-page leaflet), others not giving serious thought to them and not realising that these decisions are tantamount to the most complete and brazen falsification of the congress.
Only children could fail to see now that the Council and C.
C.
will stop at nothing to sabotage a congress.
We must counterpose this by a force = a press organ & t he organisa-tion of the Majority in Russia, otherwise we are bound to die.
Lenin has not yet seen Lightmind; it is strange that the latter has moved to the side lines and maintains a wait-ing attitude! And so, give Rakhmetov a triple dressing-down and make him write a diary as a punishment.
Why hasn’t Mme Rakh-metova gone where she promised? We repeat: all and sun-dry will run away (even Galyorka is groaning and moan-ing), for there is no sign of any contact with Russia, no sign that Rakhmetov is alive, working for the common cause, that he is worried and concerned about it.

117 TO NADEZHDA KRUPSKAYA December 3, 1904 Today I sent a business letter to Bonch.
I forgot to add an important thing—that 3,000 copies (of Leiteisen’s dic-tionary) be printed; this is essential for price calculation.
Tell Bonch about this at once.
I am sending you the statement of the Union Committee and of the Caucasian representative of the C.

* In my opinion, it is absolutely necessary to re-issue this immediately in leaflet form in our publish-ing house.
Do this at once without fail; the Nikolayev and other resolutions can be added to the leaflet, but it should be kept quite small, 2-4 (maximum) pages (without any headings, merely with a mention below of the publish-ers).
I have just received your letter.
I don’t understand what the matter is with the “plan” of Lyadov and Rakhmetov, but there is something wrong here.
I shall try to come as quickly as possible and hasten Destroyer’s arrival.
I warmed the attached sheets but without success.
Per-haps you’ll try some other reagents.
A free evening has occurred unexpectedly.
I am sending you on the other side a letter which I advise you to forward immediately to all three from me personally, ** without a powwow.
It will give them a good shake up; afterwards we could find out whether the news was exaggerated or not.
The fact remains that disunity is beginning, and a warning * Unidentified.

must be issued and the culprits denounced most forcefully at the very start.
I strongly advise you to send this letter off at once to all three from me personally.
Tomorrow I shall talk to Destroyer and, I’m sure, he’ll be for me, so will Vasily Vasilyevich and Schwarz, but it will be best if the text is mine personally.
I wanted to write to Martyn Nikolayevich and give him a piece of my mind, but I don’t think it’s any good; I shall come and talk it over, as he is harmless here for the time being.
As to the damage that has started in Russia, my letter will go some way in paralysing it.
A pity you did not make Martyn Nikolayevich write to me at once in Paris about everything—a great pity, it was so important.
I have re-read the letter to Rakhmetov; a hard word here and there could, perhaps, have been omitted, but I earnestly advise you to send the letter off at once from me personally in this sharply worded form.
I called on Leiteisen.
He read me Plekhanov’s letter to him.
Plekhanov, of course, swears at Lenin for all he is worth.
He writes that “Trotsky’s pamphlet is trashy, like himself”.
He asks Leiteisen “not to side with the Mi-nority, but with him” (Plekhanov).
He complains of “the tragedy of his life, when, after twenty years, there isn’t a comrade who believes him”.
He says that he asks for “comradely confidence but not subordination to authority”, and that he is “seriously thinking of resigning” .
.
.
for the time being this is entre nous.
Deutsch wrote to Leiteisen the other day, asking for financial assistance—he says they have no money.
Zasulich wrote the same thing (earlier) to Yefron, swearing at Ga-lyorka and considering Sergei Petrovich to be Galyorka(!).
I hope to leave on Monday, the day after tomorrow, to read on Tuesday and Wednesday in Zurich, to be in Berne on Thursday, and home on Friday.
It may take a few days longer though.
261 Write to me in Zurich through Argunin (in two envelopes, but see that the inner one is fairly strong, and be cautious).
Have they written from Lausanne, have they asked me to go there? Have they given an address? Yours, N.
LeninBe sure to write immediately to all our committees to send us a formal order to reprint openly for everyone the editorial board’s letter on the Zemstvo.
Do this, just to be on the safe side.
No excuses, please.
Get hold of the letter itself (or republish it) and circulate it in envelopes to the Majority committees.

BOGDANOV, ROZALIA ZEMLYACHKA AND M.
M.
LITVINOV 262 From Lenin to Rakhmetov, Zemlyachka and Papasha, private December 3, 1904 Dear friend, I received news of Martyn Nikolayevich’s arrival (I have not seen him myself) from which I infer that things are in a bad way with us.
The Bolsheviks in Russia and those abroad are at sixes and sevens again.
From three years’ experience I know that such disunity can do enor-mous damage to our cause.
I see evidence of this disunity in the fact: 1) that Rakhmetov’s arrival is being held up; 2) that the weight of emphasis is being shifted from the press organ here to something else, to a congress, a Rus-sian O.
C.
, etc.
; 3) that deals of some kind between the C.
C.
and the writers’ group of the Majority, and almost idiotic enterprises of the Russian organ, are being connived at or even supported.
If my information about this disunity is correct, I must say that the bitterest enemy of the Major-ity could not have invented anything worse.
Holding up Rakhmetov’s departure is sheer unpardonable stupidity, verging on treachery, for gossip is increasing terribly and we risk losing impact here because of the childishly fool-ish plans for devising something immediately in Russia.
To delay the Majority’s organ abroad (for which only the money is lacking) is still more unpardonable.
The whole crux now lies in this organ, without it we shall be heading for certain, inglorious death.
We must get some money at all costs, come what may, if only a couple of thousand, and start immediately, otherwise we are cutting our ownthroats.
Only hopeless fools can put all hopes on a congress, for it is clear that the Council will torpedo any congress, wreck it even before it is convened.
Understand me prop-erly, for heaven’s sake; I am not suggesting that we aban-don all agitation for a congress and renounce this slogan, but only children could now confine themselves to this, and fail to see that the essence lies in strength.
Let there be a spate of resolutions about the congress as before (for some reason Martyn Nikolayevich’s tour did not yield a single repeat resolution, which is a pity, a great pity), but this is not the crux of the matter—how can anyone fail to see this? An Organising Committee or a Bureau of the Major-ity is necessary, but without a press organ this will be a pitiful cipher, a sheer farce, a soap bubble which will burst at the first setback caused by police raids.
At all costs an organ and money, money to us here, get it by any means short of murder.
An Organising Committee or a Bureau of the Majority should authorise us to start an organ (as quickly as possible) and make a round of the committees, but should the O.
C.
take it into its head to first get “pos-itive work” going, and put off the organ for the time being, then such an idiotic Organising Committee would ruin the whole thing for us.
Finally, to publish anything in Russia, to make any sort of deal with the dirty scum of the C.
C.
means committing an outright betrayal.
That the C.
C.
wants to divide and split up the Bolsheviks in Russia and those abroad is obvious; this has long been its plan and none but foolish greenhorns could be taken in by it.
To start an organ in Russia with the help of the C.
C.
is madness, sheer madness or treachery; this is what fol-lows and will inevitably follow from the objective logic of events, because the organisers of an organ or a popular newspaper are bound to be fooled by every mangy tyke of a Central Committee.
I plainly prophesy this and I give such people up in advance as a hopeless case.
I repeat: first and foremost comes an organ, and again an organ, and money for an organ; to spend money on any-thing else now is the height of folly.
Rakhmetov must be dragged out here at once, without delay.
Making a round of the committees should have the primary aim of securing local correspondence (it is inexcusable and disgraceful thatwe have no correspondent items all this time! It’s a down-right shame and a spoke in our wheel!); all agitation for a congress should be merely an incidental matter.
All the Majority committees should immediately and in actual practice break with the C.
C.
and transfer all relations to the O.
C.
or the Bureau of the Majority; this O.
C.
must immediately issue a printed announcement of its formation, and make it public at once without fail.
Unless we nip this disunity among the Majority in the bud, unless we come to an agreement on this both by letter and (most important) by a meeting with Rakhmetov, we here will all give the whole thing up as a hopeless job.
If you want to work together, you must all pull together and act in concert, by agreement (and not in defiance of and without agreement).
Damn it all, it’s a downright dis-grace and scandal that people go out to get money for an organ and engage instead in all kinds of piddling lousy affairs.
In a few days I shall come out in print against the C.
C.
still more vigorously.
If we don’t break with the C.

LITVINOV To Papasha from Lenin Dear friend, I hasten to reply to your letter, which pleased me very, very much.
You are a thousand times right that we must act vigorously, in a revolutionary way, and strike the iron while it’s hot.
I agree, too, that it is the Majority commit-tees that must be united.
The need for a centre in Russia and an organ here is now clear to all of us.
As far as the latter is concerned, we have already done all we could.
Private is working with might and main, he has enlisted participants, has thrown himself whole-heartedly into the job and is trying his hardest to find a millionaire, with considerable chance of success.
Finally, you are a thousand times right in that we must act openly.
The question at issue between us touches only on a minor point and should be discussed calmly, viz.
: whether to have a conference of committees or direct formation of a Bureau of the Majority Committees (we prefer this title to Organising Committee, although of course it is not a matter of the title) which would be recognised at first by some, and afterwards by all, of the Majority committees.
You are for the former, we are for the latter.
If a conference abroad were possible, I would be wholly in favour of it.
In Russia, however, it would be dev-ilishly dangerous, bureaucratic and ineffectual.
Meanwhile Odessa & N ikolayev & E katerinoslav have already come to terms and authorised the “22” to “appoint an Organising Committee”.
We replied by recommending the title “Bureau of the Majority Committees” and seven candidates (Mer-maid, Felix, Zemlyachka, Pavlovich, Gusev, Alexeyev, Baron).
We are writing to Odessa and St.
Petersburg aboutthis.
Alexeyev is already on his way to you.
Will it not be best to carry out the election of candidates through Riga, St.
Petersburg & Moscow, and immediately afterwards make a public statement about this (we are sending you a draft of the announcement * ), and then rush off to the Northern Committee, the Caucasus, Saratov, Nizhni-Novgorod, etc.
, asking them to subscribe and supplementing the Bureau as liberally as possible by a couple or so of their candidates (although it is not very likely that the subscribing commit-tees will demand large additions to the members of the Bureau).
I definitely cannot imagine our meeting with dif-ficulties over the composition of the Bureau.
The advantages of this method are: speed, cheapness, safety.
These advantages are very important, for speed counts above all now.
The Bureau will be the official body for uniting the committees and will in fact completely re-place the C.
C.
in the event of a split.
The membership of the literary group for our future central organ is already fully designated (a five-or six-man board: Private, Gal-yorka, myself, Schwarz & Lunacharsky & perhaps Bazarov).
Tackle the transportation job yourself and do so energetical-ly.
We have got hold here of a former Bundist who has done a lot of work on two frontiers; he promises to arrange things for 200-300 rubles monthly.
We are only waiting for the money before putting him in touch with you.
The disadvantage of your method is the red tape.
I con-sider it quite useless to present ultimatums to the C.
C.
and Council.
The C.
C.
is playing the hypocrite and I don’t doubt now for a moment that they have sold themselves completely to the Minority and are out to falsify the con-gress.
We should not harbour any illusions.
Now, when they control all the central bodies, they have a thousand means for falsifying the congress and have already begun to do so.
We shall prove this in print by analysing the Council’s decisions (Iskra Nos.
73-74, supplement).
We, of course, stand and will continue to stand for a congress, but we must cry from the house-tops that they are already falsify-ing the congress and that we shall expose their falsification.
As a matter of fact, I now put the congress in the ninth * See present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
503-05.
—Ed.
place, allotting the first to the organ and the Russian centre.
It’s absurd to speak of disloyalty when they have pushed us into it themselves by making a deal with the Minority.
It is a lie to say that the secret organisation of the Minority has been dissolved; it has not; three members of the C.
C.
have entered this secret organisation, that is all.
All three central bodies now constitute a secret organisation against the Party.
Only simpletons can fail to see that.
We must reply by an open organisation and expose their conspiracy.
Please strengthen everyone’s faith in our organisation and in the future organ.
We need only to be patient a little longer, while Private finishes his job.
Collect and send us local correspondence (always inscribed: for Lenin) and material, especially from workers.
You and I differ on a minor point, as I would be only too glad to have a confer-ence.
But really, the game is not worth the candle; it will be much better to come out at once with an announcement from the Bureau, for we shall easily reach agreement on its membership and conflicts on this score are improbable.
And once the Bureau proclaims itself it will quickly gain recognition and will begin to speak on behalf of all the committees.
Think this over carefully once more and reply speedily.
Written December 8, 1 9 0 4 Sent from Geneva to Russia First published in 1 9 2 6 Printed from the original120 TO ROZALIA ZEMLYACHKA To Zemlyachka from Old Man December 10, 1904 I have just returned from my lecture tour and received your letter No.
1.
I spoke with Mermaid.
Did you get my abusive letter (sent also to Papasha and Sysoika)? * As regards the composition of the O.
C.
, I, of course, accept the general decision.
I don’t think Private should be drawn into this—he should be sent out here immediately.
Fur-ther, it is essential to organise a special group (or to sup-plement the O.
C.
) for making regular rounds of the commit-tees and maintaining all contacts between them.
Our con-tacts with the committees and with Russia in general are extremely inadequate and we must exert every effort to get more local correspondents’ reports and ordinary letters from comrades.
Why don’t you put us in touch with the Northern Committee? With the Moscow printing workers (this is very important!)? With Ryakhovsky? With Tula? With Nizhni-Novgorod? Do this immediately.
Further, why don’t the committees send us their repeat resolutions con-cerning the congress? This is essential.
I am very much afraid that you are too optimistic about the congress and about the C.
C.
; you will see from the pamphlet The Council Versus the Party (it is already out) that they go to any lengths, perform the devil knows what tricks, in their de-sire to sabotage the congress.
In my opinion, it is a definite mistake on the part of the O.
C.
not to issue a printed an-nouncement.
In the first place, an announcement is necessary in order to offset our open way of acting to the Minority’s * See pp.
271-73 of this volume.
—Ed.
secret organisation.
Otherwise the C.
C.
is bound to catch you out, to take advantage of Sysoika’s ultimatums and talk of your “secret” organisation; this will be a disgrace for the Majority, a disgrace for which you will be wholly to blame.
Secondly, a printed announcement is necessary in order to inform the mass of Party workers about the new centre.
You will never be able to do this even approximately by any letters.
Thirdly, a statement about the unity of the Majority committees will be of tremendous moral signifi-cance as a means of reassuring and encouraging despondent members of the Majority (especially here abroad).
To ne-glect this would be a great political mistake.
I therefore insist, again and again, that immediately after the Northern Conference the Bureau of the Majority (or the O.
C.
of the Majority committees) should issue a printed statement mentioning the consent and direct authorisation of the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, four Caucasian, Riga, St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, and Northern committees, etc.
(perhaps the Tula and Nizhni-Novgorod committees), i.
e.
, 12-14 committees.
This will not only not harm the struggle for a congress but will be of tremendous assistance to it.
Answer at once whether you agree or not.
Regarding the Zemstvo campaign, I strongly recommend that both my pamphlet * and the letter of the Iskra editorial board should be published in Russia immediately and openly (without the stupid heading “for Party members”).
I may write another pamphlet, but the polemic with Iskra must be republished without fail.
Finally, and this is particu-larly important and urgent: may I sign the local manifesto about a new organ ** on behalf of the Organising Commit-tee of the Majority committees (or better the Bureau of the Majority Committees)? May I speak here in the name of the Bureau? May I call the Bureau the publisher of the new organ and organiser of the editorial group? This is extremely necessary and urgent.
Reply immediately, after seeing Private; tell him, and repeat it, that he must come here * The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra”’s Plan (see present edition, Vol.
7).
—Ed.
** “A Letter to the Comrades (With Reference to the Forthcoming Publication of the Organ of the Party Majority)” (see present edition, Vol.

—Ed.
immediately, without delay, if he doesn’t want to run the risk of being arrested and doing great harm to our cause.
People everywhere abroad chatter an awful lot; I have heard them myself when on a lecture tour in Paris, Zurich, etc.
A last warning: either he clears out and comes here at once or ruins himself and throws all our work back a year.
I do not undertake to present any ultimatums about a congress to anyone here, as that would only evoke ridicule and jeers; there is no point in play-acting.
Our position will be ten times cleaner and better if we come forward openly with the Bureau of the Majority and openly declare for a congress, instead of carrying on silly backdoor negotiations, which at best will serve only to delay matters and allow new in-trigues on the part of people like Glebov, Konyagin, Nikit-ich and other rotters.
The entire Majority here is fretting and worrying, longing for an organ, demanding it every-where.
We cannot publish it without direct authorisation from the Bureau, but publish it we must.
We are doing everything we can to raise money and hope to succeed; you too must try to raise some.
For heaven’s sake, hurry up with the authorisation to publish in the name of the Bureau, and print a leaflet about it in Russia.

To the Caucasian Union from Lenin Dear Comrades, We have just received the resolutions of your confer-ence.
264 Send us without fail a more carefully made copy— there is a lot that is undecipherable.
Without fail, too, carry out as soon as possible your splendid plan—to send your special delegate here.
Otherwise it will really be ex-tremely difficult, almost impossible, to reach agreement and remove mutual misunderstandings.
This is an urgent necessity at the present time.
You still have little knowledge of all the documents and all the dirty tricks of the Council and the Central Com-mittee.
There is not the slightest doubt that they have already side-tracked the Third Congress and will now split all the committees.
It is essential immediately 1) to set up a Bureau of the Majority Committees, 2) to entrust it with all matters concerning the congress and all leadership of the committees, 3) to support our organ Vperyod, 265 4) to publish your resolutions (do you authorise us to do this?) and an announcement about the Bureau.
Please reply quickly.
Yours, Lenin We do not understand what relationship your (Caucasian) Bureau bears to the All-Russia Bureau of the Majority Committees.

123 TO MARIA ESSEN 267 From Lenin to Nina Lvovna, private December 24, 1904 Dear Beastie, I have long been intending to write to you, but have been hard pressed for time.
We are now all in high spirits and terribly busy; yesterday the announcement concerning publication of our newspaper Vperyod came out.
The entire Majority rejoices and is heartened as never before.
At last we have stopped this sordid squabbling and shall get down to real team-work with those who want to work and not to make rows! A good group of writers has formed, we have fresh forces.
Money is scarce, but we should be getting some soon.
The Central Committee, by betraying us, has lost all credit; it has co-opted (in an underhand way) the Men-sheviks and is raising a hue and cry against the congress.
The Majority committees are uniting, they have already elected a Bureau and now the organ will cement this unity.
Hurrah! Cheer up, we’re all coming to life again.
Sooner or later, one way or another we certainly hope to see you too.
Drop me a line how you are getting on, and, above all, keep cheerful; remember, you and I are not so old yet— we have everything before us.
Affectionately yours, Lenin Sent from Geneva to Russia First published in 1 9 2 6 Printed from the original124 TO ROZALIA ZEMLYACHKA To Zemlyachka from Lenin, private December 26, 1904 Dear friend, I have received your authorisation.
In a day or two I shall be writing for the press on your business.
* I recently received also the minutes of the Northern Conference.
268 Hurrah! You have done a splendid job and you (together with Papasha, Mouse and others) are to be congratulated on a huge success.
A conference like that is a very difficult thing under Russian conditions; apparently, it has been a great success.
Its significance is tremendous; it fits in most appropriately with our announcement of our news-paper (Vperyod).
The announcement has already been is-sued.
The first number will come out at the beginning of January, new style.
The task now is: 1) To issue in Russia as quickly as possible a printed leaflet about the Bureau of the Majority Committees.
For heaven’s sake, don’t put this off even for a week.
It is devilishly important.
2) Once again to make a round of the committees of the south (and Volga), stressing the importance of giving every support to Vperyod.
Transportation will be taken care of, so long as we have Papasha.
Let him take energetic steps for passing on his heritage in case of arrest.
Get Rakhmetov away quickly from dangerous areas and send him to destination.
Be quick! When we have money, we shall send a lot of people.

YERAMASOV 270 To Monk from Lenin, private Dear Comrade, I was very glad to learn that it is now possible to establish more regular contact with you.
It would be good if you were to take advantage of this to write me a few lines about how you feel and what the immediate prospects are.
Up till now all news of you has come through intermediaries, which always makes mutual understanding rather difficult.
Throughout the year our Party affairs have been in a scandalous state, as you have probably heard.
The Minority has wrecked the Second Congress, created the new Iskra (Have you seen it? What do you think of it?) and now, when the vast majority of the committees that have expressed themselves at all have vigorously rebelled against this new Iskra, the Minority has wrecked the Third Congress as well.
It has become all too obvious to the Minority that the Party will not tolerate their organ of tittle-tattle and squabbling in the struggle, of reversion to Rabocheye Dyelo-ism in matters of principle, to the famous organisa-tion-as-process theory.
The situation now has been made clear.
The Majority committees have united (four Caucasian and the Odessa, Ekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, Tver, Northern and Nizhni-Novgorod committees).
I have begun here (with new literary forces) to publish the news-paper Vperyod (and announcement has been issued, No.
1 will appear at the beginning of January, new style).
Let us know what you think of it and whether we can count on your support, which would be extremely important for us.

This Society is sponsored by Litvinov-Fallinsky, Chizhov and Langovoi.

It will be very wel-come if you tackle local affairs more energetically.
As for my view of the arguments of the editorial board in its second “secret” leaflet 271 quoted by you, I can only say the following so far.
First of all one is struck by the glaring absurdity of “secret” when 1) there is nothing secret about it, and 2) the same ideas were repeated in No.
79 (the Ekaterinodar demonstration, the article of a correspondent, and the editors’ comment).
No.
79 is analysed in Vperyod No.
1.
* You will receive it before Monday and will see how we present the issue.
Secrecy technique by means of a leaflet nowadays is simply absurd, and I would attack it particularly sharply.
In essence, the “ideas” of the editors in this new produc-tion of theirs offer, as it were, two points of vantage: 1) Old Believer’s position, to which the editors refer and which is clarified in Iskra, and 2) playing at parliamentarism, “parades and manoeuvres”, lack of faith in the proletariat, a bashful attempt to retract on the question of panic (as much as to say, those words about panic were perhaps “superfluous” (!)).
This should be strongly emphasised Ad 1.
Old Believer’s position, which clearly emerged also in No.
77 (the leading article)—N.
B.
, N.
B.
, in my * See Lenin’s article “Good Demonstrations of Proletarians and Poor Arguments of Certain Intellectuals” (present edition, Vol.
8).
— Ed.
opinion, is sheer muddle.
I shall analyse it in the press.
272 To justify his muddled resolution he is obliged to “invent” a good bourgeoisie.
A “bourgeois democracy” is invented distinct from the Zemstvo people and liberals (as if the Zemstvo people were not bourgeois democrats!), which, practically speaking, includes the intelligentsia (by atten-tively reading No.
77 and No.
79 you will clearly see that bourgeois democracy is identified with the “radical intel-ligentsia”, “democratic intelligentsia” and “intellectualist democracy”—e.
g.
, No.
78, p.
3, column 3, 9th line up, and passim).
To class the intelligentsia, in contrast to the Zemstvo people, etc.
, as bourgeois democrats is sheer nonsense.
To call on them to become “an independent force” (No.
77, Iskra’s italics) is claptrap.
The real basis of broad democracy (the peasants, handicraftsmen, etc.
) is ignored here, as are also the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are the natural and inevitable left elements of the radical intelligentsia.
I can only outline these propositions here, as it is necessary to deal with them in greater detail in the press.
Old Believer is chockful of pretentious drivel about the “democratic intelligentsia” being the “motor nerve” (!) of liberalism, and so on.
His attempt to represent as a “new word” the term “third element”, used to describe the uplift intelligentsia, the intellectuals among the Zemstvo em-ployees, etc.
, is amusing.
See my review of home affairs in Zarya No.
2-3, where there is a whole chapter entitled “The Third Element”.
* Only the new Iskra could find a “new word” here.
It is not true that the Social-Democrats, as a vanguard, can influence only the democratic intelligentsia.
They can influence and are influencing the Zemstvo people too.
Our influence on them and on Mr.
Struve is a fact overlooked only by people enamoured of the “evident, tangible results” of gala performances.
It is untrue that, apart from the Zemstvo people and democratic intelligentsia, there is no one to influence (peas-ants, handicraftsmen, etc.
).
* See present edition, Vol.
5, pp.
281-89.
—Ed.
It is untrue that it is the intelligentsia, in contrast to the liberals, that constitutes “bourgeois democracy”.
It is untrue that the French Radicals and Italian Repub-licans have not obscured the class-consciousness of the proletariat.
It is untrue that the “agreement” (of which the editors wrote in the first leaflet) could have referred to Old Be-liever’s “conditions”.
That is absurd.
The editors are hedg-ing, clearly aware that in fact the conditions have gone by the board.
Ad 2.
In my opinion, the second point stands out par-ticularly clearly in a sentence of the second leaflet: “We should, in our view, follow our class enemy and temporary political ally in that very sphere in which they are fulfilling the role of political leader entrusted them by history, that of emancipating the nation; in this sphere the proletariat should measure its strength against the bour-geoisie”.
* This is playing at parliamentarism with a vengeance! “Measure its strength”—to what depths our despicable intellectualist gasbags degrade this great concept by reduc-ing it to the demonstration of a handful of workers at a Zemstvo meeting! What a hysterical fuss, trying to snatch an advantage from a momentary situation (just now the Zemstvo people are “in the limelight”—fire away about the sphere in which they fulfil the role entrusted them by history! For pity’s sake, gentlemen! Don’t talk so pretty!).
“Full contact of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie that is politically in the limelight.
” What can be “fuller” than that! “Argufying” with the Mayor, of Ekaterinodar him-self! The defence of the idea about the “highest type of mobi-lisation” is not quite clear, for here you are paraphrasing and not quoting.
But this idea contains the key to their confusion.
The distinction between an “ordinary”, and a “political demonstration” (does the second leaflet really say that in so many words? Is it a printed leaflet? Can you get a copy? a specimen?) is a real gem.
This, I think, is where the opponent should be brought to bay, for it is * The italics are Lenin’s.
—Ed.
here that he comes to grief.
It is not demonstrations in the Zemstvos that are bad, but high-faulting judgements about the highest type that are fatuous.
I shall leave it at that for the time being.

Really, he acts towards us like the Osvobozhdeniye people 278 or priest Gapon 279 towards the Social-Democrats.
I have just been looking at the table of our correspondence with Russia.
280 Gusev sent us six letters in ten days, but Rakhmetov two in thirty days.
What do you think of that? Not a sign of him.
Not a line for Vperyod.
Not a word about the work, plans and connections.

No.

And no one arranged for good and full letters about the Ninth of January! 281 I have had no reply whatever to my letter to Rakhmetov about literary contributions! * Neither is there anything about the Bureau and the con-gress.

We shall send a copy of this letter to the Executive Committee of the German Social-Democratic Party.
The Third Congress of our Party will be convened by the Russian Bureau of the Majority Committees.
The Vperyod editorial board and the Bureau are only provisional central bodies.
At the present time, neither I nor any of the edit-ors, contributors or supporters of Vperyod known to me can assume the responsibility of taking any new, important steps binding on the whole Party without a Party Congress decision.

GUSEV 285 To Khariton February 15, 1905 Dear friend, Many thanks for the letters.
Be sure to keep this up, but bear in mind this: 1) never restrict yourself to making a precis of letters or reports handed over to you but be sure to send them on (apart from your own letters) in full; 2) be sure to put us in direct touch with new forces, with the youth, with newly-formed circles.
Don’t forget that the strength of a revolutionary organisation lies in the number of its connections.
We should measure the efficiency and results of our friends’ work by the number of new Rus-sian connections passed on to us.
So far not one of the St.
Petersburgers (shame on them) has given us a single new Russian connection (neither Serafima, nor Sysoika, nor Zemlyachka, nor Nik.

Remember, in the event of your being arrested we shall be in low water unless you have obtained for us a dozen or so new, young, loyal friends of Vperyod, who are able to work, able to keep in contact, and able to carry on corres-pondence even without you.
Remember that! A professional revolutionary must build up dozens of new connections in each locality, put all the work into their hands while he is with them, teach them and bring them up to the mark not by lecturing them but by work.
Then he should go to another place and after a month or two return to check upon the young people who have replaced him.
I assure you that there is a sort of idiotic, philistine, Oblomov-like fear of the youth among us.
I implore you: fight this fear with all your might.

GUSEV February 25, 1905 We have just this moment learnt from Lyadov’s letter that the C.
C.
has agreed to a congress.
286 I adjure the Bureau by all that is holy not to believe the C.
C.
and not on any account to relinquish a single jot of their complete independence in convening the congress.
The Bureau has no right to yield an inch to the C.
C.
If it does we here will raise a revolt and all the rock-firm committees will be with us.
The C.

has been invited to the congress, and let it come with the Mensheviks, but we and we alone are con-vening the congress.
Vperyod No.

For heaven’s sake, do everything to ensure that this letter is forwarded quickly to Lyadov, Sysoika and Zemlyachka.

GUSEV To Nation Dear friend, Thanks tremendously for the letters.
You are simply rescuing us from the effects of our foreign environment.
Be sure to keep it up.
For heaven’s sake, obtain correspond-ence from the workers themselves.
Why don’t they write? It’s a downright disgrace! Your detailed account of the Com-mittee’s agitation at the elections to the Shidlovsky Com-mission 287 is magnificent.
We shall print it.
One more question: did you accept on the Committee the six workers mentioned? Reply without fail.
We advise you by all means to accept workers on the Committee, to the extent of one-half at least.
Unless you do this you will not be fortified against the Mensheviks, who will send strong reinforcements from here.
No one from the Bureau writes about the congress.
This worries us, for Mermaid’s optimism (and partly yours) that the C.
C.
’s consent to the congress is a gain, inspires grave misgivings.
To us it is as clear as daylight that the C.
C.
wanted to fool you.
You should be a pessimist as far as the C.
C.
is concerned.
Don’t believe it, for Christ’s sake! Make the most of the moment to induce the Minority com-mittees, especially those of the “Marsh”, to turn up.
It’s tremendously important to give special attention to Kiev, Rostov and Kharkov; we know that there are Vperyod sup-porters, workers and intellectuals, in all these three centres.
At all costs delegates from these committees should be brought to the congress with a consultative voice.
* The * Write all this to Mermaid and Demon.
same applies to the Moscow print-workers.
Altogether it is most deplorable that the Bureau did not publish our decision to have the workers’ organisations invited to the congress: this is a tremendous mistake.
Rectify it quickly and without fail.
I strongly advise carrying out agitation among all the 300 organised workers in St.
Petersburg for sending one or two delegates to the congress with a consultative voice at their own expense.
The idea will no doubt appeal to the workers, and they will set to work with a will.
Don’t forget that the Mensheviks will try their damnedest to discredit the congress in the eyes of the workers by saying: there were no workers present.
This has to be taken into consid-eration and special attention must be paid to workers’ representation.
The workers of St.
Petersburg will certainly collect three hundred rubles for two workers’ delegates (or some Maecenas will make a special donation for it)— agitation among the workers for sending the cap round will have a tremendous effect, everyone will know of it.
This would be of enormous importance.
Be sure to read this in the Committee and at meetings of organisers and agitat-ors.
Do all our organisers and agitators speak to the workers about direct connections with Vperyod? All the very best.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
Both Bureau leaflets (No.
1 on an uprising and No.
2 on the attitude towards the liberals) are excellent and we are reprinting them in full in Vperyod.
288 If only they were to keep this up! By the way: why has the writ-ers’ group declared that it belongs to the organisation of the St.
Petersburg Committee? The reason this is not advisable is this.
A writers’ group attached to the Com-mittee would have no mandate to the congress.
If it was a special group, not belonging to any committee, but an all-Russia “writers’ group belonging to the Russian S.
D.
L.
P.
”, it would have the right (with the Bureau’s per-mission) to send a delegate with a consultative voice.
Ar-range this, please! We shall not publish the fact that it is a group attached to the St.
Petersburg Committee.
Let1) the S.
P.
C.
part with it; 2) let it become a separate and special group at least for a time; 3) let it “submit a request” (there’s bureaucracy for you!) for its delegate to be admitted to the congress with a consultative voice; 4) let the Bureau give permission.
I can’t believe that a dozen writers will be unable to raise 200 rubles for a delegate! I’m sure it would be useful to have their delegate at the congress (for example, Rumyantsev or someone else).
Inform the Bureau of this or, better still, do all this yourself without any reports at all.

GUSEV To Nation from Lenin March 11, 1905 Dear friend, I have just received Nos.
10 and 11.
* Many thanks, particularly for the scolding in No.
10.
I love to hear people scold—it means they know what they are doing and have a line to follow.
You’ve given the “old wolf ” a proper trimming; the mere perusal of it made him scratch him-self.
No.
11, though, showed that you are far too optimistic if you hope so easily to come to terms with the St.
Peter-sburg Mensheviks.
Oh, I fear the Danaans 289 and advise you to do the same! Have you noticed that everything that is not to their advantage remains a matter of words, undoc-umented—for example, the C.
C.
’s agreeing to a congress.
Issue No.
89 of Iskra appeared today with the Council’s decision of March 8, 1905, against a congress—a lying, rag-ing decision (“by acting the way they do, the participants in a congress place themselves outside the Party”), which gives the number of “qualified Party organisations, apart from the central bodies”, as of January 1, 1905, as thirty-three (a shameless lie, non-existent committees, like that of the Kuban and the unendorsed Kazan Committee, have been invented, while in the case of two others, those of Polesye and the North-West, the date has been mixed up, January 1, 1905, being stated instead of April 1, 1905).
Clearly there can be no question of the Council’s participation in the congress, nor, consequently, of the League and the Central Organ.
I’m very glad of this, and I don’t believe that the * Gusev’s letters to Lenin.
—Ed.
Mensheviks in Russia will go; I don’t believe it.
So far not one of you has sent us a single written statement of a single Menshevik committee agreeing to a congress.
Be under no illusion! If the St.
Petersburg Mensheviks agree to make concessions, demand from them, as a conditio sine qua non, recognition of the congress to be convened by the Bureau, and recognition of the St.
Petersburg Committee as the only legal committee connected with the working-class movement —to be given in writing, and copies to be sent to Vperyod without fail (over their own signatures) and on behalf of all the members, specified by name, of the St.
Petersburg Minority group.
Even then do not allow them any contacts at all—otherwise you will win yourselves internal ene-mies, mark my words! Inform Rakhmetov immediately by express telegram that around March 20, 1905, there will be a most important conference here with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and a host of other parties about an agreement for an uprising 290 —Rakhmetov’s presence is essential, let him come post-haste and lose no time.
In conclusion I tell you once again: you do not know the Minority forces throughout Russia and are under an illu-sion.
This is a mistake.
The Mensheviks at present are strong-er than we are; it’s going to be a long and hard fight.
The icons abroad 291 raise a heap of money.
I consider it simply indecent for us to raise the question of an agree-ment with the Bund, etc.
, after their (and the Lettish) conference with the C.
C.
292 (minutes in Posledniye Izves-tia 293 and in Iskra No.
89).
It would be idiocy; it would look as if we were thrusting ourselves upon them.
We shall be told: we don’t know you, we have already reached agree-ment with the C.
C.
It will end in disgrace, believe me! All the very best.

GUSEV To Gusev from Lenin March 16, 1905 Dear friend, I have just learnt that, at the request of the Bund, the conference here of eighteen Social-Democratic and other revolutionary parties (including the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the P.
P.
S.
) has been postponed to the beginning of April.
It is extremely important for us to settle jointly with Rakhmetov a number of fundamental questions con-cerning our participation in this conference (its aim is to reach agreement on an uprising).
Iskra is carrying on a most vile intrigue.
If Rakhmetov has not left yet, make every effort to see that he goes immediately, and let me know at once without fail exactly what you know about the time of his departure.
We are pretty worried here about the congress.
It’s all very well for you, Igor and Lyadov to write about the Old Man being nervy.
Who wouldn’t be nervy when we are surrounded here by enemies who take advantage of every item of news and who get their news more quickly than we do.
Really, this is unpardonable on the part of the Bureau.
As regards the East, for example, all we know is that Zem-lyachka is touring the Urals and that Lyadov visited Sa-ratov.
The reply from the latter place is vague, nothing definite.
We do not know what arrangements have been made for publishing leaflets over the signature of the “Com-mittees of the Eastern District”.
It is a disgrace and a scan-dal! Recently the Socialist-Revolutionaries showed us one such leaflet, a stupid one, against Gapon! Obviously, this is a C.
C.
intrigue, but surely two members of the Bureau whovisited the East could have learnt something and written us about it in good time, so as not to put us in an idiotic position in face of the enemy! Don’t they feel ashamed at putting Vperyod in such an extremely awkward position? And more than awkward, because Iskra brazenly takes advantage of everything.
In Iskra No.
89 the Council excom-municates everyone who goes to the congress.
The votes are again falsified there.
They count 75 votes as of January 1, 1905 (33 9 2 = 66 & 9 from the C.
C.
, Central Organ and Council).
They have invented the Kazan and Kuban com-mittees, which were never endorsed, and lie about the Po-lesye and North-Western committees having been endorsed as of January 1, 1905.
Actually, they were not endorsed until April 1, 1905.
We exposed this lie in Vperyod No.
10.
* Here is something that should be borne in mind: for the congress to be lawful from Iskra’s point of view, there must be nineteen committees attending it.
By our reckoning, this is wrong.
But if there were 28 (apart from the League) fully qualified organisations in Russia as of January 1, 1905, then the participation of 14-15 at the congress is extremely desirable, almost essential.
Meanwhile, we have 13 — 1 (Ekaterinoslav) & 2 (Voronezh and Tula) = 14, and that only by counting Tiflis, a doubtful.
Of course, the congress is necessary all the same, if only of a dozen committees, and the sooner the better.
Any kind of congress, so long as it is a congress.
But why is there no news of the Bureau having visited a single neutral or Menshevik committee? Was it not decided that the Bureau would invite and visit all of them? Why hasn’t Lyadov visited the Kuban Com-mittee? Why, in travelling through, did he not invite to the congress the Don, Kharkov, Gornozavodsky and Kiev committees? And the various groups in these towns? An excellent means of stirring the workers is to invite them to the congress themselves.
Why isn’t this being done? It would really have enormous significance! Why isn’t there a scrap of news about Kursk, the Polesye Committee and others? We shall do everything we can from here, but not * See “Whom Are They Trying to Fool?” (present edition, Vol.
8).
— Ed.
much can be done from here.
There are slight chances of making contact with Kazan, Siberia, Kursk, Polesye, and Saratov, but all this is problematical.
And yet, if all these five, plus the Urals, were at the congress, then its full law-fulness, even according to Iskra’s reckoning, would be beyond doubt.
Do write.

To the Odessa Committee from Lenin Dear friends, I should like to say a few words to you about congress delegates.
If you are sending them from Russia, then my letter does not apply.
But I heard that you are thinking of giving a mandate to one of the people here.
If this rumour is true, then I would advise giving mandates to both of your candidates here, i.
e.
, to Josephine and Danila—one with a vote and the other with a consultative voice (i.
e.
, write a letter to the congress that the Odessa Committee requests the congress to let Josephine attend with a con-sultative voice, as a member of the Southern Bureau and a very useful worker in a consultative capacity, or, for example, Danila, as having an excellent knowledge of the local areas and having worked with remarkable energy among the Odessa proletariat).
You may rest assured that the congress will grant such a request from the Committee.
Please read this letter to all the Committee members and send me a reply.
294 P.
S.
Are you taking workers into the Committee? This is essential, absolutely essential! Why don’t you put us in direct contact with workers? Not a single worker writes to Vperyod.
This is a scandal.
We need at all costs dozens of worker correspondents.

GUSEV To be handed to Gusev from Lenin, private April 4, 1905 Dear friend, You wrote yourself that you were now being shadowed.
What’s more, I have gathered information fully confirming this fact from St.
Petersburgers who have recently arrived from the scene of activities.
There can be no doubt at all about it.
I know from my own experience and from that of lots of comrades that one of the most difficult things for a revolutionary is to leave a danger spot in good time.
Whenever the time comes to drop work in a given locality, that work becomes particularly interesting and particularly needed; so it seems always to the person concerned.
I consid-er it my duty, therefore, to demand of you most insistently that you abandon St.
Petersburg for a time.
This is abso-lutely essential.
No excuses of any kind, no considerations for the work, should put off this step.
The harm caused by an inevitable arrest will be enormous.
The harm caused by going away will be insignificant, and merely apparent.
Advance young assistants for a time, for a month or two, to fill the top posts, and rest assured that, with an extreme-ly brief and temporary setback, the cause, on the whole, will gain by it tremendously.
The young people will acquire more experience in key posts, and any mistakes they may make will be speedily corrected by us.
An arrest, how-ever, would ruin all our major opportunities for organising central work.
Once more, I insistently advise going out immediately to the provinces for a month.
There’s heaps of work to be done everywhere, and everywhere general guid-ance is needed.
If there is a will to go (and a will there must be) the thing can always be arranged.
I’m not writing anything about the agreement of March 12, 1905.
295 Cursing will do no good.
I suppose they could not act otherwise.
The thing now is to prepare energetically for the congress and to increase the number of delegates.
Don’t be too free with money, take care of it; it will be needed more than ever after the congress.
Sent from Geneva to St.
Petersburg First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original138 TO OLGA VINOGRADOVA 296 To Beggar from Lenin Dear Comrade, I have read with interest your letter 297 (No.
6) about the primary nucleus of the organisation among handicraft workers.
At the factories this nucleus should be represented by the factory committee, but what about the handicraft industries? You stand for trade union circles, but what about your opponents—? I didn’t quite grasp what they stand for.
Neither do I know, unfortunately, what these old trade union “councils” were.
When did they exist? How were they formed? How did they combine Social-Democratic and trade union work? Not being familiar with the practical aspect of this prac-tical question, I hesitate to express an opinion as yet.
Fur-ther letters may tell me more—then we shall see.
One must study experience and be careful in changing things, that is true.
But it’s not quite clear to me what Economism has to do with it.
Don’t the factory committees, too, mainly dis-cuss factory interests (which are also trade union interests)? Yet no one has objected to the factory committee being the primary nucleus of the Social-Democratic organisation.
The important thing is living conditions, conditions of as-sembly, conditions under which people meet, conditions of joint work, because the primary nucleus should meet frequently and regularly and function in a particularly lively fashion.
Finally, is a single type of organisation obligatory here? Would not a variety of types be better for adaptation to various conditions and for acquiring richer experience?Thanks for the letters.
Keep on writing, for it is not often we have news about the day-to-day (the most interesting) aspect of the work.
Lenin Written April 8, 1 9 0 5 Sent from Geneva to Odessa First published in 1 9 2 5 Printed from the original139 TO THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU To the Secretariat of the International Socialist Bureau Geneva, July 8, 1905 Dear Comrades, Your letter of July 6 somewhat surprised us.
You should already have known that Citizen Plekhanov is no longer the representative of the Russian Social-Democratic Party in the International Socialist Bureau.
In Iskra No.
101, Citizen Plekhanov published the follow-ing letter, which we translate literally, and which, one would think, he should have brought to the notice of the Bureau: “Comrades, the decisions of the conference [of the breakaway sec-tion of the Party], 298 which have dealt a mortal blow to the central institutions of our Party, compel me to divest myself of the title of editor of the Central Organ and fifth member of the Council (elected by the Second, lawful Congress).

only if this is the wish of both sections.
“Montreux, May 29, 1905.
” The editorial board of Proletary, 300 the Central Organ of the Party, replied to this statement of Citizen Plekha-nov’s with the following paragraph, published in No.
5, for June 13, 1905: “In regard to Comrade Plekhanov’s postscript we can state that the question of the Party’s representation in theInternational Bureau by Comrade Plekhanov has now been submitted to the C.
C.
of the Party for its decision.
” The question has not yet been settled and, consequently, at the present time Citizen Plekhanov cannot, in the capac-ity of representative of the Party, 301 sign any document emanating from the International Bureau.
In view of this we draw your attention, dear comrades, to the fact that it is very inconvenient for us to commu-nicate with the Bureau through a comrade who himself declares publicly that he cannot represent the Party so long as it does not definitely authorise him to do so.
We again repeat our request to the International Secretariat that, pending settlement of the question of representation in the International Socialist Bureau, everything that con-cerns us (letters, manifestoes, documents, funds, etc.
) should be sent to the address of the Party’s Central Com-mittee (V.
Oulianoff, Rue de la Colline, 3, Genève).

From Lenin to the members of the C.
C.
, private July 11, 1905 Dear friends, A number of letters from all over Russia, Alexandrov’s news, a talk with Tick and several other new arrivals— all this strengthens my conviction that there is some internal defect in the work of the C.
C.
, a defect of organi-sation, in the way the work is arranged.
The general opinion is that there is no Central Committee, that it does not make itself felt, that no one notices it.
And the facts confirm this There is no evidence of the C.
C.
’s political guidance of the Party.
Yet all the C.
C.
members are working themselves to death! What’s the matter? In my opinion, one of the principal causes of it is that there are no regular C.
C.
leaflets.
Leadership by means of talks and personal contacts at a time of revolution is sheer utopianism.
Leadership must be public.
All other forms of work must be wholly and unconditionally subordi-nated to this form.
A responsible C.
C.
litterateur should concern himself first of all with writing (or obtaining from contributors—though the editor himself should always be prepared to write) a leaflet twice a week on Party and po-litical topics (the liberals, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Minority, the split, the Zemstvo delegation, the trade unions, etc.
, etc.
) and republishing it in every way, imme-diately mimeographing in 50 copies (if there is no printing-press) and circulating it to the committees for republication Articles in Proletary could, perhaps, sometimes be used l for such leaflets—after a certain amount of revision.
I can-not understand why this is not being done! Can Schmidtand Werner have forgotten our talks on this? Surely it is possible to write and circulate at least one leaflet a week? The Report on the Third Congress * has not been re-printed 302 in full anywhere in Russia all this time.
It is so outrageous, such a fiasco for all the C.
C.
’s famous “tech-niques” that I simply cannot understand what Winter was thinking about, what Sommer and the others are thinking about! After all, are there not committee print-shops in existence? Apparently, the C.
C.
members completely fail to under-stand the tasks of “keeping in the public eye”.
Yet without that there is no centre, there is no Party! They are working themselves to the bone, but they are working like moles, at secret rendezvous, at meetings, with agents, etc.
, etc.
It is a sheer waste of strength! If you are short-handed, then put third-rate forces on the job, even tenth-rate ones, but attend to the political leadership yourselves, issue leaflets first and foremost.
And then—personal appearances and speeches at district meetings (in Polesye no one attend-ed the meeting.
A scandal.
They all but broke away!), at conferences, etc.
Something like a C.
C.
diary should be published, a C.
C.
bulletin, and every important question should be dealt with in a leaflet issued twice a week.
It is not difficult to publish one: 50 copies can be run off on a hectograph and circulated, one of the committees can print it and have copies sent to us.
The thing is to act, to act all the time openly, to stop being dumb.
Otherwise we here, too, are completely cut off.
Perhaps the C.
C.
should be enlarged? Half a dozen more agents taken on? People could be found for this, I’m sure.
In fact, I want to suggest a practical step right now: in view of the almost total absence of correspondence between the C.
C.
members (we have had only two letters from Werner and Winter, and from Alexandrov only news from the road, “travel impressions”, nothing more), it is absolutely essential to carry out our joint decision of May 10, 1905, concerning the holding of a meeting by September 1, 1905.
303 For heaven’s sake, don’t put this off, don’t be stingy about spending 200-300 rubles.
Without this, there is a great * See present edition, Vol.

danger that we shall not be able to set things going properly.
At the moment they are not moving at all.
This is evident from all reports.
There are still six weeks to go to September 1.
It is pos-sible to wind up affairs and make arrangements for a trip in good time, after corresponding among others with Ale-xandrov as to who should go.
I await a reply.

From Lenin to the C.
C.
Dear friends, In regard to your recent letters I should say that I agree with all the decisions except two.
1) I emphatically protest against the appointment of Matryona as an agent and ear-nestly request you to revise it.
He is a muddle-headed fellow, who can cause us great harm, desert us a dozen times, put us to shame by his stupidity, etc.
Let him work in the Committee—as an agent he is no good at all, unless you put him on a “technique” job.
As regards Stanislav, please let me know who he is, tell me more about him.
For my part I would strongly recommend Lalayants as an agent.
In Odes-sa and the Southern Bureau he displayed outstanding abili-ty as an organiser; according to the general opinion he has got real live work going there.
He was the guiding spirit of all the local work—so a number of Odessites reported, some of whom were anything but favourably disposed towards the “rockfirm”.
Last but not least he is a man of exceptionally high principle.
2) Regarding Plekhanov, I am extremely surprised at your silence on a question that had been raised here in Winter’s time.
Have we the right to ap-point as the representative of the Party someone who does not want to come into the Party and refuses to recognise the Third Congress? He has now declared in print that he does not consider the Third Congress lawful and will act as representative only of both sections.
A number of comrades here had pointed out, when Winter was still here, that, in appointing Plekhanov, we would only pamper him and spoil him altogether.
I was in favour of Plekhanov at first, but I now see that he can only be appointed on certainconditions.
Just imagine concretely what it will mean to have as our representative on the Bureau someone to whom no one speaks, and who cannot be made to “represent” the C.
C.
and not himself! We have now at last secured direct contact between the Bureau (the I.
S.
B.
) and us, and we see that there are quite a number of small business mat-ters, financial and others (requests on behalf of Russia and concerning Russia, about which I wrote to them recently; the method of representation, about which they asked me a few days ago, etc.
).
The Bureau wrote about another “pro-posal of Bebel’s” 304 (which has not yet reached us); evident-ly, the old fellow is out to “make peace” again (Kautsky has published a mean article in connection with the Ger-man edition of the “Report” 305 ).
Think what our position will be if Plekhanov is the representative and Plekhanov has to deal with Bebel on the question of “peace”! I under-stand very well what strong reasons there are to make us all, and especially you, desire “peace”, desire the appoint-ment of Plekhanov, but I have become convinced that such a step, without a real guarantee of peace, will be only a false step, will confuse the issue still more, will cause new splits, violations of agreements, altercations and fresh resentment, and will only make unity more remote.
In my opinion, all the talk about unity will be so much empty phrase-making so long as a realisable plan for it has not been worked out from experience; things are going in this direction, we must wait a few months, let everyone assess the absurdity of the decisions of the conference, let experience destroy their idiotic “organisational statute”, let experience cut down their claims (for, in general, things are going better with us, and we are obviously going forward to victory)— and then direct negotiations will be started between the central bodies without intermediaries, then we shall work out (whether at once or after two or three attempts, I do not undertake to say, of course) a modus vivendi.
But now it is necessary to fight.
My proposal is to make a “proposal” to Plekhanov on your lines, but on condition that he is willing to recognise the Third Congress, come into the Party and submit to its decisions.
By such a step we shall observe the conventions and eliminate any possible confusion.
Pending your reply I shall not propose anything to Ple-khanov.
I earnestly beg you to postpone a decision until we meet in September.
I am extremely surprised that you write nothing about the “Open Letter” 306 written by Reinert that was sent to me.
I don’t understand the why and wherefor.
Why is there not a word about this in the decisions? Write quickly whether it is to be published in the Central Organ.
If it is, then I should like very much to ask for a slight alteration concerning tactical differences so that it may not come into contradiction with my pamphlet, which Lyubich will tell you about.
307 I hope we shall see eye to eye on this and, if possible, I would ask to be allowed to make this altera-tion myself.
I am extremely surprised that the “Report” is not being issued in Russia in full.
It’s scandalous! Make all the tech-nical staff hurry up with this, for heaven’s sake! We are extremely grateful for the detailed decisions, letters from committees and leaflets you have sent us.
At long last something like regular contacts between us are being established! Please, don’t drop this custom and find a good St.
Petersburg secretary.
We are badly in need of information from St.
Petersburg about Party affairs, the liberals, questions of Party life that are being discussed in the circles, etc.
, etc.
Do not forget that the Bund and the Mensheviks are better informed than we are here! All the very best.

1 July 28, 1905 Dear friends, The two following important questions must be decided as quickly as possible: 1) The question of Plekhanov.
We have instructed a special agent (Lyadov) to tell you how the matter stands.
I shall repeat it briefly.
Plekhanov acted with incredible impudence by writing to the Inter-national Socialist Bureau that both sections of the Party had recognised (!) him, and in every way denouncing and denigrating our Third Congress.
I have a copy of his letter sent to me from the Bureau.
It will be sent on to you.
With great difficulty I established direct contact with the In-ternational Socialist Bureau and refuted Plekhanov.
Ple-khanov then refused to be the representative.
You know that I was by no means unconditionally opposed to Ple-khanov’s appointment, but now it would be quite unthinka-ble.
It would be such a disavowal of me that my position would become impossible.
It would discredit us altogether in the eyes of the International Socialist Bureau.
Do not forget that almost all the Social-Democrats abroad are on the side of the “icons” and think nothing of us, look down on us.
An incautious step on your part will spoil everything.
Therefore I earnestly request Werner and Schmidt to con-firm, as quickly as possible, if only provisionally, the steps I have taken.
That is one thing.
Secondly, Plekhanov should be offered a scientific organ in the name of the C.
C.
of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, but on condition that he recognise the Third Congress and all its decisions as binding on him.
If he turns this down, the blame will fall on him, while we shall have demonstrated our conciliatory spirit.
If he accepts, we shall take a further step to meet him.
And so: I earnest-ly advise you to rescind the decision about representation,and, as regards the scientific organ, to draft the proposal with the above condition.
308 2) About the proposal for mediation on the part of the International Socialist Bureau.
The full text will be sent to you, although Lyadov has al-ready taken it for you.
For the purpose of reconciliation, the International Socialist Bureau proposes a conference between us and the Minority, under the chairmanship of members of the I.
S.
Bureau.
The foreign Social-Democrats (Bebel and others) are strongly urging the I.
S.
B.
to bring pressure to bear on us.
Letters of this kind have come even from the British (the Social-Democratic Federation; I have a copy of the letter, in the usual conciliatory vein, about it being a crime to quarrel at such a time, etc.
309 ).
I wrote to the I.
S.
Bureau that it was not within my competence to settle this question, and that the decision had to come from the whole C.
C.
, to which, I said, I was writing im-mediately.
Then I enquired whether they had in mind me-diation only, or a court of arbitration that was binding on both sides; it was important for me, I said, to write on this point to the C.
C.
So far there is no reply from them.
My opinion is as follows.
The conference should certainly be agreed to.
It should be fixed for round about September 1.
We should send to it without fail one or two C.
C.
members from Russia (do not forget that our meeting is fixed for September 1, and that it is extremely necessary in all re-spects).
Mediation should be accepted with thanks.
A bind-ing decision by arbitration should be refused on the strength of the Third Congress resolution, 310 which has bound us unconditionally and which states that the conditions for complete amalgamation with the Minority should be sub-mitted to the Fourth Congress for confirmation.
The Third Congress instructed us to prepare and work out these con-ditions, but not to endorse them finally.
In fulfilment of the instruction of the Third Congress, we accept mediation and will try to work out a fully detailed modus for agree-ment now and for gradual amalgamation.
If we can manage it, we shall implement the agreement at once, and submit the plan for amalgamation to the Fourth Congress, which will then have to be convened at the same time and in the same place with the obligatory attendance of all Minority organisations.
It is extremely important to bear in mindthat the Mensheviks have no central body whose decisions are binding on them.
Iskra is not subordinated to the Or-ganisation Committee.
We should not play the role of fools entering into an agreement with people who have neither the right nor the power to speak for the whole Minority.
It is essential therefore to make it clear at once that the delegates from the Minority at the meeting with the I.
S.
Bu-reau should be both from the Organisation Committee and from Iskra, and in addition should promise to invite the opin-ions of all Minority organisations as soon as possible, giving a list of them to us.
Incidentally, if from the point of view of Russia it is of more importance to you that the Mensheviks of Russia should preponderate, then you will discuss whether special Iskra delegates are necessary.
You will know best.
But do not forget that without the consent of Iskra all agree-ments will be a fiction.
One more question: should we in-form the I.
S.
Bureau of the secret resolution of the Third Congress? Have we the right to do so? I am in doubt about this.
Of course, informing the European socialist comrades is not “publishing”, and they can be made to undertake not to publish.
But is this advisable? Decide for yourselves.
It is easy to give a satisfactory explanation even without inform-ing them about the Third Congress resolution which binds us.
I shall publish the open letter to the Organisation Com-mittee in Proletary No.
11 (No.
10 is already coming out).
I did not publish it earlier because I was waiting for an explanation from you, which only arrived yesterday.
We earnestly request you to make a note on each document whether it is to be published and published immediately.
And so, reply as soon as possible on behalf of Werner and Schmidt at any rate: 1) Will you write the reply to the I.
S.
Bureau yourselves or do you instruct me to do so? 2) Do you approve my reply or not? 3) If not, I would ask you to hurry up with a reply, so that we can reach full agree-ment; any misunderstanding in such a matter, lack of clarity or lack of information, is fraught with the greatest danger.

LUNACHARSKY 311 August 2, 1905 Dear An.
Vas.
, Yesterday I sent you a “business” letter and asked for Iskra No.
105 * and Plekhanov’s L.
Feuerbach ** to be sent to you.
Today I’d like to talk to you on things other than cur-rent petty business.
Our people in Geneva are down in the dumps.
It’s sur-prising how little is needed for people who are not quite self-dependent and not used to independent political work, to lose heart and start moping.
And our Geneva Bolsheviks are terrible mopers.
A serious struggle is on, which the Third Congress, of course, did not put an end to and merely opened a new phase of it; the Iskrists are lively busybodies, brazen as hucksters, well skilled by long experience in demagogy—whereas among our people a kind of “conscien-tious stupidity” or “stupid conscientiousness” prevails.
They can’t put up a fight, they’re awkward, inactive, clum-sy, timid.
.
.
.
They’re good fellows, but no damn’d good whatever as politicians.
They lack tenacity, fighting spirit, nimbleness and speed.
Vas.
Vas.
is extremely typical in this respect: a charming fellow, an utterly devoted worker and honest man, but he’ll never make a politician, I’m afraid.
He’s much too kind—one can hardly believe that the “Galyorka” pamphlets were written by him.
He brings * The leading article is said to be utter piffle! Will you write something against it as quickly as possible? If you agree, send a tele-gram.
** Meaning Plekhanov’s preface to the second Russian edition of Engels’s pamphlet Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical Ger-man Philosophy.
—Ed.
no fighting spirit either to the newspaper (he is always re-gretting that I do not allow him to write kind articles about the Bund!) or to the colony.
A spirit of despondency reigns and I am for ever being reproached (I have only been three weeks in the country, and travel to town for four to five hours three and sometimes four times a week!) because things are not going well with them, because the Mensheviks are smarter, etc.
, etc.
! And our C.
C.
, for one thing, is not much of a “politi-cian” either, it’s much too kind, it, too, suffers from a lack of tenacity, resourcefulness and sensitivity, from inability to take political advantage of every trifle in the Party strug-gle.
Secondly, it has a lofty contempt for us “foreigners” and keeps all the best people away from us or takes them from here.
And we here abroad, find ourselves behindhand.
There is not enough ferment, stimulus or impulse.
People are incapable of acting and fighting by themselves.
We are short of speakers at our meetings.
There is no one to pour cheer into people, to raise key issues, no one capable of lifting them above the Geneva marsh into the sphere of more serious interests and problems.
And the whole work suffers.
In political struggle a halt is fatal.
There are thou-sands of demands and they are continually increasing.
The new-Iskrists are not dozing (they have now “inter-cepted” the sailors 312 who arrived in Geneva, have enticed them, probably by their usual political showmanship and overloud marktschreien * , “utilising” post facto the Odessa events for the benefit of their coterie).
We are impossibly short of people.
I don’t know when Vas.
Vas.
intends to write, but as a speaker and political centre he is beneath criticism.
He is more likely to spread despondency among people than to rouse them and call them to order.
Schwarz is absent; he writes from over there zealously and well, even better than he did here, I should say, but that’s all he does.
As for personally exercising an influence on people and being able to direct them and meetings, he is rarely capable of doing that even when in Geneva.
It is a large, important centre here.
There are lots of Russians.
Crowds of travellers.
Summer is an especially busy time, for among * Mountebank crying of wares.
—Ed.
the multitude of Russian tourists coming to Geneva there is a certain percentage of people who should and could be made use of, aroused, drawn in and guided.
Think it over and write to me in greater detail (preferably to my private address: 3.
Rue David Dufour).
Do you re-member writing me that your absence from Geneva would be no loss, because you wrote a lot even from afar.
You do write a lot, and we keep the newspaper going somehow (just somehow and no more, though we desperately need a lot more).
But not only is there a loss, but a tremendous loss, which is felt more and more sharply every day.
Person-al influence and speaking at meetings make all the differ-ence in politics.
Without them there is no political activity and even writing itself becomes less political.
Faced by an enemy who has powerful forces abroad, we are losing more ground each week than we can probably make up in a month.
The fight for the Party is not over, and it will not be brought to real victory without straining every nerve.

All the best.

C.
August 14, 1905 Dear friends, I have just read in Iskra No.
107 the minutes of the meet-ing of July 12, 1905, between the C.
C.
and the Organisation Committee.
313 It is most regrettable that so far the prom-ised minutes have not been received from you.
There have been no letters either.
Really, it is impossible to work in this way.
I knew nothing about the plan to issue the “Open Letter” or the plan of negotiations, or the plan for some sort of concessions.
Is such an attitude to a member of the collegium permissible? Think of the position you put me in! The position is absolutely impossible, for it is precisely here, abroad, that I have to answer everybody frankly—you will admit this yourself on calm reflection.
Your reply to the Organisation Committee gives rise to a number of perplexities.
I can’t make out whether you are trying to be cunning or what? Can you have forgotten that there is the straightforward resolution of the Third Congress that the terms of unification must be endorsed by a new congress? How could one talk seriously of co-opting to the C.
C.
when there are two rival organs? How could one leave unanswered the toleration of two central organs, i.
e.
, a complete violation both of the Rules and of the decisions of the Third Congress? How was it possible not to present the Mensheviks with a principled ultimatum on the organi-sational question: (1) congresses instead of plebiscites as the supreme organ of the Party; (2) unconditional subordi-nation of Party literature to the Party; (3) direct elections to the C.
C.
; (4) subordination of the minority to the major-ity, etc.
?Haven’t you taken warning from the unfortunate exam-ple of the transportation “agreement”, which was immedi-ately wrecked by Frockcoat, causing so much fresh bitter-ness? 314 Nothing can do such harm to the cause of future unity as a fictitious agreement which satisfies no one and leaves grounds for a struggle; such an “agreement” will inevitably lead to a new rupture and redoubled bitterness! Or are you being cunning? Are you hoping to “take in” the Organisation Committee, or to set the Mensheviks in Russia at loggerheads with those abroad? Has there not been sufficient experience on this score, proving the futility of such attempts? I repeat in all seriousness: you are putting me in an im-possible position.
I am not exaggerating.
I earnestly request you to answer these questions: 1) shall we have the meet-ing on September 1, as we decided, or have you rescinded this decision? 2) if you have rescinded it, then how, when and where will your meeting (of C.
C.
members) be held and what measures do you intend to take to enable me to cast my vote and (what is much more important) discover your real intentions.
A meeting is devilishly necessary on a thousand matters.
We have no money.
The Germans, for some reason, are not giving any.
If you do not send 3,000 rubles, we shall go under.
Practically all the minutes have been set up, 315 1,500 rubles are needed for the pub-lication.
The treasury is empty as never before.
What is this resolution of the Orel-Bryansk Committee? (Iskra No.
106.
) 316 There is some muddle here.
For heaven’s sake, tell us what you know.

LUNACHARSKY Dear An.
Vas.
, I have received your letter.
You had better write to my private address: 3.
Rue David Dufour.
I don’t know what to do about Kostrov’s pamphlet.
I have not yet read it in the press, but from the old man-uscript I know what kind of stuff it is.
You are quite right about its being plain “Black-Hundred literature”.
317 You ask—how to reply? Vas.
Vas.
has written a paragraph for Proletary—an uninteresting one, I don’t feel like publishing it.
Olin has delivered a lecture, he is writing, too, but I don’t think he’ll manage it.
Two things are required here, in my opinion: firstly, “a brief outline of the history of the split”.
A popu-lar one.
Starting from the beginning, from Economism.
Properly documented.
Divided into periods: 1901-03; 1903 (Second Congress); August 26, 1903-November 26, 1903; November 26, 1903-January 1904; January-August 1904; August 1904-May 1905; May 1905 (Third Congress).
I think it could be written so clearly, exactly, and con-cisely that even those to whom Kostrov addresses himself would read it.
Secondly, we need a lively, sharp, subtle and detailed characterisation (literary-critical) of these Black Hun-dreds.
As a matter of fact, this falsity is at the bottom of things both with L.
M.
(did you read the disgraceful stuff in No.
107? Schwarz is replying with an article.
I don’t know whether it is worth while?) and with Old Believer.
A number of such articles and pamphlets should be collected, the gross lie should be shown up, nailed down, so that it would be impossible to wriggle out of it, and branded as definitely “Black-Hundred literature”.
The new-Iskrists have now provided plenty of material and if it is carefully gone over and these dirty methods of tittle-tattle, talebear-ing, etc.
, are exposed in all their beauty, a powerful effectcould be produced.
L.
M.
’s obscure “personal hints” alone—what undiluted filth it is! I may perhaps tackle the first subject myself, but not just now, not soon; I have no time for it * (afterwards, I daresay, it will be too late!).
I would not tackle the second subject and I think that only you could do it.
A nasty job, a stinking one, there’s no denying it, but, after all, we are not fine gentlemen, but newspapermen, and it is impermissible for Social-Democratic publicists to allow “foulness and poison” to go unbranded.
Think this over and drop me a line.
A pamphlet on the mass political strike has to be pro-duced—that should not be difficult for you.
You should certainly continue writing popular pamphlets as well, selecting something topical.
What precisely, I do not know.
Perhaps about the Bulygin Duma? It will be necessary to await the publication.
320 It would be good to write about workers’ organisation.
Compare our Rules (Third Congress) and the Conference Statute, analyse the two, explain the idea, importance and methods of revolutionary organisation of the proletariat (particularly for an uprising), the difference between Party organisations and those aligned with the Party, etc.
In part, this would be an answer to Kostrov, a popular one, for the masses, on a burning topic of the day.
Have a try! All the very best, Yours, N.
Lenin Written between August 1 5 and 1 9 , 1905 Sent from Geneva to Italy First published in 1 9 3 4 Printed from the original * I am now going to answer Plekhanov (Sotsial-Demokrat No.
2).
318 He has to be pulled to pieces thoroughly, for he, too, has a heap of abominations and miserable arguments.
I hope that I shall succeed.
Further, I am turning over in my mind a plan for a popular pam-phlet: The Working Class and Revolution 319 —a description of demo-cratic and socialist tasks, and then conclusions about an uprising and a provisional revolutionary government, etc.
I think such a pamphlet is essential.

organisation abroad Decision of the C.
C.
representative abroad, which must be read out in full at the next meeting of the group (i.
e.
, today, August 29, if this decision arrives during the meeting).
322 Today, August 29, 1905, at 8 p.
m.
, copies of the letter from the Geneva group to the forwarding office and of the reply of the latter to the former reached the C.
C.
repre-sentative abroad.
In connection with these documents, the representative abroad of the C.
C.
of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
points out to the Geneva group that it has displayed lack of understanding of Party discipline and has violated the Party Rules.
The forwarders are agents of the Central Committee.
Any dissatisfaction with C.
C.
agents is a matter for examination primarily by the Central Committee itself.
According to the Rules, the C.
C.
deals with all conflicts arising within the Party, and particularly so in the case of conflicts between members of the Party’s various organisations and C.
C.
agents.
Therefore, by inviting C.
C.
agents to a meeting of the group, the latter took a step that was, formally speaking, incorrect in general and tactless in particular.
If, however, this invitation was not supposed to be a formal act, then it should not have been made in writing and officially.
The “personal behaviour” of “officers” is either merely personal (unconnected with and independent of the office they hold), in which case its investigation by the group amounts to squabbling; or else, the personal behaviourhas to do with the office, in which case every Party member, who is dissatisfied with this behaviour, and who insists on a formal, official investigation, is obliged first and fore-most to address himself formally to the C.
C.
The Geneva group of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, by allowing questions concerning dissatisfaction with C.
C.
agents to “come up” before the group as a matter of formal examination prior to this being formally reported to the C.
C.
, has thereby again showed failure to understand the discipline and Rules of the Party.
The difference I have just mentioned between squabbling and criticism of an officer (criticism which is obligatory for every Party member, and which should be made in an open way and addressed directly to the central institutions or the Congress, and not underhand, private, parochial criticism), this difference is evidently not clearly grasped by the group.
The C.
C.
representative abroad therefore considers it his duty to warn all young comrades of the group.
In the “colonial” conditions of life abroad people can always be found who are liable to contract the disease of squabbling, gossip and tittle-tattle, people who very badly fulfil the functions which the C.
C.
or the Congress entrusts to them, but who are eager to gossip about the unsatisfactory fulfil-ment of other functions by other Party members.
Some comrades, through inexperience, curiosity or spinelessness, may often listen seriously to these people.
Such people, however, should not be listened to, but should be sharply called to order and not allowed to raise formal questions concerning the “personal behaviour of officers” until these questions have been formally submitted for consideration to the appropriate Party institutions and examined and decided by them.
Party members abroad easily succumb to the disease I have indicated, but all young comrades with healthy nerves should keep a strict eye on themselves and others, for the only way of combating this disease is to see to it that any inclination towards squabbling and tittle-tattle is imme-diately and relentlessly nipped in the bud.
That is why the C.
C.
representative abroad has decided: I.
To request the Geneva group to withdraw its letter of August 28 to the forwarding office.
This would be the best and speediest way of ending a bad business which, by the very force of events, threatens to lead to the most unpleasant quarrels and rifts.
The group is not obliged, of course, to meet the request which I am making in the name of the C.
C.
I venture to make this request because I am dealing with comrades, with whom so far I have never had any formal conflict.
II.
Should the group reject my request then point I of the decision falls away.
In that case, I propose that the group: 1) Inform me whether it intends to comply with the Party Rules as explained above, i.
e.
, to comply with the decision made by me in the name of the C.
C.
(an appeal against this decision can be made (a) at a full meeting of the C.
C.
or (b) at a Congress, but it is binding until an-nulled by a higher body).
2) Send me, in accordance with Clause 11 of the Party Rules, all information concerning the make-up of the group and “all its activities” (votings, etc.
) in connection with the present unfortunate business.

I am explaining the passage he indicated in my decision (that people can be found who do their work badly, but who are eager to gossip about the shortcomings of others).
The suggestion that I meant to accuse someone, etc.
, is without grounds.
Every Party worker has his shortcomings and drawbacks in the work, but we must be careful that criticism of short-comings or their examination at the central Party bodies does not overstep the boundary where tittle-tattle begins.
The whole point and substance of my decision are meant to serve as a warning and a request that an immediate stop be put to a matter that has been wrongly and badly begun.

LUNACHARSKY Dear An.
Vas.
, Your plan for a pamphlet on Three Revolutions pleased me immensely.
I’d drop the reply to Plekhanov for the time being if I were you—let that enraged doctrinaire bark away to his heart’s content.
To delve specially into philosophy at such a time! You must work as hard as you can for Social-Democracy—don’t forget that you are com-mitted for your entire working time.
As for the Three Revolutions, tackle this straight away.
This subject has to be dealt with in a thorough manner.
I am sure you could make a success of it.
Describe, in a popular way, the tasks of socialism, its essence and the conditions for its realisation.
Then—victory in the present revolution, the significance of the peasant movement (a separate chapter), what could now be regarded as complete victory; a provisional government, revolutionary army, uprising—the significance and conditions of new forms of struggle.
Revolution à la 1789 and à la 1848.
Finally (better to make this the second part and the preceding one—the third), about the bourgeois character of the revolution, more fully about the economic aspect, then thoroughly expose the Osvobozhdeniye people in all their interests, tactics and po-litical intrigue.
This is a rich theme indeed, and a militant one, against the Iskra vulgarisers.
Please tackle it at once and take your time over it.
It is extremely important to produce a popular thing on this subject, something forceful and pointed.
Now about the split.
You misunderstood me.
It’s no use your waiting for me, for these are different subjects: one isthe history (we shall try to manage that); the other—an outline of their polemical methods.
A literary-critical out-line on the subject, let us say, of “cheap and shoddy litera-ture”.
Here an analysis is to be given in a whole pamphlet of several chapters, with quotations, showing up all this disgusting claptrap of Old Believer, Martov and the rest in their polemic with Proletary, as well as the rehash of this theme in “Majority or Minority”, etc.
Pillory them for their paltry method of warfare.
Make them into a type.
Draw a full-length portrait of them by quotations from their own writings! I am sure you’d pull it off, if only you collect a few quotations.
All the very best.

From Lenin to Members of the C.
C.
September 7, 1905 Dear friends, Today I received news of your agreement to a conference on the Duma with the Bund, the Letts, etc.
323 Only today, although the thing happened a month ago! It is left for me to write you another “protest” (an occupation which, it seems, is becoming my profession).
.
.
.
Definitely, I shall accuse you formally before the Fourth Congress of the crime called “restoration of duocentrism in defiance of the Rules and will of the Party”.
Really, I shall.
Just think—is it not duocentrism that you have introduced! I am obliged ex officio to run the organ of the Central Committee.
Is that not so? But how can I do that when I do not get a scrap of writing on any question of tactics, and a for-r-r-rmal enquiry about the “pre-arranged” meeting on September 1 (new style) is left without reply! Just think what the outcome will be if there is disharmony between us! Is it so difficult to get someone to write in good time, if only on matters of “state importance”? I have written about the Duma in Nos.
12, 14 and 15 of Proletary.
I am also writing in No.
16, which will come out on September 12 (new style) * .
In Posledniye Izvestia (Sep-tember 1, new style, No.
247) the Bund talked itself pop-eyed.
We’ll give them a whipping they won’t forget till * See “The Boycott of the Bulygin Duma, and Insurrection”, “‘Oneness of the Tsar and the People, and of the People and the Tsar’”, “In the Wake of the Monarchist Bourgeoisie, or in the Van of the Revolutionary Proletariat and Peasantry?” and “The Theory of Spon-taneous Generation” (present edition, Vol.
9).
—Ed.
they’re able to sit up again.
These Bundists are such dolts and trumpeters, such nitwits and idiots, they are the limit! Iskra has got tangled up in lies, especially Martov in the Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung (August 24, new style—transla-tion in Proletary No.
15).
For heaven’s sake, don’t rush in with an official resolution and do not give way an inch to this Bundist-new-Iskrist conference.
Is it true that there will be no minutes? How can one possibly confer with these prostitutes without minutes? I strongly warn you against the Armenian Social-Demo-cratic Federation.
324 If you have agreed to its participation in the conference, you have made a fatal mistake, which must be rectified at all costs.
It is represented in Geneva by a couple of disrupters who publish sheer trivia here and have no serious connections with the Caucasus.
It is a Bund creatura, nothing more, specially invented to cultivate Caucasian Bundism.
If you allow these people to attend a Russian conference, that is, a conference of organisations working in Russia, you will get yourself into a terrible mess.
All the Caucasian comrades are against this gang of disruptive writers (I know this from many people); and we shall soon trounce them in Proletary.
You will only evoke protests from the Caucasus and a fresh squabble instead of “peace” and “unity”.
For pity’s sake! How can one ignore the Caucasian Union, which is working so hard in Russia, and hobnob with the dregs of the Geneva marsh! I beg you most earnestly, don’t do it.
I have received the decision about dividing the money equally with the Organisation Committee.
It will be carried out to the letter.

KRASIKOV September 14, 1905 Dear friend, I hasten to reply to your pessimistic letter.
I cannot verify the facts, but it seems to me that you are exaggerat-ing; that’s the first point.
The C.
C.
’s leaflets are good, and Rabochy No.
1 is very good.
325 This is a big thing.
At the moment financial affairs are bad, but connections exist and the prospects are very good.
One big enterprise, very solid and profitable, has been set up, so the “finan-cier” 326 is certainly not asleep.
The second point: you take a wrong view of things.
To wait until there is complete solidarity within the C.
C.
or among its agents is utopian.
“Not a circle, but a party”, dear friend! Focus attention on the local committees; they are autonomous, they give full scope, they free one’s hands for financial and other connections, for statements in the press, and so on and so forth.
Mind you don’t make the same mistake you are blaming others for; don’t moan and groan, and if you don’t like working as an agent, push on with committee work and urge those who think like you to do the same.
Assuming that you do have differences of opinion with the “agents”.
It is far more advisable for you to get your views accepted in the committee, especially if it is a united, principled committee, and to conduct an open, straightforward, vigorous policy in it than to argue with the “agents”.
If you are right about the anaemia of the committees and a plethora of “agents”, the remedy for this malady is in your own hands: flock into the committees.
The committee is autono-mous.
The committees decide everything at congresses.
The committees can pass resolutions.
The committees have theright to go into print.
Don’t sit idle, looking up at the “heads”, but get down to business on your own.
You now have a broad, free field and independent, rewarding work in a most important committee.
Throw yourself into it, pick a willing team, approach the workers boldly and widely, run off leaflets, order them from us, Schwarz, me, Galyorka, loudly voice your Party opinion in the name of the committee.
In this way, I assure you, you will do a thousand times more to influence the whole Party and the C.
C.
in the direction you desire than by bringing personal influence to bear on the agents and members of the C.
C.
It strikes me that you are looking at things in the old paro-chial way, and not from the Party standpoint.
The C.
C.
is elective, the congress is not far off, you have your rights, make use of them and bring all energetic, resolute sup-porters on to the same road: into the committees! Pressure must be brought to bear formally, through the committees, and not personally through talks with the agents.
No one is obliged to be an agent if he wants to work in the com-mittees! You write that the agent Myamlin stated that Iskra’s Khlestakovian report is fair.
327 Very well.
That is his right.
But in Letuchy Listok No.
1, the C.
C.
stated that two-thirds of the Party is on our side.
That means that Myamlin has hit out at himself! Your job is to curb the Myamlins and expose and discredit them through your own committee, and not through talks with them.
The committees will elect people who appoint the Myamlins, but it is not the Myam-lins who decide the fate of the Party.
Let energetic people capture the committees: there you have a slogan for all, which I advise you to spread, to drum into people’s heads and to implement.
The agent Myamlin stands for two central organs.
Again: who will decide? The committees and their delegates to the fourth congress.
Prepare one, two or more committees— there you have a rewarding and practical task.
Suppose the Myamlins are victorious.
The committees have the right to start their own organ of the press, even a single committee! That is why you err and drift into the old, pre-party point of view when you write: “They are printing Trotsky’s leaf-lets” (there is nothing wrong in that if the leaflets are fairlygood and vetted.
I advise the St.
Petersburg Committee, too, to print his leaflets vetted, say, by you), or when you write: “A fall from grace à la Boris is imminent.
” I don’t understand it.
Suppose there are Borises.
This junk is al-ways plentiful.
Suppose the Borises and Myamlins prove to have the majority (of the committees, don’t forget that, of the committees).
Then “all the preceding work is undone”, you conclude.
Why? How can Proletary become undone, what can cause its undoing? Even the absurdity of “two central organs” will not cause the undoing of Proletary, it will only introduce absurdity into the Rules.
Life will only preserve Proletary and sweep away the absurdity.
Even the Myamlins will not dare to close down Proletary.
And finally, let us assume the worst of possible endings, in the vein of your pessimism: suppose the closing down does take place.
I shall then ask: what is the St.
Petersburg Commit-tee for? Is it likely that Proletary will be weaker as the organ of the St.
Petersburg Committee than as one of “two” cen-tral organs? Take immediate energetic measures to have the St.
Petersburg Committee establish not formal, but busi-ness-like, close, permanent ties with Proletary, and you will strengthen your position and the impact of your ideas so much that you will defy a hundred Myamlins.
The St.
Petersburg Committee is a force three times as great as all the “agents” put together.
Make Proletary the organ of the St.
Petersburg Committee and the St.
Petersburg Committee the thorough-going executor of the ideas and tactics of Proletary; there you have a real struggle against Myamlinism, and not a struggle by complaints and groan-ing.
Hundreds of addresses can be found in St.
Petersburg, and a host of opportunities for organising workers’ corre-spondence, revitalising contacts, placing orders for leaflets, republishing articles from Proletary in leaflet form, retell-ing them in leaflets, re-writing them in the form of leaflets, etc.
, etc.
Leaflets can and should deal also with general Party problems (the other day the Kostroma Committee sent us a resolution against Plekhanov being appointed to the International Bureau: a downright smack in the eye, and no mistake!).
Myamlinism must be combated by exem-plary organisation of committee agitation, by militant leaflets to the Party and not by wry complaints to the C.
C.
!What article of mine in No.
5 (?) of Zarya (on Proko-povich) are you referring to? 328 I am puzzled.
Why are you dissatisfied with Ruben? Put me in direct touch with him and Lalayants without fail.
All the very best.
Write oftener and cheer up! The Myam-lins be damned! Yours, N.

GUSEV To Nation from Lenin September 20, 1905 Dear friend, Thanks for letter No.
3.
We may publish part of it.
329 You have made a start with the talks with the editorial board not merely on formal questions (on the Rules, con-tacts, addresses, and so on), not only on subjects for report-age (such and such events occurred), but on the subject of the gist of your views, your understanding of our tactics, and how precisely you put these tactics into effect in lec-tures, at meetings, etc.
Such talks between practical workers in Russia and ourselves are extremely valuable to us, and I request you most earnestly to advocate, remind and in-sist everywhere that anyone who wants to consider the Cen-tral Organ his own C.
O.
(and every Party member should want that), should not restrict himself to formal answers or reports, but should talk with the editorial board about the views he is advocating, talk not for publication, but to create an ideological connection.
To regard such talks as a mere pastime is to lapse into narrow-minded practical-ism and leave to chance the entire principled, ideological aspect of all our practical work, all agitation, for without a clear, well-thought-out ideological content agitation de-generates into phrase-mongering.
And to work out a clear ideological content it is not enough to be merely a contrib-utor to the C.
O.
, it requires also joint discussions about how the practical workers understand one or other proposi-tion, how they are putting into actual practice particular views.
Without this, the editorial board of the C.
O.
is left in the air, it will not know whether its advocacy is accepted, whether there is any response to it, how practical life modifies it, what amendments and additions are needed.
Without it, Social-Democrats will sink to a level where the writer scribbles and the reader reads from time to time.
Consciousness of connection with the Party is still weak among us, it has to be strengthened by word and deed.
I shall try to make use of your example by publishing part of your letter.
On the whole we are in agreement and see eye to eye with you (your ideas coincide with mine in Two Tactics).
In particular, it seems to me that you are wrong in attacking the Mensheviks for the words “prepara-tion of the masses for an uprising”.
If there is a mistake here, it is not a cardinal one.
All the very best.

2 for June 24, 1905, only today, October 3, 1905, new style.
(It takes the “United Centre” three months to inform its members.
.
.
.
) The article: “Fundamentals of Party Organisation” is very good.
I can imagine what it’s like to have to chew over the ABC to the Mensheviks! But you have to.
The writer of the article has made an excellent job of it.
I am thinking of publishing it in Proletary.
330 It is late, of course, but better late than never.
This article has set me thinking that you can and should see to it that the C.
C.
is not mute but always articulate.
The time is past for ideological leadership through “whisper-ings” in secret meeting places and rendezvous with agents! Leadership should be through political literature.
Rabochy is not suitable for that, it has a different role to perform.
You must decidedly issue a C.
C.
bulletin in a format not exceeding two printed pages, but you should issue it twice a week.
It would contain a short article on a political, tactical or organisational subject, then brief, minor items of three lines each.
Only (1) it must be printed, for the hectograph is now very bad (is there not some small equip-ment that operates rapidly?) and (2) it must be done punc-tually and frequently.
Your plan of converting Rabochy into a smaller weekly newspaper is not clear to me.
In my opinion, a popular organ is one thing (I am not in favour of it, but the Congress decided on it, so that’s that), and a bulletin of really guiding political articles of a general kind is another.
You have three or four good contributors, so it would be as easy as anything to get two small articles every week, and the significance would be tremendous!

October 3, 1905 Dear friends, I have received a pile of documents and listened to Delta’s detailed story.
I hasten to reply on all the points.
1) I shall not be able to come at the scheduled time, as there can be no question of my leaving the newspaper now.
331 Voinov is stuck in Italy.
Orlovsky had to be sent away on business.
There is no one to replace me.
Therefore the thing is being postponed until Russian October, as arranged by you.
2) I repeat my most urgent request that you send a formal reply to the International Bureau.
As to whether you are sending someone to the conference abroad.
Exactly whom and when.
As to whether you are appointing some-one—also precisely.
Otherwise you will discredit yourselves incredibly in the eyes of the International Bureau.
3) About Plekhanov, also formally and conclusively— yes or no.
Who should be appointed? Postponement of this question is extremely dangerous.
332 4) About legal publishing, make a formal decision quickly.
My draft agreement with Malykh, 333 has done you no harm whatever, as it is only a draft.
I merely repeat that Malykh provided a livelihood for lots of people here, whom the Party is unable to maintain.
Do not forget that.
I would advise both concluding an agreement with Malykh and continuing to do business with the others after the manner of Schmidt.
5) As regards opposition to the C.
C.
on the part of almost all the agents, I have the following to say.
Firstly, co-opting Insarov and Lyubich, which I fully welcome, will probablyimprove matters very much.
Secondly, some of the agents are evidently exaggerating somewhat.
Thirdly, would it not be advisable to put some of the agents on the commit-tees with instructions to concern themselves with the whole area of two or three neighbouring committees? Unity of tactics should not be overestimated: a certain variety in the actions and plans of the committees will do no harm.
6) I consider it extremely important to start preparing for the fourth congress.
334 It is high time.
It will prob-ably be six months late at least, if not more.
All the same, it is high time.
I think we are a little to blame for the laxity among some of the committees and for allowing them to waive the decisions of the Third Congress concern-ing the conditions of admission for the Mensheviks.
If these committees, which at one and the same time recognise and do not recognise the Third Congress, do not define their attitude to the fourth congress, there will be chaos Some of them will not attend the fourth congress.
Another scandal.
Some of them will attend it and desert to the other side at the congress.
We should not confuse the policy of uniting the two parts with the mixing-up of both parts.
We agree to uniting the two parts, but we shall never agree to mixing them up.
We must demand of the committees a distinct division, then two congresses and amalgamation.
Two congresses at the same time, in one place, and they will discuss and accept the drafts for amalgamation pre-pared beforehand.
But just now we must vigorously oppose any mixing-up of the two sections of the Party.
I would advise giving the agents a watchword of this kind in the most definite form and instructing them to put it into effect.
If this is not done there will be an unholy mess.
The Mensheviks have everything to gain by confusion and they will go out of their way to breed it.
They won’t be “any the worse for it” (since nothing can be worse than their disorganisation), whereas we value our organisation, em-bryonic though it is, and will defend it tooth and nail.
It pays the Mensheviks to mix things up and make another scandal out of the fourth congress, for they are not even contemplating a congress of their own.
We must direct all our efforts and all our thoughts towards cementing andbetter organising our section of the Party.
These tactics may seem “egoistic”, but they are the only reasonable ones.
If we are well united and organised, if we get rid of all the whiners and turncoats, then our hard core, even if not very large, will carry with it the whole mass of “organ-isational nebulosity”.
But if we have no such core, the Mensheviks, having disorganised themselves, will disor-ganise us as well.
If we have a hard core, we shall soon force them into amalgamation with us.
If we have no core, then it will not be the other core (it is non-existent) that will win the day, but the muddleheads, and then, I assure you, there will be fresh squabbles, a fresh, inevitable split and resentment a hundred times worse than before.
So let us prepare for real unification by increasing our own strength and working out clear drafts for standards of rules and tactics.
And the people who chatter idly about unification, who mix up the relations between the sections of the Party, should, in my opinion, be ruthlessly removed from our midst.
All the best.

October 5, 1905 Dear friends, I have just received Reinert’s new letter.
I have gone carefully into his proposal, talked it over with Delta and revised my negative reply in the letter of October 3, 1905.
I can return Orlovsky in a week’s time.
They could then, perhaps, manage without me somehow for a week or two.
I would write a few articles in advance and do some writing during the journey.
But your plan, nevertheless, seems to me highly irrational.
According to the news now filling the foreign press, feeling in Finland is running very high.
It is openly reported that a number of outbreaks are immi-nent and that an uprising is being prepared.
Troops are being sent there in force.
The coastal and naval police have been reinforced fourfold.
After the John Grafton inci-dent, 335 special attention is being paid to ships approach-ing the coasts.
Arms have been discovered in many places and the search for them has been stepped up.
It is consid-ered within the bounds of possibility that clashes will be deliberately provoked to provide a pretext for using armed force.
To arrange a general meeting there under such circum-stances means taking a quite unnecessary risk.
It would be an absolutely desperate undertaking.
A trifling accident (the likelihood of which in Finland now is particularly great) would be enough to wreck everything, both the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
, for then everything here would go to pieces.
We must face the facts: it would mean handing over the Party wholly to the Menshevik leaders to be torn to pieces.
I am sure that when you have thought the matter over you will agree that we are not entitled to do that.
Please discuss whether the plan could not be altered in the following way.
All of us to meet in Stockholm.
Compared to the present plan this would mean for you some slight inconveniences and tremendous advantages.
The inconveniences lie in the half-a-day’s delay (counting from Abo, near which it is proposed to meet) or a maximum of one day each way.
Two days in all, possibly even 4 days.
That is a mere trifle.
The advantages are greater safety.
A total break-down would then be ruled out completely.
That means we shall not in the slightest jeopardise the C.
O.
and the whole C.
C.
; we shall not be doing anything stupid or desperate.
Some of you can travel quite legally; they cannot be arrested.
The rest will obtain passports of other people or will travel without passports (Delta says it is easy for the Finns to arrange for crossing the frontier).
In the event of an arrest being made, it would be, firstly, an isolated case and not wholesale break-down and, secondly, there would be absolutely no evidence, so that in the event of legal proceedings it would be impossible for the police to dig up anything serious.
We are then guaranteed meeting for two to three days in complete safety, with all the docu-ments available (I shall bring them with me and you will send yours by post, etc.
), and with the possibility of draw-ing up any minutes, manifestos, etc.
, that we like.
Finally, we would then try out whether I could travel to Stockholm more frequently, in order to work for you and for the leaflets, etc.
, from there (the Mensheviks, I believe, did something of the kind in the South).
Please discuss this plan carefully.
If you approve, send me a telegram addressed: Kroupsky, 3, Rue David Dufour, Genève, signed Boleslav with just a number indicating the date when I ought to be in Stockholm (30= I should be there by September 30; 2 or 3= I should be there by October 2 or 3, and so on).
All the best.

October 8, 1905 Dear friends, I hasten to inform you of an important change that has taken place in regard to representation on the Interna-tional Bureau.
The South-Russian Conference of Menshe-viks 336 adopted a resolution on this question in which (1) there is a gross lie about me personally.
I am replying in No.
20 of Proletary, * which will come out the day after tomorrow; (2) they ask Plekhanov to represent their section of the Party.
This is exactly what we need! Plekhanov, of course, will accede to their request.
His quasi-neutrality, which is so disastrous to us, will be shown up, and that is just what we wanted to prove.
Let there be two representatives on the International Bureau: one from the Majority and one from the Minority.
That will be the best thing.
Moreover, if Plekhanov represents the Minority that will be better still.
It is an excellent precedent for future unity.
I ear-nestly request you: abandon now all thought of Plekhanov and appoint your own delegate from the Majority.
Only then will our interests be fully taken care of.
It would be good to appoint Orlovsky.
He knows languages, he is a good speaker, and an impressive personality.
Most contacts are by writing, almost all of them, and we, of course, would begin consultations.
As a matter of fact, there would be nothing to consult about: I assure you from experience that this representation is a mere formality.

the InternationalPlekhanov often entrusted this representation to Koltsov, and no harm ever came of it, although Koltsov was no good at all as a “parliamentarian” and an impossible, clumsy lout in general.
All the best.

LUNACHARSKY October 11 Dear An.
Vas.
, Your article deals with a subject that is extremely inter-esting and very timely.
337 Recently, in a leading article, Leipziger Volkszeitung 338 ridiculed the Zemstvo members for their September Congress, for “playing at a Consti-tution”, for already posing as parliamentarians, etc.
, etc.
The mistake of Parvus and Martov needs analysing from this aspect.
But your article gives no analysis.
I believe the article should be revised along one of two lines: either the weight of emphasis should be shifted to our new-Isk-rists, who are “playing at parliamentarism”, and you should demonstrate in detail the relative, temporary im-portance of parliamentarism, the futility of “parliamentary illusions” in an era of revolutionary struggle, etc.
, by explaining the whole thing from the beginning (for Russians this is very useful!) and introducing a bit of Hilferding, 339 just by way of illustration; or else you should take Hilfer-ding as a basis—the article will then need less revision— give it a different heading, but describe more clearly Hil-ferding’s method of presenting the question.
Of course, you may find another plan of revision, but please set to work on it at once, without fail.
You have time for it, since the article could not go into this issue (the Moscow events340& the old material have taken up all the space).
So, the deadline is Tuesday, October 17.
Please make it a com-prehensive article and send it by October 17.
It would be better to revise it along the first lines, it may then turn out to be an editorial! If we already had a parliament, we would certainly support the Cadets, 341 Milyukov and Co.
contra Moskov-skiye Vedomosti.
For example, when balloting, etc.
Such action there would not in the slightest degree violate the independence of the class party of Social-Democracy.
But in an era not of parliament, but of revolution (you make the distinction in the very heading), support for people who are incapable of fighting in a revolutionary way is 1) violation of the independence of our Party.
The deal cannot be clear and above-board.
It is precisely the “sale” of our right to revolution, as you say, and not the use of our right for the purpose of support.
In a parliament we give support without in any way disappearing.
Now we are disappearing by obliging the Milyukovs to speak for us on definite terms.
Further, what is most important 2) such support is betrayal of the revolution.
There is no parliament as yet, it is only an illusion of the Milyukovs.
We must fight in a revolutionary way for a parliament, but not in a parliamentary way for a revolution; we must fight in a revolutionary way for a strong parliament, and not in an impotent “parliament” for a revolution.
In Russia now, without the victory of the revolution, all victories in “parliament” (the Duma or the like) are nothing, worse than nothing, for they blind the eyes by a fiction.
Parvus has not understood this.
The Cadets have already become regierungsfähig * (the Trubetskois and Manuilovs in the role of rectors, etc.
), they have already climbed to the second storey of freedom of assembly (at the price of debasing assemblies), the storey of quasi-parliamentarism.
All they need is that the prole-tariat, while remaining actually in the basement, should imagine itself on the second storey, should fancy itself a parliamentary force and agree to “conditions” about “support” and so on.
That is a rich theme! We now are strong owing to the revolutionary struggle of the people and weak in a quasi-parliamentary respect.
With the Cadets it is just the reverse.
They calculate on dragging us into quasi-parliamentarism.
Iskra has allowed itself to be fooled.
It is on this point that a detailed analysis of the relation of “‘parliamentarism’ to revolution” would be appropriate (cf.
Marx on the class struggles in France in 1848).
342 * Fit to govern.
—Ed.
These ideas outlined by you (I am stating them, of course, in a very general and inexact way) must be amplified, mulled over, and served up.
People in Russia are now badly in need of having the relation between parliamentarism and revolution explained to them from the very beginning.
But Martov and Co.
go into hysterics and scream: if only we would become legal! If only we would act openly! It doesn’t matter how, so long as it’s legal! It is now of all times that we need steadfastness, the continuation of the revolution, struggle against a wretched semi-legality.
Iskra has failed to understand this.
Like all opportunists, they do not believe in the energy and stubbornness of the workers’ revolutionary struggle.
Moscow is a lesson to them.
And here we have that vulgarian Parvus applying to Russia the tactics of petty deals! Did you receive my letter? All the very best to you and to An.

GUSEV To Nation from Lenin October 13, 1905 Dear friend, The resolution of the Odessa Committee on the trade union struggle (“decisions” No.
6 or 5—it is not clear; in letter No.
24.
It is dated September 1905) seems to me highly erroneous.
The excitement of the struggle against the Mensheviks naturally explains this, but one must not fall into the other extreme.
And that is just what this resolution does.
I venture, therefore, to make a critical analysis of the Odessa Committee’s resolution, and would ask the comrades to discuss my remarks, which are in no way due to a desire to find fault.
The resolution is in three (unnumbered) parts in the preamble, and five (numbered) parts in the resolution proper.
The first part (the opening paragraph of the preamble) is quite good: to undertake “leadership of all manifesta-tions of the class struggle of the proletariat” and “never to forget the task” of leading the trade union struggle.
Splendid.
Further, the second point, that the task of pre-paring for an armed uprising comes “into the forefront”, and (the third or final point of the preamble) “in conse-quence of this the task of leading the trade union struggle of the proletariat inevitably recedes into the background”.
This, in my opinion, is wrong theoretically and incorrect from the point of view of tactics.
It is wrong theoretically to equate the two tasks as if they were on the same level: “the task of preparing for an armed uprising” and “the task of leading the trade union struggle ” .
The one task is said to be in the forefront, theother in the background.
To speak like that means com-paring and contrasting things of a different order.
The armed uprising is a method of political struggle at a given moment.
The trade union struggle is one of the constant forms of the whole workers’ movement, one always needed under capitalism and essential at all times.
In a passage quoted by me in What Is To Be Done? 343 Engels distin-guishes three basic forms of the proletarian struggle: econom-ic, political, and theoretical—that is to say, trade union, political, and theoretical (scientific, ideological, and philosophical).
How can one of these basic forms of struggle (the trade union form) be put on a level with a method of another basic form of struggle at a given moment? How can the whole trade union struggle, as a “task”, be put on a level with the present and by far not the only method of political struggle? These are incommensurable things, something like adding tenths to hundredths without reduc-ing them to a common denominator.
In my opinion, both these points (the second and third) of the preamble should be deleted.
Alongside “the task of leading the trade union struggle” can be put only the task of leading the general political struggle as a whole, the task of waging the general ideological struggle as a whole, and not some particular, given, modern tasks of the political or ideological struggle.
In place of these two points mention should be made of the necessity of never for a moment forgetting the political struggle, the education of the working class in all the fullness of Social-Democratic ideas, and the need to achieve a close, indissoluble connection between all manifesta-tions of the workers’ movement for creating an integral, truly Social-Democratic movement.
This indication could be the second point of the preamble.
The third could mention the necessity of warning against the narrow conception and narrow formulation of the trade union struggle, which are zealously disseminated by the bourgeoisie.
I am not, of course, putting forward a draft for the resolution, I am not touching on the question whether it is worth while making special mention of this; for the time being I am merely examining what expression of your thought would be theo-retically correct.
Tactically, the resolution in its present form puts the casefor an armed uprising rather lamely.
An armed uprising is the highest method of political struggle.
Its success from the point of view of the proletariat, i.
e.
, the success of a proletarian uprising under Social-Democratic leader-ship, and not of any other kind of uprising, requires exten-sive development of all aspects of the workers’ movement.
Hence the idea of contraposing the task of an uprising to the task of leading the trade union struggle is supremely incorrect.
In this way the task of the uprising is played down, belittled.
Instead of summing up and crowning the entire workers’ movement as a whole, the result is that the task of the uprising is dealt with as a thing apart.
Two things are, as it were, mixed up: a resolution on the trade union struggle in general (this is the subject of the Odessa Committee’s resolution), and a resolution on the disposi-tion of forces in the present work of the Odessa Committee (your resolution goes off on this tack, but that’s quite another pair of shoes).
I pass on to the numbered points of the part comprising the resolution proper.
Ad I.
“To expose the illusions” “which are bound up with the trade unions” .
.
.
this is more or less passable, although it were best deleted.
Firstly, it belongs to the preamble, where the inseparable connection of all aspects of the movement should be pointed out.
Secondly, the nature of the illusions is not stated.
If this is to be inserted at all, there should be added: bourgeois illusions as to the possibility of meeting the economic and other needs of the working class in capitalist society.
.
.
.
“strongly emphasising their [the unions’s] narrowness compared with the ultimate aims of the workers’ move-ment”.
It follows that all trade unions are “narrow”.
What about Social-Democratic trade unions which are linked with the political organisation of the proletariat? The crux of the matter is not that trade unions are “narrow”, but that this one aspect (and narrow just because it is one aspect) should be bound up with others.
Consequently, these words should either be thrown out or further mention should be made of the need to establish and strengthen the connection between one aspect and all the others, the need to imbue the trade unions with Social-Democraticcontent, Social-Democratic propaganda, and to draw them into all Social-Democratic work, etc.
Ad II.
All right.
Ad III.
For the reasons stated, it is incorrect to compare the task of the trade unions with the “most urgent and primary task” of an armed uprising.
There is no need to speak of the armed uprising in a resolution on the trade union struggle, for the former is a means for the “over-throw of the tsarist autocracy” which is mentioned in point II.
The trade unions could broaden the basis from which we shall draw strength for an uprising, so that, I say once again, it is erroneous to contrapose one to the other.
Ad IV.
“To wage a vigorous ideological struggle against the so-called Minority”, which is reverting to “Economism” “in problems of the trade unions”.
Isn’t this too general for a resolution of the Odessa Committee? Doesn’t it seem an exaggeration? After all, there has been no criticism in the press of any resolution of the Mensheviks on the “trade unions”.
It has merely been pointed out that the liberals praise them for a tendency to fall over backwards in their zeal on this question.
The only [inference] to be drawn from this is that we too must show zeal, without however “fall-ing over backwards” in the attempt.
I think this point should either be deleted altogether, leaving only a warning against narrowness and mentioning the struggle against the tendencies of the bourgeoisie and liberals to distort the tasks of the trade unions, or it should be formulated specially in connection with some particular resolution of the Mensheviks (I do not know of such resolutions at the present time, unless some kind of Akim resolutions appeared among you in the South).
Ad V.
Now this is the real thing.
The words “and, if possible, leadership” I would replace by “and leadership”.
We do everything “if possible”.
The insertion of these words here of all places may be misinterpreted in the sense that we strive less for leadership, etc.
Generally speaking I think we should be careful not to exaggerate the struggle against the Mensheviks on this issue.
This is probably just the time when trade unions will soon begin to spring up.
We must not stand aloof, and above all not give any occasion for thinking that weought to stand aloof, but endeavour to take part, to in-fluence, etc.
For there is a special section of workers, elderly family men, who will make very little contribution to the political struggle at present, but very much to the trade union struggle.
We must make use of this section, merely guiding their steps in this field.
It is important that at the very outset Russian Social-Democrats should strike the right note in regard to the trade unions, and at once create a tradition of Social-Democratic initiative in this matter, of Social-Democratic participation, of Social-Democratic leadership.
In practice, of course, there may not be enough forces, but that is quite another question; even so, given an ability to make use of all the available forces, some will always be found for the trade unions as well.
Forces have been found for writing a resolution on the trade unions, i.
e.
, for ideological guidance, and that’s the crux of the matter! I wish you all the best and ask you to drop me a line about receipt of this letter and about your thoughts in con-nection with it.
Yours, N.
Lenin Sent from Geneva to Odessa First published in 1 9 2 6 Printed from the original158 TO MARIA ESSEN October 26, 1905 Dear Beastie, I received your long letter a few days ago.
Many thanks We get very little news from St.
Petersburg, and few leaflets of any kind.
Please do not abandon your intention to send us absolutely all news of every kind as well as correspondence.
As regards Party affairs, it seems to me that your pessi-mism is a bit exaggerated.
I judge by things over here.
I continually hear from the “periphery” that Proletary is obviously on the decline, that things are going from bad to worse, that the newspaper is running to seed and so on and so forth.
But things are not as bad as they seem.
With the gigantic movement that there is now, no single C.
C.
in the world, under conditions where the Party is illegal could satisfy a thousandth part of the demands made on it.
That our slogans, the slogans of Proletary, are not just a voice crying in the wilderness, can be clearly seen even from the legal newspapers, which report meetings of 10,000-15,000 in the University, etc.
My word, our revolution in Russia is a fine one! We hope to return there soon—things are heading that way with remarkable speed.
We shall certainly arrange a meeting with the C.
C.
This question is already settled and everything has been arranged.
As regards differences of opinion, you seem to be exagger-ating too.
I see no disagreements here between Proletary and the C.
C.
Timing the uprising? Who would undertake to fix it? Personally, I would willingly postpone it until the spring, and until the Manchurian army comes home; I am inclined to think that in general it will be to our advantage to postpone it.
But, then, nobody asks us, any-way.
Take the present tremendous strike.
That the C.
C.
is focussing its attention on leadership through the press is, in my opinion, the right tactics.
I only wish that in addition to Rabochy, which is very useful at the present time, we had agitational bulletins, small ones of two, or a maximum of four, pages, lively, frequent, issued at least once a week, and sometimes twice.
With the present gigantic, incredible growth of the movement, the Party can be led only through the press.
And we must produce lively, mobile, speedy, brief leaflet-bulletins, giving the main slogans and the results of the main events.
Concerning stoppage of the Central Organ, there is a misunderstanding here.
They were afraid of the whole busi-ness going bankrupt, but had no intention of suppressing the C.
O.
Generally speaking the importance of the foreign-based section of the Party is now diminishing hour by hour, and this is unavoidable.
We shall not abandon Proletary, of course, under any circumstances, until we can get it published in Nevsky Prospekt in St.
Petersburg.
But we must now pay a great deal of attention to a legal newspaper as well.
We here abroad already have to put the shutters up (propagandist literature), and we shall soon close down altogether and open up in St.
Petersburg.
In preparing for the uprising, I would advise at once carrying out extensive propaganda everywhere for the organisation of a large number, hundreds and thousands, of autonomous combat squads, very small ones (from three persons upwards), which would arm themselves as best they can and prepare themselves in every way.
The time of the uprising, I repeat, I would willingly postpone until the spring, but it is difficult, of course, for me to judge from a distance.
All the very best.
Yours, N.

V.
PLEKHANOV Dear Georgi Valentinovich, I am writing this letter to you because I am convinced that the need for Social-Democratic unity is a question that can no longer be put off, and the possibility for it is now greater than ever.
Two reasons prevent me from further postponing a direct approach to you: 1) the founding of a legal Social-Democratic newspaper, Novaya Zhizn, in St.
Petersburg, and 2) the events of the last few days.
345 Even if these events do not lead to our returning to Russia very soon, at any rate this return is now very, very near, and the Social-Democratic newspaper provides an imme-diate basis for the most serious joint work.
That we Bolsheviks earnestly desire to work together with you is something I need hardly repeat to you.
I have written to St.
Petersburg asking all the editors of the new newspaper (at present there are seven of them: Bogdanov, Rumyantsev, Bazarov, Lunacharsky, Orlovsky, Olminsky and myself) to send you a joint and official request to join the editorial board.
But events will not wait, postal com-munication is interrupted, and I do not think I am justi-fied in postponing an essential step for what is really a mere formality.
In fact, I am absolutely sure of general agreement and joy on account of this proposal.
I am very well aware that all Bolsheviks have always regarded disagreement with you as something temporary, due to exceptional circum-stances.
It goes without saying, the struggle often involved us in steps, statements and actions which were bound to make future unity more difficult, but there has always been a readiness on our part to unite, a consciousness of he extreme abnormality of the best force among RussianSocial-Democrats standing aloof from the work, a conscious-ness of the entire movement’s extreme need of your guiding, close and immediate participation.
And we all firmly believe that if not today, then tomorrow, and if not tomor-row, then the day after, our union with you will come about despite all difficulties and obstacles.
But it would be better if it were today rather than tomor-row.
Things have now taken such a turn that we may be too late, and we intend to exert every effort not to be late.
Would you care to work together with us? I should be extremely glad if you would agree to meet me and talk this over.
I am confident that a personal meeting would remove many misunderstandings, and many seeming diffi-culties in the way of unity would vanish at once.
But should you not agree in general, or not agree just now, I venture to take the liberty of touching on some of these difficulties in advance.
These difficulties are: 1) Your disagreements with many members of the new editorial board.
2) Your disinclination to join either of the two halves of the Social-Democratic Party.
—The first difficulty, I think, is wholly removable.
We are in agreement with you on approximately nine-tenths of the questions of theory and tactics, and to quarrel over one-tenth is not worth while.
You wanted, and still want, to correct some assertions, which you regard as erro-neous, in my writings.
But nowhere at any time have I gone out of my way specially to impose my views on any Social-Democrat, and none, positively none, of the new editors has entered into an engagement to be “Leninist”.
Barsov’s speech at the Third Congress was an expression of the general view in this respect.
You consider that the philosophical views of three of the seven persons mentioned are erro-neous.
346 But these three, too, have not attempted, and are not attempting, to link these views of theirs with any official Party matter.
And these three—I am not speaking at random but on the basis of precise knowledge of the facts—would be extremely glad to work jointly with you.
For you and us to part company politically now, at a time when your general sympathy with the views of the Majority is known, among other things, from your lecture, is evi-dent from your latest writings, and is evident indirectly from the position adopted by Parvus, who is perhaps most in agreement with you—to part company politically now would be extremely undesirable, extremely inoppor-tune, and extremely harmful for the Social-Democratic movement.
And a new legal newspaper, which will have an audience of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of workers—indeed, all the coming work in Russia at a time when your immense knowledge and vast political experience are terribly needed by the Russian proletariat—all this will provide new ground, on which it will be so much easier to forget the past and work together on a real live job.
To pass from work in Geneva to work in St.
Petersburg is a transition that is exceptionally favourable, psychologically and from the Party standpoint, for going over from disunity to unity, and I very much hope that we shall not miss such an oppor-tunity, which has not occurred since the Second Congress and which, probably, will not occur again so soon.
Here, however, is the second difficulty.
Perhaps you do not want unity with one half of the Party.
You will demand unity of the whole Party as a conditio sine qua non for your participation in the work.
You are quite right in holding that such unity is desirable and necessary.
But is it possible at present? You yourself are inclined to answer this in the negative, for not long ago you were proposing a federa-tion.
Today the broadest tribune for our influence on the proletariat is a daily newspaper in St.
Petersburg (we shall be in a position to issue it in an edition of 100,000 copies and bring the price down to one kopek).
Is a joint editorial board with the Mensheviks conceivable at present? We think it is not.
And so do the Mensheviks.
And so do you, judging from your proposal for a federation.
Are three newspapers really necessary? Cannot we get together for a political organ of revolutionary Social-Democracy when there are really no organisational disagreements between us, and the Party’s coming out into the open tomorrow will dispel all lingering fears about conspiracy.
And the revolution itself will sweep away our tactical differences with astonishing speed; besides, you have not expressed any disagreement with the resolutions of the Third Congress;and these resolutions, after all, are the sole Party directive that unites all of us Bolsheviks.
It seems to me that under such circumstances your com-ing over to us is fully possible, and it will not make future unity more difficult, but will rather facilitate and accel-erate it.
Instead of the present struggle, which is being protracted owing to your standing aloof, the revolutionary Social-Democratic movement as a whole will be in a strong-er position.
The struggle, too, will gain by it by becoming steadier, more disciplined.
The general body of Social-Democrats will at once feel confident, hopeful—a different atmosphere will immediately be created, and the new newspaper, hour by hour, will win for itself a leading position in the Social-Democratic movement, without looking back-wards, without going into details of the past, but only firmly and steadfastly leading the working class in the present arena of struggle.
I conclude by once again asking you to agree to meet me and by expressing the general confidence of us Bol-sheviks in the usefulness, importance and necessity of working jointly with you.
Sincerely yours, V.

P.
(MAJORITY) To Motya and Kostya, Members of the Majority of the Odessa organisation Dear Comrades, I have received your “Letter to the Comrades”.
I shall not publish it—indeed you do not ask me to do so.
But I consider it my duty to reply to you.
I have more than once stated in print what I am repeating to you now.
It is useless to complain and mourn over the split.
We must work hard to do away with it, we must think how to unite, and not indulge in platitudes and lamentation.
Complain-ing about the struggle of two parties and creating a third, and a secret one at that, as you have done, hiding yourselves from both organisations—means intensifying the split.
If you have been expelled for violating the rules of the organ-isation, it serves you right, and it’s no use trying to muddle things by making out that you were expelled for your opinions, for your conciliatory attitude, and not because of your disruptive activities.
An “inaugural congress” is an empty phrase.
Just think a bit, the tiniest little bit, what groups precisely should send their delegates, and how many from each? Just think a tiny bit how you would react to the idea of an inaugural meeting without a basis of voting rights.
Would you not call it charlatanry? * The bearers of these pseudonyms have not been identified.
—Ed.
Why do you say nothing about the idea of two congresses, that of the Majority and the Minority, held at the same time and in the same place? This idea was put forward by the C.
C.
and by Proletary.
347 Would it not be easier to hold two congresses from the existing two parties than to start by creating a third (on which you will waste months, if not years) and then to convene three congresses? What idiot is going to submit to an “inaugural congress” without knowing beforehand whether the Social-Democrats will really be represented there, which of them exactly, and in what proportions? The slogan of “two congresses” has in its favour 1) the assent of one party of the two; 2) full readiness for a con-gress on the part of the Majority and the fact that its stand-ards for convocation and the rights of its congress were made known; 3) the possibility of achieving the same thing very rapidly in the groups and organisations of the other party: by publicly listing all groups, getting their opinions, and publishing draft rules of the congress.
But all that your slogan of an “inaugural congress” has in its favour is the whining of certain whimperers, for not a single section of the Party knows the basis of this con-gress in any respect whatever.
You are simply people of little faith and weak nerves.
The sight of an unclean disease and ugly pimples has made you turn away.
This is under-standable, humanly speaking, but irrational.
We think that one must not turn away, that a third party will not get us anywhere, whereas the two existing ones will unite after all, albeit not at once and not without painful treatment.
Written at the end of October-beginning of November 1 9 0 5 Sent from Geneva to Odessa First published in 1 9 3 1 Printed from the originalQPW 162 TO MAXIM GORKY Wednesday, August 14, 1907 Dear Alexei Maximovich, We arrived here today with Meshkovsky and tomorrow we are going to Stuttgart.
348 It is very, very important that you, too, should be there.
349 For one thing, you were appointed officially by the C.
C.
(with a consultative voice).
Secondly, it would be very good to see you, as it may be a long time before we meet.
Thirdly, it is only a matter of a day’s journey from where you are and it will last not more than a week (it is not London!).
It will not be at all late if you leave on Sunday or even Monday.
In short, everything is in favour of your coming.
I wish you would, health permitting.
Don’t miss this opportunity of seeing the international socialists at work—it is some-thing quite, quite different from a general acquaintance and mere chatting.
The next congress will not be held for another three years.
Besides, we shall never be able to discuss all our business by mail unless we meet.
In short, come without fail.
Au revoir! My best regards to Maria Fyodorovna.

LUNACHARSKY Dear An.
Vas.
, I have received your pamphlet at last—the first part arrived quite a long time ago.
351 I kept waiting for the end so as to read it as a whole, but I waited in vain.
So far the third supplement is still missing (“How Marx Re-garded”, etc.
).
This is most unfortunate for, not having the complete manuscript, one is afraid of giving it to the press to be set up.
If this third supplement has not been sent yet, please try to send it as quickly as possible.
The money (200 rubles) has been sent to you; did you receive it? As regards the content of your pamphlet, I liked it very much, as did all our people here.
A most interesting pam-phlet and excellently written.
The only thing is, there are many unguarded statements, so to speak—I mean the kind of things which various S.
R.
s, Mensheviks, syndica-lists, etc.
, will pick on.
We discussed collectively whether we should touch it up or give an explanation in the preface.
We decided on the latter course, as it would be a pity to touch it up; it would impair the integral character of the exposition.
The conscientious and attentive reader will be able to understand you correctly, of course; nevertheless, you should specially guard yourself against false interpreters, whose name is legion.
For example, we must of course criticise Bebel, and I do not approve of Trotsky, who re-cently sent us a hymn of praise to Essen and German Social-Democracy in general.
You are right in pointing out that in Essen Bebel was wrong both on the question of mili-tarism and on the question of colonial policy (or rather onthe character of the radicals’ fight at Stuttgart on this subject).
352 But it should be mentioned in this connection that these are the mistakes of a person with whom we are going the same way, and which can only be rectified in this, Marxist, Social-Democratic way.
For there are many people among us (you probably do not see their press) who maliciously chuckle over Bebel for the sake of glori-fying Socialist-Revolutionarism, syndicalism (à la Yezersky, Kozlovsky, Krichevsky—see Obrazovaniye, etc.
) and anar-chism.
In my opinion, all your ideas can and should always be set forth in such a way that criticism will be aimed not at orthodoxy, not at the Germans in general, but at opportunism.
Then it will be impossible to misinterpret you.
Then the conclusion will be clear, namely, that Bol-shevism, taking a lesson from the Germans and profiting by their experience (this demand of yours is a thousand times correct!), will take all that is vital from syndicalism in order to kill Russian syndicalism and opportunism.
To do this is easier and more natural for us Bolsheviks than for anyone else, for in the revolution we have always fought against parliamentary cretinism and Plekhanovite oppor-tunism.
And it is we alone who, from the revolutionary and not from the pedantic Cadet standpoint of Plekhanov and Co.
, can refute syndicalism, which produces no end of confusion (particularly dangerous confusion in the case of Russia).
Proletary No.
17 has come out and has been sent to you, and so has Zarnitsy.
353 Have you received them? Do you read Tovarishch? How do you like it now? What about your remembering old times and poking fun at them in verse? Write please.
All the very best.

M.
, My wife and I arrived here a few days ago.
We both caught cold on the way.
We are settling down here just anyhow, for the time being temporarily, so everything is bad.
I was very glad to have your letter: it would really be fine to make a trip to Capri! I shall definitely find time one of these days to visit you.
At present, unfortunately, it is impossible.
We have come here with the commission to establish a newspaper: to transfer Proletary here from Fin-land.
We haven’t decided yet finally whether we shall choose Geneva or some other city.
In any case we must hurry and we have our hands full with the new arrangements.
It would be nice to pay you a visit in the spring or summer, when things here are well under way! What is the best time for Capri? How is your health? How do you feel? Does your work go well? I heard while passing through Berlin that you and Lunacharsky have been touring Italy and, in particu-lar, have been in Rome.
354 Do you like Italy? Do you meet many Russians? It would be best for me to visit you when you are not engaged on anything big, so that we can wander about at leisure and chat together.
Have you received my book (the first volume of collected articles for twelve years) 355 ? I asked for it to be sent to you from St.
Petersburg.
My very best regards to Maria Fyodorovna.

M.
and M.
F.
, I received your express letter today.
The idea of dropping in on you on Capri is delightfully tempting, dash it! You have painted such an attractive picture that I have definite-ly made up my mind to come out, and I shall try to bring my wife with me.
Only I am still uncertain about the date; at present I must give all my attention to Proletary, it must be established and work got going smoothly at all costs.
That will take a month or two at least.
But it must be done.
By the spring we shall find ourselves drinking the white wine of Capri, looking at Naples and chatting with you.
Incidentally, I have begun to study Italian and, as a learner, I pounced at once on the address written by Maria Fyodorovna: expresso instead of espresso! Let’s have that dictionary! As for the shipment of Proletary, you have brought it on your own head by writing.
You won’t be able to wriggle away from us now so easily! A heap of commissions have to be given straight away to M.
F.
: 1) To find the secretary of the union of steamship em-ployees (there must be such a union!) serving on steamers that maintain communications with Russia.
2) To find out from him where the ships come from and go to, and how often.
He must arrange weekly shipments for us without fail.
How much will that cost? He must find someone for us who is punctual (are there punctual men among the Italians?).
Will they want an address in Russia (in Odessa, say, for delivering the newspapers) or could small quantities be kept temporarily with some Ita-lian innkeeper in Odessa? This is extremely important for us.
3) If M.
F.
cannot take care of this herself—making all the arrangements, finding the necessary people, instruct-ing them, checking, etc.
, let her be sure to put us in touch with this secretary—we shall then write to him directly.
This thing is urgent.
In two or three weeks’ time we hope to publish Proletary here and it will have to be dispatched at once.
356 Well—until we meet on Capri! Now, A.
M.
, take care of yourself.
Yours, V.
Ulyanov Sent from Geneva to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original166 TO THEODORE ROTHSTEIN 357 January 29, 1908 Dear Comrade, About two-and-a-half to three months ago in Finland I received your letter with the reminder about the debt, which I handed over to the C.
C.
358 Now the “Finnish smash-up” has compelled me to move to Geneva, involving consider-able time and trouble.
Today one of the comrades here has told me that you are insistently reminding about the debt and that the Englishman is even threatening public-ation in the press (!), etc.
I shall immediately write again to Russia to say that the debt must be repaid.
But, you know, it is extremely difficult to do this now! The Finnish smash-up, the arrests of many comrades, the seizure of papers, the need to remove printing-presses and to send many comrades abroad all this has entailed heavy and unforeseen expenditure.
The Party’s financial plight is all the more unfortunate because during two years everyone has grown out of the habit of working illegally and has been “spoilt” by legal or semi-legal activities.
Secret organisations have had to be organised almost afresh.
This is costing a mint of money.
And all the intellectualist, philistine elements are abandoning the Party; the exodus of the intelligentsia is enormous.
Those remaining are pure proletarians who have no opportunity of making open collections.
It should be explained to the Englishman and brought home to him that the conditions at the time of the Second Duma when the loan was made were quite different, that the Party will, of course, pay its debts, but it is impossible, inconceivable to demand this just now, that it would be usury, and so on.
We must convince the Englishman.
It is hardly likely he will be able to get the money.
And making a row will lead him nowhere.
If I am not mistaken, the members of the factions signed separately and the responsibility is by factions too.
All the best.

M.
, I am writing to you about two matters.
Firstly, about the Semashko affair.
If you do not know him personally, it is not worth while your intervening in the matter described below.
If you do know him, it is worth while.
L.
Martov made a “statement” in the Berne Social-De-mocratic newspaper to the effect that Semashko was not a delegate at the Stuttgart Congress but merely a journalist.
Not a word about his being a member of the Social-Dem-ocratic Party.
This is a vile attack by a Menshevik on a Bolshevik who is in prison.
I have already sent my official statement as the representative of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
in the International Bureau.
359 If you know Semashko personally, or knew him in Nizhni-Novgorod, you should write without fail to the same newspaper saying that you are shocked at Martov’s statement, that you are personally acquainted with Semashko as a Social-Democrat, and that you are sure that he is not implicated in the affairs inflated by the international police.
I am quoting below the news-paper’s address and the full text of Martov’s statement, which M.
F.
will translate for you.
Write to the editors yourself in Russian, and ask M.
F.
to append a German translation.
The second matter.
All three of us have come together here now, having been sent from Russia to establish Pro-letary (Bogdanov, I and one “Praktik”).
Everything is in running order, in a day or two we shall publish an announce-ment.
360 You are on our list of contributors.
Drop us a lineas to whether you could give us something for the first issues (something after the manner of your “notes on phil-istinism” in Novaya Zhizn, or fragments from a story you are writing 361, etc.
).
All the very best.

Petersburg one.
364 Send me a copy of your letter to Sienkiewicz, if you have one (indicating when it was sent)—but Sienkiewicz will no doubt publish it since it is an opinion poll.
365 Your plans are very interesting and I should like to come.
But, you will agree, I cannot very well throw up the Party job, which needs organising immediately.
366 It is difficult to get a new job going.
I can’t throw it up.
We shall have it going in about a couple of months or so, and then I shall be free to tear myself away for a week or two.
I agree with you a thousand times about the need for systematically combating political decadence, renegadism, whining, and so forth.
I do not think that there would be any disagreement between us about “society” and the “youth”.
The significance of the intellectuals in our Party is declining; news comes from all sides that the intelligen-tsia is fleeing the Party.
And a good riddance to these scoun-drels.
The Party is purging itself from petty-bourgeois dross.
The workers are having a bigger say in things.
The role of the worker-professionals is increasing.
All this is wonder-ful, and I am sure that your “kicks” must be understood in the same sense.
Now—how are we to exert influence, what exactly should our literature be? Symposia or Proletary? Of course, the easier thing is to reply: not or, but and—the reply will be irreproachable but of little practical value.
We must have legal symposia, of course; our comrades in St.
Peters-burg are working on them by the sweat of the brow, and I, too, have been working on them after London, while sitting in Kwakalla.
367 If possible, all efforts should be made to support them and continue these symposia.
368 But my experience from London up to November 1907 (half a year!) has convinced me that no systematic legal literature can now be produced.
I am convinced that what the Party now needs is a regular political organ, consist-ently and vigorously pursuing a policy of struggle against disintegration and despondency—a Party organ, a political newspaper.
Many people in Russia do not believe in a foreign-based organ.
But this is an error, and our collegium knew what it was doing when it decided to transfer Pro-letary here.
That it is difficult to organise, set it up and run it—goes without saying.
But it has to be done and it will be done.
Why shouldn’t literary criticism be included in it? Too little space? I don’t know, of course, your system of work-ing.
Unfortunately, when we have met, we spent more time chattering than talking business.
If you don’t like writing small, short, periodical (weekly or fortnightly) articles, if you prefer to work on big things—then, of course, I would not advise you to interrupt it.
It will be of greater be-nefit! If, however, you are inclined towards joint work in a political newspaper—why not continue and make a regular feature of the genre which you began with “Notes on Phil-istinism “ in Novaya Zhizn, and began very well, in my opinion? I wrote to you about this “with an ulterior mo-tive” in one of the first letters, thinking: if it appeals to him, he will seize on the idea.
And it seems to me that in your last letter you are seizing on it after a fashion.
Or am I mistaken? How great would be the gain, both for Party work through the newspaper, which would not be so one-sided as it previously was, and for literary work, which would be more closely linked with Party work,with systematic, continuous influence on the Party! There should be not “forays”, but a solid onslaught all along the line, without stops or gaps; Bolshevik Social-Democrats should not only attack all kinds of duffers piecemeal, but should conquer all and everything as the Japanese conquered Manchuria from the Russians.
Of the three subjects that you mention for the symposia (philosophy, literary criticism, and current tactics) one-and-a-half would go into the political newspaper, into Proletary, viz.
: current tactics and a good half of the liter-ary criticism.
Ah, there is nothing good about all those special, long articles of literary criticism scattered through various semi-Party and non-Party periodicals! We should try to take a step away from this old, intellectualist, stuffed-shirt manner, that is, we should link literary criticism, too, more closely with Party work, with Party leadership.
That is what the adult Social-Democratic Parties in Europe are doing.
That is what we should do, too, without being afraid of the difficulties of the first steps of collective news-paper activity in this field.
Large works of literary criticism—in books, partially in periodicals.
Systematic, periodic articles, in the concert of a political newspaper, linked with Party work, in the spirit of what was begun by Novaya Zhizn—tell me, have you any incli-nation towards this, or not? The third subject is philosophy.
I am fully aware of my unpreparedness in this sphere, which prevents me from speaking about it in public.
But, as a rank-and-file Marxist, I read attentively our Party philosophers, I read attentively the empirio-monist Bogdanov and the empirio-critics Baza-rov, Lunacharsky, etc.
—and they drive me to give all my sympathy to Plekhanov! It takes physical strength to keep oneself from being carried away by the mood, as Plekhanov does! His tactics are the height of ineptitude and baseness.
In philosophy, however, he upholds the right cause.
I am for materialism against “empirio-” etc.
Can, and should, philosophy be linked with the trend of Party work? With Bolshevism? I think this should not be done at the present time.
Let our Party philosophers put in some more work on theory for a while, let them dis-pute and .
.
.
seek a meeting of minds.
For the time being, I would stand for such philosophical disputes as those be-tween materialists and “empirios” being separated from integral Party work.
I look forward to your reply, meanwhile I must conclude.

February 13, 1908 Dear An.
Vas.
, Yesterday I sent you a short note about Bringmann.
I hasten to reply to your letter of February 11.
I don’t quite understand why you should feel hurt by my letter.
Not on account of philosophy, surely! Your plan for a section of belles-lettres in Proletary and for having A.
M.
run it is an excellent one, and pleases me exceedingly.
I have in fact been dreaming of making the literature and criticism section a permanent feature in Pro-letary and having A.
M.
to run it.
But I was afraid, ter-ribly afraid of making the proposal outright, as I do not know the nature of A.
M.
’s work (and his work-bent).
If a man is busy with an important work, and if this work would suffer from him being torn away for minor things, such as a newspaper, and journalism, then it would be foolish and criminal to disturb and interrupt him! That is something I very well understand and feel.
Being on the spot, you will know best, dear An.
Vas.
If you consider that A.
M.
’s work will not suffer by his being harnessed to regular Party work (and the Party work will gain a great deal from this!), then try to arrange it.
Proletary No.
21 will come out on February 13 (26).
So there is still time.
It is desirable to have the manuscripts by Friday, which will give us plenty of time to put them in the issue which comes out on Wednesday.
If it’s some-thing urgent we could manage it even if the copy arrives on Sunday (to avoid delay, write and send it directly to my address), or even (in an extreme case!) on Monday.
You, too, must write without fail.
Won’t you send us for No.
21 either a political article on Russian affairs (10,000-16,000 characters) or an article on Ferri’s resig-nation 369 (8,000-10,000 characters)? Better still, not “either .
.
.
or”, but “both .
.
.
and”.
I send you my best regards and ask you to reply whether A.
M.
’s contribution to Proletary is being arranged.
If it is, let him begin at once, without waiting for the “meeting” and an agreement.
370 Sent from Geneva to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original170 TO MAXIM GORKY February 13, 1908 Dear Al.
M.
, I think that some of the questions you raise about our differences of opinion are a sheer misunderstanding.
Never, of course, have I thought of “chasing away the intelligen-tsia”, as the silly syndicalists do, or of denying its neces-sity for the workers’ movement.
There can be no divergence between us on any of these questions; of that I am quite sure, and since we cannot get together at the moment, we must start work together at once.
At work we shall best of all find a common language.
I am very, very pleased with your plan of writing short paragraphs for Proletary (the announcement has been sent to you).
Naturally, if you are working on something big, do not break it off.
Regarding Trotsky, I wanted to reply last time, but I forgot.
We (i.
e.
, the editorial board of Proletary, Al.
Al.
, myself and “Inok”—a very good colleague from the home Bolsheviks) decided straight away to invite him on to Proletary.
We wrote him a letter, proposing and outlining a theme.
By general agreement we signed it the “Editorial Board of Proletary”, so as to put the matter on a more collegial footing (I personally, for example, had had a big fight with Trotsky, a regular fierce battle in 1903-05 when he was a Menshevik).
Whether there was something in the form of our letter that offended Trotsky, I do not know, but he sent us a letter, not written by him: “On Comrade Trotsky’s instructions” the editorial board of Pro-letary was informed that he refused to write, he was too busy.
In my opinion, this is mere posturing.
At the London Congress, 371 too, he acted the poseur.
I don’t know really whether he will go with the Bolsheviks.
.
.
.
The Mensheviks here have issued an announcement about the monthly Golos Sotsial-Demokrata 372 over the signatures of Plekhanov, Axelrod, Dan, Martov and Martynov.
I shall get it and send it to you.
The struggle may become sharper.
But Trotsky wants to stand “above the contending fac-tions”.
.
.
.
It is in regard to materialism as a world outlook that I think I disagree with you in substance.
Not the “materialist conception of history” (our “empirios” 373 do not deny that), but philosophical materialism.
That the Anglo-Saxons and Germans owed their philistinism to “materialism”, and the Romance peoples their anarchism, is something I emphatic-ally dispute.
Materialism, as a philosophy, was everywhere pushed into the background by them.
Neue Zeit, that most sober and well-informed organ, is indifferent to philosophy, was never a zealous supporter of philosophical material-ism, and of late has been publishing the empirio-critics without a single reservation.
It is wrong, absolutely wrong to think that dead philistinism could be deduced from the materialism which Marx and Engels taught! All the phil-istine trends in Social-Democracy are most of all at war with philosophical materialism, they lean towards Kant, neo-Kantianism, the critical philosophy.
No, the philosophy which Engels substantiated in Anti-Dühring keeps philistin-ism at arm’s length.
Plekhanov does harm to this philosophy by linking the struggle here with the factional struggle, but after all no Russian Social-Democrat ought to confuse the present Plekhanov with the old Plekhanov.
Al.
Al.
has just now left me.
I shall communicate with him again about the “meeting”.
If you insist—it could be arranged for a couple of days and very soon at that.
All the best.
Lenin Sent from Geneva to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original171 TO MAXIM GORKY March 16, 1908 Dear A.
M.
, It’s a pity I can’t manage to go and see you.
A reply has come from Brussels 374 and here there is no delay.
But there is no money and no time, and I cannot abandon the newspaper.
Judging from the fact that you own a nanny-goat, I see that you are in a good humour, the right frame of mind, and life is normal with you.
With us things are going none too well.
We are pretty much at loggerheads with Al.
Al.
over this philosophy.
I am neglecting the newspaper because of my hard bout of philosophy: one day I read one of the empirio-critics and swear like a fishwife, next day I read another and swear still worse.
And Innokenty scolds me— and quite right too—for neglecting Proletary.
Things are not running smoothly.
Ah, well, it’s only natural.
Things will come right.
It would be fine if you could manage to write for Prolet-ary without your major works suffering.
With warm greetings and best regards to A.
Vas.
and Maria Fyodorovna.
Yours, Lenin Sent from Geneva to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original172 TO MAXIM GORKY To A.
M.
, private March 24, 1908 Dear A.
M.
, I have received your letter concerning my fight with the Machists.
I quite understand and respect your feelings and I ought to say that I get something similar from my St.
Petersburg friends, but I am very deeply convinced that you are mistaken.
You must understand—and you will, of course—that once a Party man has become convinced that a certain doc-trine is grossly fallacious and harmful, he is obliged to come out against it.
I would not be kicking up a row if I were not absolutely convinced (and I am becoming more and more convinced of this every day as I study the original sources of wisdom of Bazarov, Bogdanov and Co.
) that their book is ridiculous, harmful, philistine, fideist—the whole of it, from beginning to end, from branch to root, to Mach and Avenarius.
Plekhanov, at bottom, is entirely right in being against them, only he is unable or unwilling or too lazy to say so concretely, in detail, simply, without unnecessarily frightening his readers with philosophical nuances.
And at all costs I shall say it in my own way.
What kind of “reconciliation” can there be here, dear A.
M.
? Why, it is ludicrous even to mention it.
A fight is absolutely inevitable.
And Party people should devote their efforts not to slurring it over, putting it off or dodg-ing it, but to ensuring that essential Party work does not suffer in practice.
That is what you should be concerned about, and nine-tenths of the Bolsheviks in Russia will help you in this and heartily thank you for it.
How is this to be done? By “neutrality”? No.
There cannot and will not be any neutrality on such an issue.
If it is possible to speak of neutrality, it can only be in a relative sense: we must separate all this fight from the faction.
So far, you have been writing “from the outside”, keeping away from the factional publications; go on writing in this way.
Only so will the faction not be committed, not be involved, not be compelled tomorrow or the day after to decide, to vote, i.
e.
, to turn the fight into a chronic, pro-tracted, hopeless affair.
That is why I am against allowing any kind of philosophy in the journal.
375 I know I am being abused for this: he wants to stop other people’s mouths, while he has not yet opened his own! But just think it over coolly.
A journal with philosophy.
No.
1—three articles of Ba-zarov, Bogdanov and Lunacharsky against Plekhanov.
One article of mine saying that Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism=Berdayevism and reactionary clericalism.
No.
2—three times three keyed up articles of Bogdanov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky against Plekhanov and Lenin.
One article of mine, proving from another angle that Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism=reactionary clericalism.
No.
3—howling and cursing.
I could write six or a dozen articles against Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism, one article against each author and each aspect of his views.
Can this drag on in this way? How long? Will this not make a split inevitable through endless exacerbation and embitterment? Will this not bind the faction to make a decision: decide, analyse, and end the “discussion” by a vote.
.
.
.
Think this over carefully, if you fear a split.
Will the practical workers undertake to distribute books with such a “fight”? Isn’t another way better: go on writing as before, outside the factional publications.
Do your scrapping on the side, for the time being the faction can wait.
If there is a chance of weakening the inevitable animosity, it can only be in this way, I think.
You write: the Mensheviks will gain from a fight.
You are mistaken, deeply mistaken, A.
M.
! They will gain if the Bolshevik faction does not dissociate itself from the phi-losophy of the three Bolsheviks.
In that case, they willdefinitely win.
But if the philosophical fight goes on out-side the faction, the Mensheviks will be definitely reduced to a political line and that will be the death of them.
I say: separate the fight from the faction.
Of course, such a separation, on living persons, is rather difficult and painful.
It needs time.
It needs solicitous comrades.
Here the practical workers will help, here you should help, here it is a question of “psychology”, and you know best.
I think you could help a lot here—provided that, on reading my book against the Studies, * you don’t become as furious against me as I became against them.
As regards the journal, think it over carefully and answer me soon.
I am a little doubtful whether it is worth while for us to make the journey to you together at present.
Why jangle nerves unnecessarily? Why draw out the torture .
.
.
there is no avoiding a fight.
Would it not be better to settle this business of the journal simply, without long negotia-tions and ceremonial and futile meetings.
I am merely putting questions to you in order to consult you.
Best regards to M.
F.
I shall most certainly come to Capri and try to bring my wife along, only I should like to do this independently of the philosophical fight.
All the very best.

Privately, about philosophy: I cannot return your compliments and I think you will soon take yours back.
As for me, I have parted company (and probably for a long time) with the preachers of “the union of scientific social-ism and religion” and with all Machists as well.
Sent from Geneva to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 3 4 Printed from the original175 TO MAXIM GORKY April 16, 1908 Dear Al.
M.
, Today I received your letter and hasten to reply.
It is useless and harmful for me to come: I cannot and will not talk to people who are preaching the union of scientific socialism and religion.
The time for notebooks 377 is past.
It’s no use arguing, and it’s stupid to jangle one’s nerves for nothing.
Philosophy must be separated from Party (factional) affairs: the decision of the Bolshevik Centre 378 makes this obligatory.
I have already sent to be printed the most formal declar-ation of war.
379 There is no longer any room for diplomacy here—of course, I am speaking of diplomacy not in the bad sense, but in the good sense of the word.
“Good” diplomacy on your part, dear A.
M.
(if you, too, have not come to believe in God), should consist in separat-ing our joint (i.
e.
, including myself) affairs from philosophy.
A talk on other matter than philosophy won’t come off now: it would be unnatural.
Incidentally, if these other matters, not philosophical, but Proletary matters, for exam-ple, really demand talks just now, and at your place, I could come (I don’t know whether I shall find the money: there are difficulties at present), but I repeat: only on condition that I do not speak about philosophy or religion.
And I definitely intend coming to have a talk with you when I am free and through with my work.
All the very best.

M.
, I have received the telegram from you and M.
F.
and am sending my refusal today or tomorrow morning.
I re-peat, on no account is it permissible to mix the disputes of writers about philosophy with a Party (i.
e.
, factional) matter.
I have already written about this to An.
Vas.
380 and to avoid any misinterpretations or incorrect conclu-sions from my refusal to come I repeat it for all the com-rades.
We should continue to conduct our factional work harmoniously: none of us has regretted the policy which we pursued and implemented at the time of the revolution.
Hence, it is our duty to defend it before the Party.
We can only do this all together, and we should do it in Proletary and in all Party work.
If, in the course of it, A should inveigh against B, or B inveigh against A, on account of philosophy, we must do this as a thing apart, that is, without interfering with the work.
I shouldn’t like you and the comrades to put a bad con-struction on my refusal to come.
I am very sorry, but the whole situation and the state of the editorial board pre-vent my coming.
All the very best.
Yours, Lenin We are expecting to receive the promised article about the Rome strike from An.

We are expecting help for Proletary from all writers: we are all answerable to our comrades in Russia, who are dissatis-fied with it.

VOROVSKY 381 Dear friend, Thanks for your letter.
Both your “suspicions” are wrong.
I was not suffering from nerves, but our position is difficult.
A split with Bogdanov is imminent.
The true cause is offence at the sharp criticism of his philosophical views at lectures (not at all in the newspaper).
Now Bogdanov is hunting out every kind of difference of opinion.
Together with Alexinsky, who is kicking up a terrible row and with whom I have been compelled to break off all relations, he has dragged the boycott out into the light of day.
They are trying to bring about a split on empirio-mon-istic and boycott grounds.
The storm will burst very soon.
A fight at the coming conference is inevitable.
A split is highly probable.
I shall leave the faction as soon as the policy of the “Left” and of true “boycottism” gets the up-per hand.
I invited you, thinking that your speedy arrival would help to pacify.
In August (new style) we are never-theless counting on you without fail as a participant in the conference.
Be sure to arrange things so as to be able to travel abroad.
We shall send money for the journey to all the Bolsheviks.
Issue the slogan locally: mandates to be given only to local, and only to active Party workers.
We earnestly request you to write for our newspaper.
We can now pay for articles and will pay regularly.
All the best.

You, of course, have heard from Comrade Tyszka about our internal struggle among the Bolsheviks.
Your article against the otzovists and ultimatumists 387 has pleased everyone very much 388; it is a pity that you write so rarely in Russian; you prefer the rich Social-Democratic Party of the Germans to the poor Social-Democratic Party of the Russians.

LYUBIMOV 390 Dear Mark, I am sending you for Lyova my reply to the Capriotes.
391 If he considers it necessary, let him make a copy for Inok, and then send the letter to Capri—I don’t know the address.
I think it could be sent in two envelopes: the outer one inscribed “Signor Massimo Gorki, Villa Blaesus, Capri, Italie”, and the inner one: “For the Executive Committee of the School”.
I don’t know any other address.
As regards Trotsky, I must say that I shall be most vi-gorously opposed to helping him if he rejects (and he has already rejected it!) equality on the editorial board, proposed to him by a member of the C.
C.
Without a settlement of this question by the Executive Committee of the Bol-shevik Centre, no steps to help Trotsky are permissible.
Consequently, the Economic Committee is entitled to agree to the printing of Pravda 392 at the Proletary printing-press only if this will not be help for a new faction (for Trotsky is founding a new faction, whereas the Bolshevik C.
C.
member proposed to him instead that he should come into the Party) but a strictly commercial deal, for payment, as with any other person, provided the compositors are disengaged, etc.
I insist most categorically that the ques-tion of the attitude to Pravda shall still be decided by the Executive Committee of the Bolshevik Centre and that pend-ing this decision not a single step in the way of help shall be taken, nor shall we bind ourselves in any way.
All the best.

, I have received No.

394 I object to Trotsky’s signature; signatures must be omitted.
(I have not yet read the articles.
) As regards Proletary, I think we should insert in it 1) an article on the elections in St.
Petersburg (in connection with the claptrap of Rech 395 and Vodovozov, if Rech has not misreported him); 2) on the Swedish strike—a summing-up article is essential; 3) ditto on the Spanish events 396 ; 4) on the Mensheviks, in connection with their (very vile) polemic with the Geneva (Georgien 397) anti-liquidator; 5) in the supplement as a special sheet, an answer to the “Open Letter” of Maximov and Co.
398 A proper answer must be given to them so that these scoundrels do not mislead people by their lies.
After three weeks’ holiday, I am beginning to come round.
I think I could take No.
4 and 5, upon myself, if need be No.
1 as well, but I am still afraid to promise.
Write me your opinion and the exact deadlines.
What else is there for Proletary? Nos.
2 and 3 can be made up from Vorwärts; I shall send it to you, if you will undertake to write.
As regards Pravda, have you read Trotsky’s letter to Inok? If you have, I hope it has convinced you that Trotsky behaves like a despicable careerist and factionalist of the Ryazanov-and-Co.
type? Either equality on the editorial board, subordination to the C.

LYUBIMOV Dear Mark, I entirely agree, of course, to your making free use of my letter for a report or for publication.
* Bear in mind, though, that I am writing an article ** for Proletary in which I bluntly describe the gang of scoundrels, Maximov and Co.
, as canaille, and call their school nothing but a “Yerogin’s hostel”.
*** And so, to avoid misunderstanding: I agree to speak “mildly” only to workers who address me personally over their own signatures.
Maximov and Co.
, however, are a band of adventurers who have enticed some workers into their Yerogin hostel.
To avoid contradictions, do not circulate my letter among our people, but send it exclusively to organisations with this reservation (the reservation had better be published too): “The appropriate reply to the company of offended writ-ers, unrecognised philosophers and ridiculed god-build-ers 400 who have hidden away their so-called “school” from the Party, will be given in Proletary.
The present letter, however, is Lenin’s personal reply to those workers who have addressed him personally.
” I should advise everyone either not to go to Bogdanov’s lecture—or to answer him in such a way as once and for all to kill the desire to butt in.
It is base cowardice to go * The reference is to a letter to students at the Capri Party School (see present edition, Vol.

gate-crashing on a faction from which he has already been ejected.
There is nothing more harmful now than sentiment-alising.
A complete break and war, more determined than that against the Mensheviks.
This war will quickly teach the fools who have still “not made things out”.

And Plekhanov’s “Dnevnik”! 401 Don’t forget I am waiting.
Written at the beginning of September 1 9 0 9 Sent from Bombon (France) to Paris First published in 1 9 3 3 Printed from the original183 TO MAXIM GORKY November 16, 1909 Dear Alexei Maximovich, I have been fully convinced all the time that you and Comrade Mikhail were the most hardened factionalists of the new faction, with whom it would be silly of me to try and talk in a friendly way.
Today for the first time I met Comrade Mikhail, and had a heart-to-heart chat with him both about affairs and about you, and I perceived that I had been cruelly mistaken.
Believe me, the philosopher Hegel was right: life proceeds by contradictions, and living contradictions are so much richer, more varied and deeper in content than they may seem at first sight to a man’s mind.
I regarded the school as merely the centre of a new faction.
This has turned out to be wrong—not in the sense that it was not the centre of a new faction (the school was this centre and is so at the present time), but in the sense that this was incomplete, not the whole truth.
Subjectively, certain people made such a centre out of the school, objective-ly, it was such, but in addition the school drew to it real front-rank workers from real working-class life.
What hap-pened was that, besides the contradiction between the old and the new faction, a contradiction developed on Capri, between some of the Social-Democratic intellectuals and the workers from Russia, who will bring Social-Democracy on to the true path at all costs and whatever happens, and who will do so despite all the squabbling and dissension abroad, despite the “incidents”, and so on and so forth.
People like Mikhail are a guarantee of it.
Moreover, it turned out that a contradiction developed in the school between elements of the Capri Social-Democratic intel-ligentsia.
I gathered from Mikhail that you are taking things hard, dear A.
M.
You have seen the working class and Social-Democratic movement from an aspect and in forms and manifestations which already more than once in the history of Russia and Western Europe have led intellectuals of little faith to despair of the workers’ movement and Social-Democracy.
I am confident that this will not happen in your case, and after my talk with Mikhail I want to shake your hand heartily.
With your gifts as an artist you have rendered such a tremendous service to the working-class movement of Russia—and indeed not only of Russia— and will render a still greater service yet, that it is on no account permissible for you to fall a prey to moods of de-pression evoked by episodes of the struggle abroad.
Con-ditions occur when the course of the working-class move-ment inevitably gives rise to this struggle abroad, and to splits, dissension and the quarrelling among the circles —but this is not because of the workers’ movement being intrinsically weak or Social-Democracy intrinsically er-roneous, but because the elements out of which the work-ing class has to forge its Party are too heterogeneous and diverse in calibre.
The working class will forge it in any case, it will forge an excellent revolutionary Social-Dem-ocratic Party in Russia, and it will do so more speedily than sometimes seems likely from the standpoint of the thrice-accursed emigrant position; it will forge it more surely than might be imagined if one were to judge by some external manifestations and individual episodes.
People like Mikhail are a guarantee of that.
All the very best to you and to Maria Fyodorovna.
I am now hopeful that we shall meet again and not as enemies.
Yours, Lenin Wl.
Oulianoff, 4, Rue Marie Rose, 4 Paris, XIV Sent from Paris to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original184 TO MAXIM GORKY Dear A.
M.
, You are wrong in asking me to come over.
Why should I be slanging Maximov, Lunacharsky, etc.
? You yourself write about keeping at loggerheads strictly among ourselves and yet you invite us to do the same in public.
It’s no model.
And about repelling the workers, you are wrong there too.
If they accept our invitation and call on us, we shall have a chat with them and fight for the views of a certain news-paper, 402 which certain factionalists are abusing (I heard this long ago from Lyadov and others) as being a deadly bore, a semi-literate and useless paper which does not believe in the proletariat or socialism.
As regards a new split, your arguments don’t hang to-gether.
On the one hand, both are nihilists (and “Slav anarchists”—why, my dear man, the non-Slav Europeans at times like ours fought, cursed and split a hundred times worse than we do!)—and, on the other hand, the split will be not less deep than that between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.
If it is a question of the “nihilism” of the “log-gerheads”, of the semi-literacy, etc.
, of someone who does not believe in what he writes, etc.
—then, the split is not deep or it is not a split at all.
And if the split is deeper than that between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks—then it is not a question of nihilism, not a question of writers who do not believe in what they write.
It doesn’t hold water, really! You are wrong about the present split and justly * say: “I understand people but not their deeds.
” What strikes you and Maximov in Proletary as insin-cerity and futility, etc.
, is due to a totally different view-point on the entire present moment (and, of course, on Marxism).
We have been marking time for almost two years now, torturing questions which still seem “disput-* An addition “justly”: I make a reservation.
Without under-standing their deeds one cannot understand people either, unless it be .

outwardly.
That is to say, it is possible to understand the psy-chology of one or other participant of a struggle, but not the meaning of the struggle, not its party and political significance.
able” to Maximov, but which events decided long ago.
And if we were to continue “disputing” about them, we would still be vainly marking time.
But by parting com-pany, we shall show the workers clearly, directly and definitely, two ways out.
The Social-Democratic workers will make their choice easily and swiftly, for the tactics of preserving (in storage cans) the revolutionary words of 1905-06 instead of applying the revolutionary method to a new, different situation, to a changed epoch, which de-mands different methods and different forms of organisa-tion—these tactics are dead.
The proletariat is moving towards revolution and will come to it, but not in the way it did prior to 1905.
To one who “believes” that the pro-letariat will make it, but who does not understand this “not in the way”—to him our position is bound to seem insin-cere, futile, tedious, based on lack of faith in the proletariat and socialism, etc.
, etc.
The divergence resulting from this is, undoubtedly, deep enough to make a split—at least abroad—inevitable.
But it does not come anywhere near the split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, if one is to speak of the depth of the split in the Party, in Social-Democracy, among Marxists.
You are surprised that I fail to see Mikhail’s hysteria, lack of discipline (it is not for you to say, nor for Mikhail to listen) and other bad qualities.
Well, I have had a little opportunity of testing him: I thought that nothing would come of a conversation between you and me, that there was no sense in writing.
Under the impression of my talk with Mikhail, I wrote at once, in the heat of the moment, without even reading through the letter, without putting it off until the next day.
The next day I thought: I have been foolish enough to believe Mikhail.
But it turned out that for all his enthusiasm Mikhail was right to some extent, for we did have our talk, you and I—not without hitches, of course, and not without Proletary being annihilated, but that can’t be helped! All the very best.

SKVORTSOV -STEPANOV 403 Dear friend, I have received your letter of September 20, 1909, and was extremely glad to hear from you.
It is a pity there was no news from you earlier—we are now terribly isolated here; we tried to get in touch with you and Vyach.
, but failed.
These are indeed hellishly difficult years and a pos-sibility of contacts with old friends is ten times more valu-able for that reason.
I shall answer your letter point by point.
You have seen the newspaper up to December 1908.
Since then much water has flowed under the bridge.
With the so-called “Lefts” we have a complete split, which was made good in the spring of 1909.
If you come across my book on philosophy (I sent it to you immediately it came out, i.
e.
, in the beginning of the summer of 1909) and the newspaper for 1909, you will hardly say that we are making concessions to the silly Lefts.
There is a com-plete and formal split with Maximov and the Maximovites.
An out-and-out fight.
They may set up their own organ, or they may not.
They are stirring things up in St.
Peters-burg and Odessa, but they cannot become a force; it is the death agony of “otzovism-ultimatumism”, in my opinion.
The split with Maximov and Co.
cost us no little energy and time, but I think it was inevitable and will be useful in the long run.
Knowing your views, I think, I am even confident, that we are in agreement here.
As to what you say about it being time to “liquidate the belief in a second coming of the general-democratic onset”, I definitely do not agree with you there.
You would only be playing into the hands of the otzovists (who are very prone to such “maximalism”: the bourgeois revolu-tion is behind us—ahead is the “purely proletarian” one) and the extreme Right-wing Menshevik liquidators.
(In-cidentally: have you heard about the split among the Men-sheviks? Plekhanov has left the editorial board of their newspaper, Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, and the editorial board of their collective work: The Social Movement in Rus-sia in the Twentieth Century.
In August 1909 he published Dnevnik No.
9, where he called the Mensheviks the accom-plices of the liquidators, 404 and said about Potresov “he is no comrade of mine”, and that Potresov had ceased to be a revolutionary, and so on.
Things with us are moving towards an alignment with the Plekhanovite Mensheviks with the aim of strengthening the Party.
) But the main thing, in my opinion, is that such a view is theoretically wrong.
The “German line” is possible—without doubt.
And we frankly recognised that as early as the beginning of 1908.
But this possibility can become a reality only through a number of “general-democratic” onsets (or upsurges, or crises, etc.
) just as France came to the end of the “gener-al-democratic” onsets not after 1789-93, but after 1871 (i.
e.
, after 1830, 1848, and 1871), and Germany not in 1849-50, but also after 1871, i.
e.
, after the Verfassungsstreit * of the sixties.
Struve, Guchkov and Stolypin are trying their hardest to “copulate” and produce a Bismarckian Russia— but nothing comes of it.
Nothing.
They’re impotent.
All the signs show, and they themselves admit, that nothing comes of it.
Stolypin’s agrarian policy 405 is correct from the point of view of Bismarckianism.
But Stolypin him-self “asks” for 20 years to make something “come of it”.
But twenty years, and even a shorter time, is impossible in Russia without 1830-1848-1871 (if in the French style) and 1863-1865 (if in the German style).
It is impossible.
And all these dates (both 1830-1848-1871 and 1863-1865) are a “general-democratic onset”.
No, we cannot “liquidate” the idea of “a general-demo-cratic onset”—that would be a cardinal mistake.
We should recognise the possibility of a “German line”, but we should not forget that so far it does not exist.
It simply does not.
* Constitutional conflict.
—Ed.
We should not link the destinies of the proletarian party with the success or failure of the bourgeois revolution— that is indisputable.
We should organise the work so that, whatever the turn events take, it will be a stable, un-alienable achievement—that is true.
But we are obliged to do our duty as leaders of a democratic, “general-demo-cratic”, movement right to the end, until the Russian 1871, until the complete turn of the peasantry to the side of an Ordnungspartei.
* And such a turn, as far as Russia is con-cerned, is still a long way off! We cannot deny the pos-sibility of a “German”, that is to say, a “rotten”, solution of “general-democratic” problems, but we are obliged to do everything, we are obliged to work long and hard in order that this solution will be not “rotten”, not German, but French, i.
e.
, that of the 1830-1848-1871 type, and not of the 1863-65 type (merely a “constitutional” crisis).
There is no guarantee that our 1863-65 will turn out to be “rotten” or successful, but it is our business, the business of the working-class party, to do everything to make the “rotten” develop into the successful, to make the German Verfass-ungsstreit develop into a real French scrimmage.
There are no historical laws to prevent a rotten crisis from turn-ing into a real scrimmage.
There are no such laws.
Every-thing depends on the circumstances, on the mass of poor peas-ants (whom Stolypin has suppressed but not satisfied), on the strength of the workers’ party, on the conditions, fric-tion and conflicts between Guchkov and the “spheres”, etc.
, etc.
We should see to it that we are stronger (and by the time of our 1863-1865 we shall be stronger than the Germans were then), and that the peasants then do what we tell them, and not what the liberals tell them.
Only the strug-gle will decide how far this will be achieved.
We shall demand everything in the sense of a “general-democratic onset”: if successful we shall gain everything, if unsuccess-ful—a part; but, in going into battle, we must not confine ourselves to demanding a part.
To build in a new way, to organise in a new way, to enter the crisis in a new way— such is the crucial feature of the moment, but all the old * Party of order.

slogans, the demand for “everything”, must be maintained, developed and strengthened.
All the very, very best.

Petersburg First published in 1 9 2 2 Printed from the typewritten copy found in police recordQQP 186 DRAFT OF A LETTER TO THE “TRUSTEES” 406 Letter to the German Trio To explain the at first glance strange proposal and re-quest which we and the C.
C.
are addressing to you, we must clarify the situation in our Party.
To understand this situation, one must have a clear idea, firstly, of the violent nature of the counter-revolution and the appalling chaos in the Social-Democratic organisa-tion and Social-Democratic work; and, secondly, of the basic ideological and political trends in our Party.
On the first question, it is sufficient to note the tremen-dous decline among the organisations everywhere, almost their cessation in many localities.
The wholesale flight of the intelligentsia.
All that is left are workers’ circles and isolated individuals.
The young, inexperienced worker is making his way forward with difficulty.
On the second question.
There were two trends among the Social-Democrats in the revolution (and two factions, tatsächlich Spaltung * ): the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.
Stockholm 1906 and London 1907.
407 An opportunist and a revolutionary wing.
The 1907-08 break-down gave rise (α ) among the Men-sheviks—to liquidationism (definition), (β ) among the Bol-sheviks—to otzovism (and ultimatumism).
Definition.
(α) Beginning with March 1908, the Mensheviks took absolutely no part in the central work of the Party and even tried to disrupt it (August 1908).
Abroad they pre-dominate (students, immature bourgeois intellectuals, etc.
).
A wide-open split abroad (thanks to the Mensheviks) and * An actual split.
—Ed.
their complete non-participation in Party work, plus a struggle against the Party.
The conference of December 1908 brands this.
408 (β) Otzovism-ultimatumism among the Bolsheviks in 1908-09.
The Bolsheviks’ resolute struggle against it and Kaltstellung * of the otzovists and ultimatumists.
Removal.
Chaos in Russia increasing.
Plekhanov’s statement, August 1909 (“What Can We Do for You?” 4 0 9 , the liquidationism of Golos; liquidationism declared to be petty-bourgeois opportunism; acknowledge-ment of the crisis in the Party [frightful disease]; resig-nation from the editorial board of the Social Movement which had taken refuge in a bürgerlich-liberalen Verlag ** ).
The significance of Plekhanov’s statement= a feeble echo, the confirmation by a factional enemy of the Bolsheviks of all their accusations.
The gravitation of the Mensheviks in Russia towards the Party (particularly in the case of workers: St.
Peters-burg, Moscow).
Experience of Party unity on this basis, on the recogni-tion of the struggle on two fronts; against liquidationism and against otzovism-ultimatumism.
Conditions for unity on our part: unconditional recogni-tion of the struggle against liquidationism (half-measure of the C.
C.
: a personal concession); cessation of factional struggle (= of the split abroad in particular) and loyal subordination to the majority of the Party (Bolsheviks& Poles in particular), which extricated the Party from the 1907-09 crisis and set it on the path of a resolute struggle on two fronts.
Conditions of the Mensheviks: concealment of a clear definition of liquidationism (half-measure in the unani-mous resolution) and equality on the editorial board of the Central Organ (virtually the leading Party body in view of the extreme weakness and instability of the C.
C.
in Russia).
In the C.
C.
an extremely unstable compromise is effected: 1) a unanimous resolution deleting the name liquidation-* Removal.

** Bourgeois-liberal publishing house.
—Ed.
ism 4 1 0 ; 2) three and two in the C.
O.
, in circumstances of the Menshevik declaration about “mechanical suppression”, “a state of siege”, etc.
; 3) refusal of the Mensheviks resolute-ly, clearly and irrevocably to renounce their factional newspaper and factional organisation, and to recognise loyal subordination to the Majority.
Hence our fears.
Having dissolved the Bolshevik faction and handed over the money to the C.
C.
(actually 5 powers in circumstances of an accidental and wavering majority, marred by otzovism-ultimatumism), we fear (have every ground for fearing) a split of the Mensheviks abroad and their dragging in of liquidationism (in the shape of equal-ity on the editorial board).
We are convinced that in view of attempts at a split, organised from abroad by the Mensheviks, the C.
C.
(i.
e.
, the Bolsheviks & the nationals) will not be strong enough to combat liquidationism, and we will have to resume the factional struggle, reply to the split by a split.
The experience of the “truce”: the Bolsheviks have dis-armed.
The experience of the “Party way of life”.
The conditions to be put to the Mensheviks: (α) complete disarmament—cessation of the factional newspaper, the factional funds, the factional split abroad; (β ) loyal imple-mentation of the resolution on the struggle against liquidat-ionism; (γ) loyal subordination to the majority in the C.
O.
; (δ) loyal assistance to the C.
C.
in Russia.
Si non—non! The flirting of the Mensheviks with the otzovists-ultima-tumists.
Trotsky’s impotence and connivance in regard to the liquidators.

VILONOV March 27, 1910 Dear Comrade Mikhail, How is your health? Are you getting better? Write about this, tell us whether you are putting on weight and how much.
The fog of conciliatory unity among us is beginning to disperse.
I am sending you a reprint from No.
12 of So-tsial-Demokrat.
411 You will see from it that there has been an all-out fight with the Golos group.
The question now boils down to whether there are any Plekhanovites in exist-ence, whether there are any pro-Party Mensheviks in existence, or whether all the Mensheviks are Golos support-ers, and Plekhanov is simply an isolated individual.
Intensified agitation has to be carried on for the with-drawal of the Plekhanovites from the Golos groups, for the replacement of the Golos supporter in the Bureau of the C.
C.
Abroad by a Plekhanovite and so on—and by means of such agitation to verify in practice whether Party unity will result at least in our unity with the Plekhanovites or whether nothing at all will come of it.
The group of Bolsheviks here is about to start such agi-tation; when it does, you will receive news of it.
The Vperyodists 412 are holding a sort of meeting here; it is said that Bogdanov and Stanislav have arrived.
What they intend to do is not known.
They are behaving stupidly and the Central Organ will, probably, have to fight them as well, after their first press statement.
There was a letter from Russia saying that Alexinsky wrote to the Moscow Vperyod group about their plan to organise a school of their own for 50 people (they have raised money, then?)but that the Vperyod people in Moscow are said to be in-clined towards a general party school.
There is no correspondence with Gorky.
It is rumoured that he has become disillusioned with Bogdanov and has realised the falsity of the latter’s behaviour.
Have you any news from Capri? There are few forces in Russia.
Ah, if only we could send from here a good Party worker to the C.
C.
or for convening a conference! But here everyone is a “has-been”.
Keep well and write, All the best.

11, about the need for a close and sincere alignment of all genuinely Social-Democratic elements in the struggle against liquida-tionism and otzovism, I should very much like to have a talk with you personally about the present state of affairs in the Party.
If you, too, find this useful and if your health permits, be so kind as to write me (or wire) a few words as to when you could meet me in San Remo.
I am ready to make the journey for that purpose.

VILONOV April 7, 1910 Dear Comrade M.
, I am sending you the resolution of our local Plekhanovites, or, rather, the pro-Party Mensheviks.
414 If it is true that with you in Davos the pro-Party elements preponderate among the Mensheviks, it is extremely important that they should respond immediately, rally together one way or another and come out openly.
Obviously, Bolsheviks should be very cautious in giving such advice to Mensheviks, for even among the Plekhanovites there is no accusation more terrible, horrible and intolerable than that of “aiding the Bolsheviks” or of working “for the Bolsheviks”, etc.
In the present confused situation there are, in my opin-ion, only two ways out: either back to our own Bolshevik faction, or a determined fight together with the Plekhano-vites for the Party and against the Golos people.
The second alternative is the more desirable, but it does not depend on us.
So long as it is possible, we shall do all we can for the second way out.
Only after trying out all possibilities, all means for the second way out, shall we return to the first one.
I am very glad that your acquaintance with pragmatism has begun to turn you away from Machism.
In Russia now they are intensively translating all this “latest” philosoph-ical muck: Petzoldt and Co.
, the pragmatists, etc.
This is good: when our people in Russia, especially the Russian workers, see the teachers of our Bogdanov and Co.
, au naturel—they will quickly turn away from both teachers and pupils.
To regard truth as an instrument of cognition means, in effect, to go over to agnosticism, i.
e.
, to abandon materi-alism.
In this and in everything fundamental, the prag-matists, Machists, empirio-monists are birds of a feather.
With warm greetings and wishing you a speedy and last-ing recovery.

April 11, 1910 Dear A.
M.

F.
sent through M.
S.
Botkina until today.
Before I forget: you can write to me at my private address (Oulianoff, 4, Rue Marie Rose, 4, Paris, XIV) and at the address of the Party—in which case it is safer to use two envelopes, the inner one marked: for Lenin, private (110, Avenue d’Orléans, Mr.
Kotliarenko, Paris, XIV).
I shall try and send you tomorrow the publications you ask for.
Did I criticise you, and where? It must have been in Diskussionny Listok No.
1 * (published as a supplement to the C.
O.
).
415 I am sending you a copy.
If this is not what your informants had in mind, then I don’t remember any-thing else at the moment.
I wrote nothing else during that period.
Now about unity.
You ask: is this a fact or an anecdote? I shall have to go back a long way to tell you about this, for there is something both “anecdotal” (rather trivial) about this fact, and something serious, in my view.
There have been deep and serious factors leading to Party unity: in the ideological field—the need to purge Social-Democracy from liquidationism and otzovism; in the prac-tical field—the terribly difficult plight of the Party and of all Social-Democratic work, and the coming to maturity of a new type of Social-Democratic worker.
* See “Notes of a Publicist”, Section One, The “Platform” of the Adherents and Defenders of Otzovism (present edition, Vol.
16).
—Ed.
At the C.
C.
plenum (the “long plenum”—three weeks of agony, all nerves were on edge, the devil to pay!) to these serious and deep-lying factors, which were by no means generally recognised, were added minor, petty factors— a mood of “conciliation in general” (without any clear idea with whom, for what, and how); hatred of the Bolshevik Centre for its implacable ideological struggle; squabbling on the part of the Mensheviks, who were spoiling for a fight, and as a result—an infant covered with blisters.
And so we have to suffer.
Either—at best—we cut open the blisters, let out the pus, and cure and rear the infant.
Or, at worst—the infant dies.
Then we shall be childless for a while (that is, we shall re-establish the Bolshevik faction) and then give birth to a more healthy infant.
Among the Mensheviks, those working for serious unity are the Plekhanovites (not quite consciously, rather slowly and waveringly, but they are nevertheless working for it, and, what is most important, they cannot help working for it), the pro-Party-ists and the workers.
The Golos people, however, are fencing, causing confusion and making mischief.
They are building up a strong, legal, opportunist centre in Russia (Potresov & Co.
in the press: see Nasha Zarya 416 No.
2—what a scoundrel this Potresov is!—and Mikhail, Roman, Yury& the sixteen authors of the “Open Letter” 417 in No.
19/20 of Golos—in practical, organisa-tional work).
The C.
C.
plenum wanted to unite everyone.
Now the Golos people drop out.
This abscess must be removed.
It can-not be done without squabbling, rows, nervous strain, mud and “scum”.
We are just now in the thick of this squabbling.
Either the C.
C.
in Russia lops off the Golos supporters by removing them from important bodies (such as the Central Organ, etc.
)—or our faction will have to be re-established.
In No.
11 of Dnevnik, Plekhanov has given an appraisal of the plenum which clearly shows that the sincere and serious desire to fight opportunism now prevails with him over the minor, petty desire to utilise the Golos opportun-ists against the Bolsheviks.
Here, too, things take a com-plex and protracted course, but the Mensheviks’ legalistic, liquidationist centre that has been built up in Russia will,inevitably lead to serious Social-Democrats turning away from them.
Now about the Vperyodists.
At one time it seemed to me that within this group, too, there were two trends: towards the Party and Marxism, towards renouncing Machism and otzovism, and the opposite.
As far as the first trend is concerned, Party unity would enable the patent absurdities of otzovism, etc.
, to be corrected in a conve-nient and unembarrassing Party way.
But, apparently, the second trend is getting the upper hand among them.
Alexinsky (a mere babe-in-arms in politics, but one who has turned angry and is committing one stupidity after another) kicked up a row and resigned from both the edito-rial board of Diskussionny Listok and from the Party’s School Committee.
418 They will probably organise a school of their own, again a factional one, again on the side.
If they do, we shall fight again and win the workers away from them.
And so it works out, that in the matter of unity the “anec-dotic” predominates at the present time, is brought into high focus, gives occasion for sniggering and sneering, etc.
It is said that the Socialist-Revolutionary Chernov has even written a farce about unity among the Social-Demo-crats entitled “A Storm in a Tea-cup”, and that this farce will be performed here in a day or two before one of the groups of the emigrant colony, who are addicted to sensa-tionalism.
It is sickening to be stuck in the midst of this “anecdotic” situation, this squabbling and row-making, nervous strain and “scum”; to observe all this is also sickening.
But one should not allow oneself to succumb to the mood.
Life in exile is now a hundred times harder than it was before the revolution.
Life in exile and squabbling are inseparable.
But the squabbling will pass away; nine-tenths of it remains abroad; it is an accessory feature.
The development of the Party, the development of the Social-Democratic movement goes forward despite all the devilish difficulties of the present situation.
The purging of the Social-Demo-cratic Party from its dangerous “deviations”, from liquida-tionism and otzovism goes forward steadfastly; within the framework of unity it has progressed considerably fartherthan before.
As a matter of fact, we had finished with ot-zovism ideologically before the plenum.
We had not fin-ished with liquidationism at that time; the Mensheviks succeeded temporarily in hiding the snake, but now it has been dragged out into broad daylight, now everyone sees it, now we shall kill it! And this purging is by no means only an “ideological” task, a labour of armchair workers as that fool (or rogue) Potresov thinks, who stands up for the Machists the way the Mensheviks at the plenum stood up for the Vperyodists.
No, this purge is inseparably bound up with the mass work-ing-class movement, which learns how to organise Social-Democratic work in the present difficult period, learns pre-cisely by rejection, finds the right path by rejecting liquida-tionism and otzovism.
Only that windbag Trotsky imagines that this rejection can be avoided, that it is super-fluous, that it does not concern the workers, that the issues of liquidationism and otzovism have been posed not by life itself, but by the wicked polemicists.
I can imagine how distressing the sight of this painful growth of the new Social-Democratic movement must be to those who have not seen and lived through its painful growth in the late eighties and early nineties.
At that time such Social-Democrats were to be counted by the score, if not in individuals.
Now there are hundreds and thou-sands of them.
Hence the crisis and crises.
And the Social-Democratic movement as a whole is coping with them open-ly and will overcome them honestly.
All the very best.

SEMASHKO 419 October 4, 1910 Dear N.
A.
, We must meet as soon as possible to talk about the speed-iest convocation of a meeting of Bolsheviks (anti-Vperyod-ists).
Yesterday Mark& Lozovsky& Lyova departed with a protest against a factional newspaper.
420 The funny fel-ows! I am glad that the muddlers are out of it, but we must speedily ascertain the attitude of the remaining peo-ple.
If possible come out as quickly as you can and take steps for an early meeting.
Yours, Lenin Sent from Paris to Chatillon (France) First published in 1 9 3 0 Printed from the original192 TO JULIAN MARCHLEWSKI 421 October, 7, 1910 Dear Comrade, I received the letter from you and Wurm and your ar-ticle late yesterday evening.
In accordance with your and Kautsky’s request, lasse ich es bei Ihrem Artikel bewenden.
* I have already written about half of a long article against both Martov and Trotsky.
** I shall have to leave it and start on an article against Trotsky.
Since you meet Kautsky, please tell him that I am taking care of the reply to Trotsky.
If the Germans are so afraid of a polemic, I don’t think it matters much whether the reply comes a week earlier or a week later? What a pity that even Kautsky and Wurm do not see how disgusting and mean such articles as those of Martov and Trotsky are.
I shall try to write at least a private let-ter to Kautsky to clarify the matter.
It is really a down-right scandal that Martov and Trotsky lie with impunity and write scurrilous lampoons in the guise of “scientific” articles! By the way, could you help me to clear up two practical questions.
First: could a translator from Russian into Ger-man be found in Berlin (for articles for Neue Zeit)? Or is this unreliable and expensive, so that it would be better to look for someone here? I shall look out for someone here in any case, but I should like to know your opinion, as you have considerable experience in this respect.
* I shall confine myself to your article.
—Ed.
** Reference is to “ The Historical Meaning of the Inner-Party Struggle in Russia” (see present edition, Vol.
16).
—Ed.
Second: what if I were to write a pamphlet (of a size à la Cherevanin: Das Proletariat in der russischen Revolution) on the subject of the Russian revolution, its lessons, class struggle, etc.
Could a German party publisher be found or not? Do the Germans pay for such things, or must payment be looked for only from the Russians, while the Germans are served nebenbei? In connection with the reply to Martov, I have dug into some very interesting strike statistics of 1905-08 and should very much like to analyse them.
It is a subject more suitable for a book or pamphlet than for an article.
* But the Germans are disgracefully “unconscious” in questions concerning the appraisal of the Russian revolution! I enclose a brief enumeration of what it is desirable to add against Martov.
If you include even a part of it in your article, it would be very good.
422 Beste Grüsse.
Yours, Lenin Here, in my opinion, are the chief (not all, by far) points of Martov’s lies and falsehood which it is desirable to point out (if not in full, at least in part): In saying that Comrade Radek is misquoting, Comrade Martov casts suspicion without giving proof.
We, however, have full proof that Martov quotes falsely.
“So far we have been speaking French” (Die Neue Zeit, 1910), Martov quotes Lenin.
The quotation is distorted.
Lenin said: “During the revolution we learned to ‘speak French’ ” (Proletary No.
46) ** .
By distorting the quotation, Martov contrives to conceal the fact that he (like all opportunists) calls on the workers to unlearn the methods of revolutionary struggle.
“To speak French”—“richtiger gesagt: blanquistisch ” , *** is Martov’s emendation.
We thank him for his frankness.
To call the participation of the French proletariat in the French revolutions “Blanquism” is precisely the “essence” of the views of Martov and Quessel.
423 * See “Strike Statistics in Russia” (present edition, Vol.
16).

15, p.

*** “Or rather: in the Blanqui manner”.
—Ed.
“In ganz Westeuropa,” writes Martov, “betrachtet man die Bauernmassen in dem Masse für bündnisfähig, als sie die schweren Folgen der kapitalistischen Umwälzung der Landwirtschaft zu spüren bekommen.
.
.
; für Russland malte man sich ein Bild aus, wie mit dem Proletariat sich die 100 Millionen Bauern vereinigen.
.
.
, die noch nicht von der kapi-talistischen Bourgeoisie in die Schule genommen worden sind” (Neue Zeit, Seite 909).
Das ist eben russisches Quessel-tum!* The Russian Quessel forgot to mention that in the agrar-ian programme of the Russian Social-Democrats (adopted in Stockholm, 1906, when the Mensheviks had a majority!) it is stated “support for the revolutionary actions of the peas-antry to the extent of confiscation of the landed estates”.
Is there anything like this in “Europe”, O Russian Ques-sel? There is not, for in Europe the questions of a bourgeois revolution are no longer revolutionary issues.
The “school of the capitalist bourgeoisie” as far as the Russian peasants are concerned is a school of betrayals and treachery on the part of the liberal bourgeoisie (which has been betraying the peasants to the landowners and absolutism), and only extreme opportunists are capable of defending such a school.
In scoffing at the “union with the proletariat of 100 mil-lion peasants”, Martov is scoffing at the whole revolution, which has demonstrated such a union in practice both in the arena of the uprising (October, November-December, 1905) and in the arena of both Dumas (1906-1907).
Martov vacillates helplessly between the liberals (they are against “confiscation of the landed estates”, against “revolutionary actions of the peasantry”) and the Social-Democrats, who so far have by no means withdrawn their support of the peasant uprising or their statement to this effect contained in their programme.
* “In the whole of Western Europe the peasant masses are con-sidered suitable for alliance to tho extent that they come to expe-rience the painful results of the capitalist revolution in agriculture.
.
.
; for Russia a picture has been drawn of the union with the proletariat of 100 million peasants .
.
.
who have not yet been through the school of the capitalist bourgeoisie” (Neue Zeit, p.
909).
That precisely is Russian Quesselism!—Ed.
Martov believes that during the years of revolution (1905-07) it was not the question of a republic, but “die Frage der Unabhängigkeit der Volksvertretung” (S.
918) * that was on the order of the day.
Independence from whom? From the monarchy which had carried out Staatsstreiche? ** The Russian opportunists forget at least the connection be-tween the agrarian and the political revolution (is it pos-sible to fight for the confiscation of the landed estates without fighting for a republic?); they forget that the era of Staatsstreiche, der Aufstände, der Niederwerfungsstreiks, *** by virtue of its objective conditions and not of our will, puts the question of a republic on the order of the day.
The “republic” as a slogan of the day in 1905= “romanti-cism”; “independence” (from the monarchy which carries out Staatsstreiche and wages den Bürgerkrieg) **** = Real-politik, is not that so, O Russian Quessel? Apropos.
Rosa Luxemburg argued with Kautsky as to whether in Germany the moment had arrived for Niederwer-fungsstrategie, ***** and Kautsky plainly and bluntly stated that he considered this moment was unavoidable and im-minent but had not yet arrived.
But Martov, “deepening (verballhornend 1 ) Kautsky, denies the applicability of the Niederwerfungsstrategie to the year 1905 in Russia! Martov finds that the uprising in December 1905 was evoked “künstlich” 2 (Neue Zeit, S.
913).
Die Leute, welche so glauben, können nur künstlich zur Sozialdemokratie ge-rechnet werden.
Natürlich sind sie Nationalliberale.

909) 4 in the revolution.

to deny the indisputable historical fact that in 1905 the Rus-sian proletariat actually played the part of “der ausschlag-gebenden Macht”.
And when a theory which denies the “hegemony of the proletariat in the Russian revolution” gained the upper hand in the five-volume Social Movement (edited by Martov and Potresov), Plekhanov resigned from the editorial board and declared the Social Movement a work of liquidators.
Martov now represents not Menshevism as a whole but only that kind of Menshevism which Plekhanov, who has remained a Menshevik, has repudiated and which he has called opportunism.
Martov contraposes the Russian boycott of 1906 to the anarchists’ defence of boycott (“political abstention”) “in ganz Westeuropa”.
We have already spoken about the boy-cott of 1906 (you have already dealt with this).
But speak-ing of boycott in general, why did Martov forget the chief application of a boycott in the Russian revolution, the boy-cott of the Bulygin Duma (the law of August 6, 1905)? Against this boycott were all the liberals, even those of the Left (Osvobozhdeniye League), in favour of it were the Bolshevik Social-Democrats.
Is it because this boycott was victorious that Martov is silent about it? Is it because this boycott was the slogan of a victorious Niederwerfungsstrategie? All the Mensheviks (especially in Nasha Zarya, Vozrozh-deniye and Zhizn 424 ) seized on Rosa Luxemburg’s dispute with Kautsky in order to declare K.
Kautsky a “Menshe-vik”.
Martov is trying his hardest, by means of kleinliche und miserable Diplomatie, to deepen the gulf between Rosa Luxemburg and K.
Kautsky.
These elende * devices cannot succeed.
Revolutionary Social-Democrats may argue about the timing of Niederwerfungsstrategie in Germany, but not of its appropriateness in Russia in 1905.
It has never oc-curred to Kautsky to deny its appropriateness for Russia in 1905.
Only liberals and German and Russian Quessels can deny that! Well then, will not the upshot of the question of the mass strike in Magdeburg (the acceptance of Rosa’s resolution and her withdrawal of the second part) make for peace be-* Pitiful.

SHKLOVSKY 426 Dear Comrade, Many thanks for the letter and news of the Plekhanovite agitation.
All such information, which gives us an accurate idea of the moods prevailing among the Social-Democrats abroad, is now extremely valuable to us.
I too am thinking of going on a lecture tour in Switzerland (Geneva, Lausanne, Berne, Zurich 4 2 7 ).
I don’t know whether the journey will be worth it.
Regarding a bloc with Plekhanov, I think you are quite right that we should be in favour of it.
Since 1909 I have been wholly in favour of a rapprochement with the Plekhano-vites.
And even more so now.
We can and should build the Party only with the Plekhanovites—the Vperyod and Golos people should have been given up as hopeless long ago.
It is a mistake to think that the Plekhanovites are weak, mere “ciphers” (as is sometimes said), etc.
That is an impression existing abroad.
I am deeply convinced that nine-tenths of the Menshevik workers in Russia are Plekhanovites.
The whole history of Menshevism in the revolution vouches for the fact that Plekhanovism is the best (and therefore the most viable) product of the proletarian stream of Mensheviks.
In Copenhagen, Plekhanov and I talked about publishing a popular newspaper.
It is essential.
(Trotsky has clearly turned to the liquidators, to support of the Golos group, to disruption of the Party bloc between the Bolsheviks and Plekhanovites.
) Plekhanov and I fully agree that nothing can be done with Trotsky.
We shall either establish a popu-lar newspaper under the C.
O.
, or separately by the group of Bolsheviks.
Plekhanov has promised to contribute.
Money will be needed—we have exceedingly little.
I am hopingfor every assistance from you.
We are struggling hard to establish a periodical in Russia (à la Vozrozhdeniye or Zhizn).
We can’t get the thing going, there is no secretary, no one through whom to arrange things—our people are continu-ally being arrested, worse luck! Yet a periodical is essen-tial.
428 All the best.

M.
, There has been no news from you and M.
F.
for a very long time.
I have been looking forward eagerly to news from Capri.
What’s wrong? Surely you don’t keep count of letters as some people are said to keep count of visits.
Everything here is as of old.
A host of trivial affairs and all kinds of trouble connected with the struggle of the various “dominions” inside the Party.
Brrr! .
.
.
It must be nice on Capri.
.
.
.
By way of relaxation from the squabbling we have taken up the old plan of publishing Rabochaya Gazeta.
With dif-ficulty we raised 400 francs.
Yesterday No.
1 came out at last.
I am sending you a copy together with a leaflet and a subscription list.
429 Members of the Capri-Neapolitan colony who sympathise with such an enterprise (and with the “rapprochement” between the Bolsheviks and Plekha-nov) are invited to afford every assistance.
Rabochaya Gazeta is necessary, but we can’t make a go of it with Trotsky, who is intriguing in favour of the liquidators and the otzo-vists and Vperyod supporters.
Already in Copenhagen Ple-khanov and I protested vigorously against Trotsky’s despic-able article in Vorwärts.
And what a disgusting article he has published in Neue Zeit, too, on the historical signifi-cance of the struggle among the Russian Social-Democrats 430! And Lunacharsky’s in the Belgian Le Peuple—have you seen it? We are setting up a small legal periodical to combat Nasha Zarya and Zhizn—this, too, with Plekhanov’s partic-ipation.
We hope to issue No.
1 soon.
431And so we jog along.
Little by little, hard and slowly we are making headway, extricating ourselves from the squab-bles.
What is the news with you? Did you write to Stroyev and what reply did you receive? We wrote a first letter to him to “make contact”; he received it and replied that he did not understand who was writing.
We wrote again.
Not a word.
There’s a terrible shortage of the right people, and the old ones have dispersed.
Arrangements were on the point of completion in St.
Petersburg for putting out a weekly newspaper together with the Duma group (the Mensheviks there fortunately incline not towards the liquidators, but towards Plekhanov), but the matter has been held up again, the devil knows why.
432 Write how you are getting on.
Is your work going well? Has anything come of the journal we talked about in the summer? How are things with Znaniye? 433 I have the right to be cross with M.
F.
She promised to write.
Nothing has come.
She promised to find out about the Paris library on the history of the Russian revolution.
Nothing has come.
That’s bad.
All the best.

Sent from Paris to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 3 0 Printed from the original195 TO MAXIM GORKY November 22, 1910 Dear A.
M.
, I wrote you a few days ago when sending Rabochaya Gazeta, and asked what had come of the journal we talked about in the summer and about which you promised to write to me.
I see in Rech today a notice about Sovremennik, pub-lished “with the closest and exclusive [that is what is print-ed! illiterately, but so much the more pretentiously and significantly] participation of Amfiteatrov” and with you as a regular contributor.
435 What is this? How does it happen? A “large monthly” journal, with sections on “politics, science, history, social life”—why, this is something quite different from sympo-sia aiming at a concentration of the best forces of belles-lettres.
Such a journal should either have a perfectly defi-nite, serious and consistent trend, or it will inevitably dis-grace itself and those taking part in it.
Vestnik Yevropy 436 has a trend—a poor, watery, worthless trend—but one which serves a definite element, certain sections of the bourgeoisie, and which also unites definite circles of the professorate and officialdom, and the so-called intelligentsia from among the “respectable” (or rather, would-be respectable) liberals.
Russkaya Mysl 437 has a trend, an odious trend, but one which performs a very good service for the counter-revolu-tionary liberal bourgeoisie.
Russkoye Bogatsvo 438 has a trend—a Narodnik, Narodnik-Cadet trend—but one which has kept its line for scores of years, and which serves defi-nite sections of the population.
Sovremenny Mir 439 has a trend—often Menshevik-Cadet trend (at present with a lean-ing towards pro-Party Menshevism)—but a trend.
A journal without a trend is an absurdity, a ridiculous, scandalous and harmful thing.
And what sort of trend can there be withthe “exclusive participation” of Amfiteatrov? One cannot expect G.
Lopatin to provide a trend, and if the talk (said also to have got into the newspapers) is true about Kacho-rovsky’s participation, than that is a “trend”, but a trend of the blockheads, a S.
R.
trend.
During our talk in the summer when I told you that I had all but written you a disappointed letter about Con-fessions but did not send it because of the split with the Machists which had begun at that time, you replied: “it’s a pity you did not send it”.
Then you went on to reproach me for not going to the Capri school, 440 and you said that, if matters had taken a different course, the breakaway of the Machists and otzovists might have cost you less nervous strain, less waste of energy.
Recalling these talks, I have now decided to write to you without putting it off and without waiting for any verification, while the impression the news has made is still fresh.
I think that a political and economic monthly with the exclusive participation of Amfiteatrov is something many times worse than a special Machist-otzovist faction.
What was and still is bad about this faction is that the ideological trend deviated and still deviates from Marxism, from So-cial-Democracy, without, however, going so far as a break with Marxism, and only creating confusion.
Amfiteatrov’s journal (his Krasnoye Znamya 441 did well to die when it did!) is a political act, a political enterprise in which there is not even a realisation that a general “left-ism” is not enough for a policy, that after 1905 to talk se-riously about politics without making clear one’s attitude towards Marxism and Social-Democracy is out of the ques-tion, impossible, inconceivable.
Things are turning out bad.
It’s saddening.

POLETAYEV 442 I have received your two letters, which surprised me.
What could be easier, it would seem, than to write and tell us simply and clearly what is the matter? We are still in the dark.
It should not be difficult to find a person to write sensibly, clearly and frankly at least once a week.
Your attempt to detach the liquidators from liquida-tionism is unfortunate to a degree.
We have never approved this distinction.
Only sophists draw it.
We earnestly re-quest you not to believe the sophists and not to make this distinction.
One can reconcile oneself to anything but the liquidators, and if you do not want the work to be ruined, keep them out of it.
With great difficulty we obtained from a publisher here a further thousand rubles and will send them to you tomor-row.
If this publisher approaches you again with ques-tions, advice, conditions, and so on—don’t answer at all, or answer as we once advised.
Concerning the little magazine, we have had nothing from anyone.
So we repeat once more our insistent request: we have obtained for you what you require, see that you do not let us down, keep out the liquidators (there is no such thing as liquidationism without liquidators.
And who could have played such a cruel joke on you by assuring you of a distinc-tion between liquidationism and the liquidators?) and, further, see to it that we get a sensible, clear, frank and de-tailed letter every week.
Surely these two requests are not difficult, not too much; we cannot manage without it.
Yours.

Petersburg First published in 1 9 3 3 Printed from the typewritten copy found in police recordQQQ 197 TO MAXIM GORKY January 3, 1911 Dear A.
M.
, I have long been intending to reply to your letter but in-tensification of the squabbling * here (a hundred thousand devils take it!) distracted me.
But I should like to have a chat with you.
First of all, before I forget: Tria has been arrested together with Jordania and Ramishvili.
It is reported as being true.
A pity, for he is a good chap.
A revolutionary.
Regarding Sovremennik.
In Rech today I read the contents of the first issue and I am cursing and swearing.
Vodovozov on Muromtsev .
.
.
Kolosov on Mikhailovsky, Lopatin “Not ours”, etc.
You can’t help swearing.
And here are you, teasing as it were: “realism, democracy, activity”.
Do you think these are good words? They are bad words, used by all the bourgeois tricksters in the world, from the Cadets and S.
R.
s in our country to Briand or Millerand here, Lloyd George in Britain, etc.
The words are bad, turgid, and they carry a S.
R.
-Cadet message.
It’s not good.
As regards Tolstoy, I fully share your opinion that hyp-ocrites and rogues will make a saint of him.
Plekhanov, too, was infuriated by all the lying and sycophancy around Tolstoy, and in here we see eye to eye.
He criticises Nasha Zarya for it in the C.
O.
(the next issue), 443 and I am doing so in Mysl ** (No.
1 arrived today.
Congratulate us on our own little journal in Moscow, a Marxist one.
This has been a happy day for us).
Zvezda No.
1 (it appeared on December * That rascal Trotsky is uniting the Golosists and Vperyodists against us.
It is war! ** See “Hero’s of ‘Reservation’ ” (present edition, Vol.
16).
—Ed.
16 in St.
Petersburg) also contains a good article by Ple-khanov with a trivial comment, for which we have already scolded the editors.
It was probably concocted by that ninny Yordansky, together with Bonch! But how come Sovre-mennik to combat the “legend about Tolstoy and his reli-gion”.
Is it Vodovozov with Lopatin? You must be joking That they have started hitting out at the students is; in my opinion, comforting, but Tolstoy must not be allowed to get away with either “passivism” or anarchism or Na-rodism or religion.
As regards quixotism in the international policy of So-cial-Democracy, I think, you are wrong.
It is the revision-ists who have long been asserting that colonial policy is progressive, that it implants capitalism and that therefore it is senseless to “accuse it of greed and cruelty”, for “without these qualities” capitalism is “hamstrung”.
It would be quixotism and whining if Social-Democrats were to tell the workers that there could be salvation some-where apart from the development of capitalism, not through the development of capitalism.
But we do not say this.
We say: capital devours you, will devour the Per-sians, will devour everyone and go on devouring until you overthrow it.
That is the truth.
And we do not forget to add: except through the growth of capitalism there is no guarantee of victory over it.
Marxists do not defend a single reactionary measure such as banning trusts, restricting trade, etc.
But to each his own.
Let Khomyakov and Co.
build railways across Persia, let them send Lyakhovs, 444 but the job of the Marx-ists is to expose them to the workers.
If it devours, say the Marxists, if it strangles, fight back.
Resistance to colonial policy and international plunder by means of organising the proletariat, by means of defend-ing freedom for the proletarian struggle, does not retard the development of capitalism but accelerates it, forcing it to resort to more civilised, technically higher methods of capitalism.
There is capitalism and capitalism.
There is Black-Hundred-Octobrist 445 capitalism and Narodnik (“realistic, democratic”, full of “activity”) capitalism.
The more we expose capitalism before the workers for its “greed and cruelty” the more difficult is it for capitalismof the first order to persist, the more surely is it bound to pass into capitalism of the second order.
And this just suits us, this just suits the proletariat.
You think I have fallen into a contradiction? In the be-ginning of the letter I considered the words “realism, de-mocracy, activity” bad words, and now I find them good? There is no contradiction here; what is bad for the proletar-iat is good for the bourgeois.
The Germans have an exemplary journal of the opportun-ists: Sozialistische Monatshefte.
There gentlemen like Schippel and Bernstein have long been attacking the in-ternational policy of the revolutionary Social-Democrats by raising an outcry that this policy resembles the “lamen-tations of compassionate” people.
That, brother, is a trick of opportunist swindlers.
Ask for this journal to be sent to you from Naples and have their articles translated if you are interested in international politics.
You probably have such opportunists in Italy too, only there are no Marx-ists in Italy, that’s what makes her so nasty.
The international proletariat is pressing capitalism in two ways: by converting Octobrist capitalism into demo-cratic capitalism and, because it drives Octobrist capitalism away from itself, by transplanting this capitalism to the savages.
This, however, enlarges the basis of capitalism and brings its death nearer.
There is practically no Octobrist capitalism left in Western Europe; practically all capital-ism is democratic.
Octobrist capitalism has gone from Brit-ain and France to Russia and Asia.
The Russian revolu-tion and the revolutions in Asia= the struggle for ousting Octobrist capitalism and replacing it by democratic capi-talism.
And democratic capitalism= the last of its kind.
It has no next stage to go on to.
The next stage is its death.
What do you think of Zvezda and Mysl? The former is dull, in my opinion.
But the latter is all ours and I am de-lighted with it.
I’m afraid they’ll soon close it down, though.
I was wondering whether you could arrange for my book on the agrarian question to go to Znaniye.
Talk it over with Pyatnitsky, I just can’t find a publisher, not for love or money.
446 Reading your postscript: “my hands are shaking and freezing” makes me indignant.
What wretched houses youhave on Capri! It’s a disgrace, really! Even we here have central heating; and your “hands are freezing”.
You must revolt.
All the very best.
Yours, Lenin I have received from Bologna an invitation to come to the school there (20 workers).
I have turned it down.
447 I don’t want to have anything to do with the Vperyodists.
We’re trying again to get the workers to come here.
Sent from Paris to the Isle of Capri (Italy) First published in 1 9 2 4 Printed from the original198 TO A.
RYKOV Saturday, February 25, 1911 Dear Vlasov, I have just received your letter and I hasten to reply at once without waiting for Grigory, who forwarded Samo-varov’s letter on to you today.
Nadya is writing today to Lyubich.
What a pity you didn’t think of it before.
Now you must write to him not about preparing to leave, but about immediate departure.
Write to him again, insisting emphatically on immediate depar-ture, otherwise the enemy will have four (the Bundist& the Lett&two Mensheviks) and we’ll have no more than that (three, of whom one is doubtful,&one Pole).
Your letter concerning the declaration grieves me very much, for I see from it how inadequate our agreement still is and hence (to my extreme regret) how “precarious” it is.
Among the changes proposed by you, there are some to which no objections can be made.
These include: dealing with the question of affairs abroad in a special resolution; adding to the declaration a special paragraph on the signific-ance of the Duma and on the fact that those not assisting in the elections to the Fourth Duma are traitors; separating the question of renewing the primary Party cells (although I do not understand why it should be separated and where it should be put.
It must be dealt with, however! But where?).
But you propose many more changes that are unaccept-able and harmful.
(“To recognise that the conference is urgent”? Why try to be cunning? You don’t believe in it yourself! To breed hypocrisy and self-deception—there is nothing more harm-ful than that just now!)“To express satisfaction that otzovism-ultimatumism has in effect disappeared from the political horizon”.
.
.
.
That is untrue.
I have seen workers who support Vperyod, and even Yevgeny in his speeches refutes this untruth.
“To welcome the decision of the Vperyod group to take part in the elections”.
.
.
.
There has been no such decision so far.
And if it does appear tomorrow, it is scandalous “to welcome” the split-ters for doing their duty and to keep silent about the expro funds.
448 You write: “I know of no otzovist or ultimatumist statements of Vperyod after the plenum”.
.
.
.
You ought to know better.
Just look: (1) The leaflet of the Vperyod group after the plenum: sheer abuse of the cen-tral bodies—not a word about renouncing the otzovist-ultimatumist platform.
(2) The symposium No.
1 4 4 9 —dit-to.
Not a single guiding article on the Duma and Duma activities.
(3) Lunacharsky in Le Peuple (it is quoted in the C.
O.
—Lunacharsky was officially delegated by the Vperyod group to the Copenhagen Congress).
(4) The leaflet of the Geneva Vperyod group (it is quoted in part in Golos S.
-D.
), which lines up with Lunacharsky.
Vperyod, after the plenum, was in duty bound to issue a new platform, since the old one (it came out on December 27, 1909, i.
e.
, on the eve of the plenum) is an otzovist-ulti-matumist platform.
Vperyod has not done this! Your basic mistake is that you believe words and close your eyes to deeds.
A lot of “good words” have been told you by various people like Domov or Alexinsky and I don’t know who else, and you believe them.
You write: Vperyod “is on the eve of dissolution or is a possible ally of ours”, it “is freeing itself from the otzovist-ultimatumist plat-form”.
This is untrue.
They are the lying words of swindlers who are ready to promise anything so long as they can disguise the facts, namely, their own special school, their 85,000 rubles of expro money.
What if Domov does move away from Vperyod—Domov is a high school teacher, a philistine, an ignorant old wom-an, and not a politician.
What if Alexinsky has “quar-relled” with Bogdanov and Co,—now, after returning fromBologna, he has quite made it up again and yesterday de-livered a lecture on behalf of the Vperyod group! You put your trust in words and leave yourself helpless in deeds—which means repeating the fatal error of the plenum, an error which has weakened the Party for a year at least.
If you now, a year after the idiotic concili-atory errors of the plenum, repeat these errors, you will completely ruin all prospects of “unity”.
I say this with the fullest conviction, for I know it thoroughly from exper-ience.
Leave it to Samovarov to shout about my having wrecked “unity” (this is the catch-phrase of Trotsky and Yonov!).
Samovarov has to shout this nonsense (which he dares not utter in print and which I have publicly dealt with and refuted in No.
2 of Diskussionny Listok * ), for he is ashamed to admit the mistake the conciliators made at the plenum.
Their mistake was that they almost ruined the prospect of unity with the pro-Party Mensheviks, by believ-ing the words of the anti-Party Golosists and allowing them to consolidate themselves in deeds.
Mind you don’t repeat this mistake! The Vperyodists are very strong.
They have a school= a conference= agents.
We (and the C.
C.
) have not.
They have money—some 80,000 rubles.
You think they will give it to you? Are you really so naïve? And if not, how can you regard as “allies” factionalists who are keeping a factional fund against you! It is the height of naïveté to write: “I do not want to make it difficult for the Vperyod splinter elements to achieve a rapprochement.
” They have achieved a rapprochement with the liquidators, they have organised a school against you, they are pulling the wool over your eyes, saying: we are all right, we are not otzovists, and you believe their words and do not combat their deeds.
It’s the limit, really! You write: “I should not like to have the Vperyodists expelled from the general Party (not factional) organisation abroad.
” Either the one or the other: either you encourage a special * The reference is to “Notes of a Publicist” (see present edition, Vol.
16).
—Ed.
faction and let it keep its money, in which case we shall publish our statement to the C.
C.
(demanding a committee of enquiry) and say: let the Vperyodists help such a C.
C.
, we shall not do so.
Or you condemn the factionalism of the Vperyodists, in which case you have to be consistent.
By condemning in words only, you make yourself ridiculous.
In that case it must be said: so long as the Vperyodists (1) do not publish a new platform, (2) do not make pro-Party statements, (3) do not dissolve their factional school, (4) do not hand over their factional funds to the Party—they remain an anti-Party faction.
If you do not say this, you will lose our co-operation with-out gaining that of the Vperyodists.
Is that good policy? As for the splinter elements (future ones!), do not worry about that.
If we are strong, they will all come to us.
If we are weak, if we believe in words, we shall be laughed at, that’s all.
To find the right form is not so difficult: for exam-ple, after condemning the Vperyod faction, to say that part of the Vperyodist workers stand for elections, for legal op-portunities, for the Party principle, and that you call on such workers, such Vperyodists, to come away from the faction and to the Party, etc.
, etc.
In the resolution on unity abroad it should be clearly specified who the disrupters are: the Golosists and Vperyod-ists must be named, and it must be explained wherein lies their “disruption and anti-Partyism”: not in ideas (argue and write about this in Diskussionny Listok, etc.
) but in the special school, in the special school funds, in the special organ (Golos), in the special collections for Golos, and in the special factional groups (which maintain contacts with Russia against the C.
C.
).
If the Golosists and Vperyodists are not precisely and clearly named, the whole resolution= 0.
In that case you will compel us to come out against this playing at unity.
If you name them precisely and say clearly what their factionalism is, you will immediately and definitely win over the majority of our people abroad (the Bolsheviks& the Plekhanovites& pro-Party workers& the bulk of the groups in the “provinces” and in America, where there are no leaders of Golosism).
If the C.
C.
’s “struggle” against factions consists in its paying court to the anti-Party factions of Golos and Vperyod, in hampering our work (in a Party spirit) by multi-storey formalities (the Pole, a committee, a collegium of people who are not acquainted with the matter, “invitation” of Vperyodists, quarrel with Alexinsky, etc.
, etc.
), then you can count us out.
We have just received a letter from St.
Petersburg.
Sa-movarov has proposed to the Social-Democratic Duma group that it issue an electoral platform! This—to a majority of Mensheviks! (and not a word to us).
If Samovarov wants to carry on in this fashion, I prom-ise you that I shall begin a series of leaflets directly against Samovarov.
If an agreement among us is possible, the Bolsheviks must rally into a trend and work harmoniously (on the basis of the agreement), and not carry on intrigues, nor go over to the Mensheviks.
Write and let me know your opinion as soon as possible.
All the best.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
Have you seen Nikitich? Has he tried to sell the story of Vperyod’s peace-loving nature? He’s a great hand at making promises and throwing dust in people’s eyes.
Sent from Paris to Berlin First published in 1 9 3 1 Printed from the original199 TO MAXIM GORKY May 27, 1911 Dear A.
M.
, A few days ago I received a letter from Poletayev.
He writes, inter alia: “We have received a letter from Gorky.
He is proposing that N.
I.
should come abroad to work out a plan for unity around some organ, and adds that he has spoken to you about this and to the Menshevik M” (Martov, I assume).
Poletayev adds that N.
I.
is hardly suitable for this plan and that if somebody must come, it should be somebody else.
It is hardly likely that Pokrovsky will make the journey.
Reading this in Poletayev’s letter frightened me—no, really.
Our uniting with Mensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless, as I told you here.
If we start arranging a meeting for such a hopeless plan—the result will be nothing but a disgrace (personally I would not go even to a meeting with Martov).
Judging from Poletayev’s letter, the participation of the Duma group is planned.
Is this necessary? If it is a ques-tion of a journal, then the Duma group has nothing to do with it.
If it is a question of a newspaper, it should be borne in mind that we have had plenty of discord as it is with Zvezda: they have no line, they are afraid of going with us, afraid of going with the liquidators, they play hot and cold, they give themselves airs, they vacillate.
Besides, a union of the Plekhanovites&our people&the Duma group threatens to give Plekhanov a preponderance, for Mensheviks predominate in the Duma group.
Is it de-sirable and reasonable to give Plekhanov a preponderance? I very much fear that Yordansky is unsuitable for such plans (for he has “his” own journal and he will either raiseobstacles or try to impose “his” journal, leaving it as his, that is, a semi-liberal organ).
To avoid disappointments and hopeless squabbles, I think we should be very careful as regards “unity”.
Upon my word, we should be not uniting now, but dissociating! If a publisher can be found for a journal or a newspaper, you should conclude an agreement with him off your own bat (or take money from him without an agreement, if pos-sible), but the arrangement of a meeting will only make a mess.
Truly, the result will be a mess.
I am writing to you because I do not want to see you of all people wasting your time, nervous energy, etc.
, on a mess.
I know from my own bitter experience of 1908-11 that it is impossible to “unite” now.
In our Mysl, for example, Plekhanov more than once behaved temperamentally—he was dissatisfied, for example, with my article on strikes and on Potresov, * saying that I was abusing “him”! We managed to smooth things over and for the time being we can and must work with Plekhanov, but formal unions and meetings are premature and could spoil everything.
Don’t hurry with the meeting! It is said positively among us that there exists a govern-ment circular of Stolypin’s for closing down all Social-Democratic publications.
It sounds like the truth.
Before the Fourth Duma they will probably put the screw on ten times tighter.
Legal opportunities will evidently diminish in the im-mediate future.
We must push on with illegal work.

200 TO ANTONIN N:MEC 451 Paris, November 1, 1911 Dear Comrade, You will be doing me a great service if you can help me with advice and action in the following matter.
A number of organisations of our Party intend to call a conference (abroad—of course).
The number of members of the con-ference will be about 20-25.
Is there a possibility of organis-ing this conference in Prague (to last about a week)? 452 The most important thing for us is the possibility of or-ganising it in extreme secrecy.
No person, no organisation, should know about it.
(It is a Social-Democratic conference, hence legal according to European laws, but the majority of the delegates do not have passports and cannot use their own names.
) I earnestly beg you, dear comrade, if it is at all possible, to help us and tell me as quickly as possible the address of a comrade in Prague who (in the event of an affirmative reply) could make all the practical arrangements.
It would be best if this comrade understood Russian—if this is im-possible we can also reach agreement with him in German.
I hope, dear comrade, that you will pardon me for troubl-ing you with this request.
I send you my thanks in an-ticipation.

20 3This refers to the preparations for publishing abroad a non-periodi-cal Miscellany entitled Rabotnik.
It was published in 1896-99 by the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and edited by the Emancipation of Labour group.
The publication was sponsored by Lenin.
In May 1895, during his stay in Switzerland, Lenin made arrangements for its publication with G.
V.
Plekhanov, P.
B.
Axelrod and other members of the Emancipation of Labour group.
On his return to Russia in September 1895 Lenin developed extensive activities aimed at supplying articles and correspondence from Russia for the Miscellany and organising financial support for the publication.
During his trips to Vilna, Moscow and Orekho-vo-Zuyevo Lenin made arrangements with the local Social-Demo-crats for assistance to be rendered this publication.
Altogether 6 issues of Rabotnik in three volumes and 10 issues of Listok Rabotnika were published.

The correspondence from abroad was sent in the binding of a book.
p.
23 7This refers to the illegal printing-press of the young Narodnaya Volya group, organised in January 1895.
Lenin negotiated with this group for the purpose of using the press for the publication of literature for the workers.
In November 1895 Lenin’s pamphlet Explanation of the Law on Fines Imposed on Factory Workers (see present edition, Vol.
2) was handed over to this group for printing.
This is the fourth thing (“one of ours”) which Lenin refers to.
p.
23 8This refers to Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause), which was being prepared by the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emanci-pation of the Working Class.
The first number of this newspaper was compiled and edited by Lenin, who also wrote all the main articles: the editorial “To the Russian Workers”, “What Are Our Ministers Thinking About?”, “Frederick Engels” (see present edi-tion, Vol.
2).
In addition the newspaper contained articles by other members of the St.

24 10Meaning Anna Ilyinichna Ulyanova-Yelizarova, Lenin’s sister.
11This refers to the journal Novoye Slovo in which two articles of Lenin’s were published in 1897: “A Characterisation of Economic Romanticism” and “About a Certain Newspaper Article” (see Vol.
2 of this edition).
Novoye Slovo (New Word)—a scientific, literary and political monthly published in St.

25 13Archiv für soziale Gesetzgebung und Statistik (Archive of Social Legislation and Statistics)—a journal, published from 1888 to 1933 in Berlin—Thüringen—Leipzig.
Lenin here refers to Vol.
XII of this journal published in 1898 and containing an article by an anonymous author (probably P.
B.
Struve) entitled “New Factory Legislation in Russia ” .
p.
25 14Struve, Pyotr Bernhardovich (1870-1944)—a bourgeois economist and publicist.
In the nineties a leading spokesman of “legal Marx-ism”, “supplemented” and criticised the economic and philosophic-al theories of Marx, and tried to adapt Marxism and the working-class movement to the interests of the bourgeoisie; contributor to and editor of the journals Novoye Slovo, Nachalo and Zhizn.
Struve was one of the theoreticians and organisers of the liberal-monarchist Osvobozhdeniye League (1903-05).
With the formation of the Cadet Party in 1905—a member of its Central Committee.
After the October Revolution—a white émigré.
p.
25 15Disciples—followers of Marx and Engels.
This term was used in the nineties as a legal designation for Marxists.
p.
25 16Russkoye Bogatstvo (Russian Wealth)—a monthly journal published from 1876 to 1918 in St.
Petersburg.
In the early nineties it passed into the hands of the liberal Narodniks beaded by N.
K.
Mikhai-lovsky.
The journal advocated a conciliatory attitude towards the tsarist government and conducted a bitter fight against Marxism and the Russian Marxists.
In 1906 it became the organ of the semi-Cadet Trudovik Popular Socialist Party.
p.
25 17Bulgakov, Sergei Nikolayevich (1871-1944)—bourgeois economist and idealist philosopher.
In the nineties a “legal Marxist”.
Advo-cated a revision of Marx’s doctrine on the agrarian question.
After the Revolution of 1905-07 joined the Cadets, preached philosophical mysticism, participated in the counter-revolutionary miscellany Vekhi.
In 1922 he was deported for counter-revolutionary activities.
p.
26 18Lenin refers to the polemic between Bulgakov and Struve over the book Wirtschaft und Recht nach der materialistischen Geschichtsauff-assung by the German Kantian Stammler.
p.
2619Lenin refers to Plekhanov’s articles “Bernstein and Materialism” in Die Neue Zeit No.
44 (1897-98.
Band II) and “Conrad Schmidt against Marx and Engels” in the same journal, issue No.
5 (1898-99.
Band I).
Die Neue Zeit—a theoretical journal of the German Social-Democratic Party, published in Stuttgart from 1883 to 1923.
Up to October 1917 it was edited by K.
Kautsky, and after him by Heinrich Cunow.
p.
26 20The reference is to Plekhanov’s article “The Sixtieth Anniversary of Hegel’s Death” in the journal Die Neue Zeit Nos.
7, 8, 9 (1891-92.
Band I).
Lenin’s reference to “the 30th anniversary” is obviously a slip of the pen.
p.
26 21The reference is to Axelrod’s articles “Die historische Berechtigung der russischen Sozialdemokratie” (later issued in Russia as a sepa-rate pamphlet under the title The Historical Position and the Mutual Relations between the Liberal and Socialist Democracy in Russia), published in the journal Die Neue Zeit No.
30 and No.
31 (1897-98.
Band II).
Lenin’s comments on Axelrod’s articles will be found on pp.
29-31 of this volume.
p.
26 22The reference is to Economism, an opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.
The Economists held that the political struggle against tsarism was mainly the business of the liberal bourgeoisie, while the workers were to confine themselves to an economic struggle for better working conditions, higher wages, etc.
They denied the leading role of the party of the working class and the significance of revolutionary theory in the labour move-ment, and maintained that that movement could only develop spontaneously.
Lenin gave a devastating criticism of Economism in his book What Is To Be Done? p.
26 23Narodism—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian revolutionary movement, which arose between the 1860s and 1870s.
The Narodniks were out to abolish the autocracy and hand over the landowners’ land to the peasantry.
At the same time they denied the develop-ment of capitalist relations in Russia to be a natural tendency, and accordingly regarded the peasantry, and not the proletariat, as the main revolutionary force, and the village commune as the embryo of socialism.
With the object of rousing the peasants to the struggle against the autocracy the Narodniks went into the country, “among the people”, but gained no support there.
In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks took a conciliatory stand towards tsarism, expressed the interests of the kulaks, and waged a bitter fight against Marxism.
p.
2724Lenin refers to the heated disputes between the Marxists and the Narodniks that raged among the exiles.
It was of one such clash in Orlov, Vyatka Gubernia, that Potresov wrote to Lenin about.
p.

Struve, M.
I.
Tugan-Baranovsky and others.

Plekhanov, V.
I.
Zasu-lich and others contributed to it.
Lenin wrote a number of book reviews for the journal (see present edition Vol.
4, pp.
65-73 and 94-103) which also published the first six paragraphs of Chapter III of his book The Development of Capitalism in Russia (see Vol.
3 of this edition).
p.
28 26The reference is to Lenin’s article “The Heritage We Renounce” (see Vol.
2, pp.
491-534, of this edition).
Skaldin (Yelenev, Fyodor Pavlovich) (1828-1902)—a Russian publicist and author; in the sixties of the 19th century a spokesman of bourgeois liberalism, contributed to the journal Otechestvenniye Zapiski.
Subsequently Slaldin sided with the extreme reactiona-ries.

From 1906 to 1918 it was issued under the name of Sovre-menny Mir (The Contemporary World).
p.
33 31Nauchnoye Obozreniye (Scientific Review)—a journal, published in St.
Petersburg from 1894 to 1903, accepted contributions from publicists and scientists of all schools and trends; widely used by liberals and “legal Marxists”.
The journal published occasional articles by Marxists.

Publication was resumed abroad in April 1902 by the Zhizn Social-Democratic group (V.
D.
Bonch-Bruyevich, V.
A.
Posse, V.
M.
Velichkina and others); six issues of the journal, twelve of Listok Zhizni and several volumes of the Zhizn Library series were published.
The group ceased to exist in December 1902 and the publish-ing-house was liquidated.
p.
35 38Apparently this refers to Plekhanov, with whom Lenin had talks in 1895 during his visit to Switzerland.
p.
35 39This refers to the split that took place at the First Conference of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad held in Zurich (Switzerland) in November 1898.
The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was founded in Geneva in 1894 on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group (see Note 58).
It had its own press where it printed revolu-tionary literature and published the non-periodic miscellany Rabot-nik.
At first the Emancipation of Labour group controlled the Union and edited its publications.
Eventually control passed to the opportunist elements—the Economists or the so-called “young” group.
At the First Conference of the Union held in November 1898 the Emancipation of Labour group announced their refusal to edit the Union publications.
The Group finally broke with the Union and left its ranks in April 1900 at the Second Conference of the Union, when the Emancipation of Labour group and its supporters walked out and established their own Sotsial-Demokrat organi-sation.

Lo-patin.
While working on this translation he carried on a corres-pondence with Marx and Engels in which he touched on the prob-lems of Russia’s economic development.
Danielson, however, failed to grasp the essence of Marxism and subsequently came out against it.
Lenin here refers to Danielson’s book Sketches of Our Post Re-form Social Economy in which its author elaborates Narodnik views on the development of post-reform national economy in Russia.

In questions of philos-ophy he attempted to set up a system of his own, known as “em-pirio-monism”, a species of subjective-idealist Machian philosophy, which was sharply criticised by Lenin in his book Materialism and Empirio-criticism (1909) (see Vol.

Other members of the group were P.

Axelrod, L.

Deutsch, V.

Za-sulich and V.

The E.
L.
group did a great deal to dis-seminate Marxism in Russia.
It translated into Russian, published abroad and distributed in Russia the works of the founders of Marxism: Manifesto of the Communist Party by Marx and Engels; Wage-Labour and Capital by Marx; Socialism: Utopian and Scien-tific by Engels and other works.
Plekhanov and his group dealt a severe blow to Narodism.
The two drafts of a programme for Rus-sian Social-Democrats written by Plekhanov in 1883 and 1885 and published by the E.
L.
group were an important step towards preparing the ground for and establishing a Social-Democratic Party in Russia.
An important part in spreading Marxist views in Russia was played by Plekhanov’s essays: Socialism and the Polit-ical Struggle (1883), Our Differences (1885) and The Development of the Monist View of History (1895).
The E.
L.
group, however, committed serious errors; they clung to remnants of the Narodnik views, underestimated the revolutionary capacity of the peasantry and overestimated the role of the liberal bourgeoisie.
These errors were the embryo of the future Menshevik views held by Plekhanov and other members of the group.
Lenin pointed out that the E.
L.
group “only laid the theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and took the first step towards the working-class movement” (see Vol.
20, p.
278 of this edition).
At the Second Congress of the R.

in August 1903 the E.

p.
48 59The rumour refers to the forthcoming publication of the newspaper Iskra.
Iskra (The Spark) was the first all-Russia illegal Marxist news-paper, it was founded by Lenin in 1900 and played an important role in building the Marxist revolutionary party of the working class in Russia.
As it was impossible to publish a revolutionary newspaper in Russia on account of police persecution, Lenin, while still in exile in Siberia, evolved a detailed plan for its publication aboard.
When his exile ended (in January 1900) Lenin immediately set about putting his plan into effect.
The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra was published in Leipzig in December 1900, later issues were published in Munich; from July 1902 the paper was published in London, and from the spring of 1903 in Geneva.
Considerable help in getting the newspaper going (the organisation of secret printing-presses, the acquisition of Russian type, etc.
) was rendered by the German Social-Democrats Clara Zetkin, Adolf Braun and others, as well as by Julian March-lewski, a Polish revolutionary residing at Munich at the time, and by Harry Quelch, one of the leaders of the English Social-Demo-cratic Federation.
The editorial board of Iskra consisted of V.
I.
Lenin, G.
V.
Ple-khanov, Y.
O.
Martov, P.
B.
Axelrod, A.
N.
Potresov and V.
I.

The first secretary of the board was I.
G.
Smidovich-Leman; in the spring of 1901 this post was taken over by N.
K.
Krupskaya, who also conducted the correspondence between Iskra and the Social-Democratic organisations in Russia.
Lenin was virtually Editor-in-Chief and the leading figure in Iskra, in which he pub-lished his articles on all fundamental issues of Party organisation and the class struggle of the proletariat in Russia, and dealt with the most important international events.
Iskra became the centre for the unification of Party forces, for the gathering and training of Party cadres.

, which was held in July-August 1903.
By the time the Congress was convened most of the local Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had adopted the Iskra position, approved its tactics, programme and plan of organisation, and recognised the newspaper as their leading organ.
A special resolution of the Congress noted Iskra’s exceptional role in the struggle to build the Party and adopted the newspaper as the Central Organ of the R.

The Second Congress approved an editorial board con-sisting of Lenin, Plekhanov and Martov.
Despite the Congress decision Martov refused to participate, and issues Nos.
46-51 of Iskra were edited by Lenin and Plekhanov.
Later Plekhanov adopted a Menshevik stand and demanded that all the old Menshe-vik editors be included in the editorial board of Iskra, although they had been rejected by the Congress.
Lenin could not agree to this, and on October 19 (November 1), 1903, he resigned from the Iskra editorial board.
He was co-opted to the Central Committee from where he conducted a struggle against the Menshevik oppor-tunists.
Issue 52 was edited by Plekhanov alone.
On November13 (26), 1903, Plekhanov, on his own initiative and in defiance of the will of the Congress, co-opted all the old Menshevik editors to the editorial board.
Beginning with issue 52 the Mensheviks turned Iskra into their own organ.

61In August 1899, upon receiving from A.

Ulyanova-Yelizarova in St.
Petersburg the manifesto of the Economists which she called “the Credo of the ‘young’ group”, Lenin wrote his Anti-Credo— “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats” (see Vol.
4, pp.
167-82 of this edition).
The author of the Credo was Y.
D.
Kuskova, then a member of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad.
The manifesto of the Economists was not intended for the press, and, as Lenin pointed out, was published “without the consent and per-haps even against the will of its authors”, because the Economists feared public criticism of their opportunist views (see Vol.
5, p.
364 of this edition).

Twelve numbers (nine books) were issued in all.
The editorial board of Rabocheye Dyelo was the centre of the Economists abroad.
Rabocheye Dyelo supported Bernstein’s slogan of “freedom of criticism” of Marxism, and took an opportun-ist stand on questions of the tactics and organisational tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats.
Its supporters propagated opportun-ist ideas making the proletariat’s political struggle subservient to the economic struggle; they exalted spontaneity in the working-class movement and denied the leading role of the Party.

A criticism of Rabochaya Mysl views, described as the Russian variety of inter-national opportunism, was given by Lenin in his article “A Retro-grade Trend in Russian Social-Democracy” (see Vol.

69Bernsteinism—an opportunist anti-Marxist trend in the interna-tional Social-Democratic movement, which originated in Germany at the end of the nineteenth century and was named after Eduard Bernstein, the German Social-Democrat.
Bernstein tried to revise Marx’s revolutionary doctrine in the spirit of bourgeois liberalism and to turn the Social-Democratic Party into a petty-bourgeois party of social reform.
In Russia this trend found support among the “legal Marxists” and the Economists.

In 1908-12 Plekhanov came out against the liquidators and headed the pro-Party Mensheviks.
During the First World War (1914-18) he adopted a social-chauvinist stand.
His attitude to the October Socialist Revolution was hostile, but he took no part in anti-Soviet activities.
Lenin thought highly of Plekhanov’s philosophical works and his role in disseminating Marxism in Russia; at the same time he sharply criticised Plekhanov for his deviations from Marxism and the serious mistakes in his political activities.

5271This refers to the negotiations between the editorial board of Iskra and the liberals concerning the publication of a supplement Sov-remennoye Obozreniye to the journal Zarya.
The talks, in which Lenin, Zasulich, Potresov, and Struve took part, started on Decem-ber 29, 1900, and continued through January 1901.
Struve rejected Point 7 of the draft agreement proposed by the Iskra and Zarya group concerning full freedom for the editors of Iskra to use all the political material received by Sovremennoye Obozreniye.
State-ments concerning the issue of Sovremennoye Obozreniye were written by Plekhanov on behalf of Iskra and Zarya and by Struve on behalf of the “democratic opposition” group.
The publication, however, did not materialise in view of Dietz’s refusal to publish the state-ments, which did not fulfil censorship requirements.
The talks between Iskra representatives and Struve were broken off and not resumed.

The task of the League was to disseminate the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and promote the building up of a militant Social-Democratic organisation.

In November 1901 the group issued a programmatic “Advertisement of the Publications of the Social-Democratic Borba Group”.
In its publications the group distorted the revolutionary theory of Marxism, interpreted it in a doctrinaire scholastic spirit and was hostile to Lenin’s organisational principles for building up the Party.
Owing to its deviations from Social-Democratic views and tactics, its disruptive activities and lack of contact with the Social-Democratic organi-sations in Russia, the group was refused admission to the Second Congress, by whose decision it was dissolved.

the Bundists constantly supported its opportunist wing (the Economists, Mensheviks and liquidators) and waged a struggle against the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism.
To the Bolshevik programme’s demand for the right of nations to self-determination the Bund opposed the demand for autonomy of the national culture.
During the years of reaction (1907-10) the Bund adopted a liquidators’ stand and took an active part in forming the anti-Party August bloc.
During the First World War (1914-18) the Bundists took a social-chauvinist stand.
In 1917 the Bund supported the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government and fought on the side of the enemies of the October Socialist Revolution, its leaders joining forces with the counter-revolution during the years of foreign military intervention and civil war.
At the sametime a swing towards co-operation with the Soviet government was to be observed among the Bund’s rank and file.
In March 1921 the Bund dissolved itself.

104 141Socialist-Revolutionaries (S.
R.
s)—a petty-bourgeois party in Rus-sia, formed at the end of 1901 and beginning of 1902 through the amalgamation of various Narodnik groups and circles.
The S.
R.
ssaw no class distinctions between the proletariat and the peasantry, glossed over the class differentiation and antagonism within the peasantry and denied the leading role of the proletariat in the revolution.
The tactics of individual terrorism which the S.
R.
s advocated as the principal method of fighting the autocracy caused great harm to the revolutionary movement and made it difficult to organise the masses for revolutionary struggle.
The agrarian programme of the S.
R.
s envisaged the abolition of private ownership of the land and its transfer to the village com-munes on the basis of equalised tenure, as well as the development of all forms of co-operation.
There was nothing socialistic in this programme, which the S.
R.
s sought to present as a programme for “socialising the land”, since abolition of private ownership of the land alone, as Lenin pointed out, cannot abolish the domination of capital and the poverty of the masses.
The Bolsheviks exposed the S.
R.
s’ attempts to pose as socialists, fought hard with them for influence over the peasantry and showed how harmful their tactics of individual terrorism were to the work-ing-class movement.
At the same time, they were prepared, on certain conditions, to make temporary agreements with the S.
R.
s in the struggle against tsarism.
The absence of class homogeneousness among the peasantry was responsible for the political and ideological instability and the organisational confusion in the S.
R.
party, and for its constant vacillation between the liberal bourgeoisie and the proletariat .
There had been a split in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party during the first Russian revolution, its Right wing forming the legal Trudovik Popular Socialist Party, which held views close to those of the Cadets, and the Left wing taking shape as the semi-anarchist league of Maximalists.
During the years of reaction (1907-10) the S.
R.
party suffered a complete ideological and organisational break-down, and the First World War found most of the S.
R.
s taking a social-chauvinist stand.
After the victory of the February bourgeois-democratic revo-lution in 1917 the S.
R.
s, together with the Mensheviks and Cadets, were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Gov-ernment of the bourgeoisie and landowners (the party’s leaders Kerensky, Avksentyev and Chernov were members of that govern-ment).
The Left wing of the S.
R.
s founded an independent party of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries at the end of November 1917.
In an effort to maintain their influence among the peasant masses, the Left S.
R.
s formally recognised the Soviet power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but shortly afterwards turned against the Soviet power.
During the foreign military intervention and civil war the S.
R.
s carried on subversive counter-revolutionary activities, strongly supported the interventionists and whiteguards, took part in counter-revolutionary plots, and organised terrorist acts against leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party.
After the civil war, the S.
R.
s continued their hostile activity against the Soviet state.

The Council further maintained that Lenin demanded for himself, as a representative of the C.
C.
, the right to attend the Congress “at a time when he was already in antagonism with the Central Committee”.
Actually, Lenin sent representatives to the Congress early in August, that is, before his conflict with the conciliator section of the C.

Petersburg and its environs” in connection with the mounting strike movement following the events of Bloody Sunday (January 9).
The Commission, headed by Senator Shidlovsky was made up of government officials, managers of state factories and manufacturers.
The Commission was to include representatives of the workers elected by two-stage elections.
The Bolsheviks launched a campaign in connection with these elections, exposing the true designs of tsarism, which had organised this Commission in order to draw the workers away from the revolutionary struggle.
When the electors presented their demands to the government, namely, freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly, etc.
Shidlovsky stated on February 18 (March 3), 1905 that these de-mands could not be granted.
After this the majority of the electors withdrew from the elections and appealed to the workers of St.
Pe-tersburg, who supported them by going on strike.
The Commission was dismissed on February 20 (March 5), 1905, without having started work.

was held in London from April 12 to 27 (April 25-May 10), 1905, and was attended by 24 vot-ing delegates and 14 delegates with a consultative voice.

All the Congress proceedings were guided by Lenin.
He wrote the drafts of all the basic resolutions adopted by the Congress and spoke on the question of the armed uprising, on the participation of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary government, on the attitude towards the peasant movement, on the Party Rules and on a number of other questions.
The Minutes of the Congress record over a hundred speeches and motions made by Lenin.
The Congress condemned the actions of the Mensheviks, their opportunism in organisational and tactical questions; it laid down the tactical line of the Bolsheviks aimed at the complete victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution and its development into a socialist revolution.
The resolutions of the Congress outlined the tasks of the proletariat as the leader of the revolution and the strategic plan of the Party in the bourgeois-democratic revolution namely, the proletariat in alliance with the peasantry, and with the liberal bourgeoisie isolated, was to fight for the victory of the revolution.
The Congress amended the Party Rules: a) it adopted Lenin’s wording of Clause One; b) it defined precisely the rights of the Central Committee and its relations with the local committees; c) it modified the organisational structure of the Party’s central bodies: in place of the two centres (the Central Committee, the Central Organ) the Congress established a single competent Party centre—the Central Committee.

The principal items on the agenda were the agrarian question, the current situation, the class tasks of the proletariat, the attitude to the Duma, and organisational questions.
On all issues a sharp struggle was waged between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
Lenin made reports and speeches on the agrarian question, the current situation, on the question of tactics in regard to the Duma elections, on the armed uprising and other questions.
The Mensheviks’ numerical preponderance at the Congress though slight, determined the character of the Congress decisions.
On a number of questions the Congress adopted Menshevik resolu-tions (the agrarian programme, the attitude towards the Duma, etc.
).
The Congress adopted Lenin’s formulation of Clause One of the Party Rules concerning membership of the Party.

352341Cadets—abbreviated name for members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the chief party of the liberal-monarchist bour-geoisie in Russia.
Founded in October 1905, its membership was made up of representatives of the bourgeoisie, Zemstvo leaders of the landowning class and bourgeois intellectuals.
The Cadets called themselves the “party of people’s freedom”.
Actually they strove towards a deal with the autocracy in order to preserve tsar-ism in the form of a constitutional monarchy.
Their watchword from the beginning of the imperialist war was “war to a victorious finish.
After the February revolution of 1917, as a result of a deal with the S.
R.
and Menshevik leaders of the Petrograd Soviet, they occupied key positions in the bourgeois Provisional Government and pursued a counter-revolutionary policy opposed to the interests of the people.
After the victory of the October Revolution the Cadets came out as implacable enemies of the Soviet power.
They took part in all the counter-revolutionary armed actions and campaigns of the interventionists.
Living abroad as émigrés after the defeat of the interventionists and whiteguards, the Cadets did not cease their anti-Soviet activities.

He was elected to the com-mittee that drafted a resolution on the question of “the relations between political parties and the trade unions”.
Lunacharsky’s pamphlet was not published owing to the tight-ening of the censorship in 1908.

Gorky’s letter was an accusatory document directed against Sienkiewicz’s defence of big private landownership in Poznan.
Gorky wrote to Sienkiewicz that, while he appreciated his gift as an artist, he protested against Sienkiewicz appealing to Wil-helm II with such arguments as the “peaceful” behaviour of the Poles, who were “not kindling the fire of revolution”, were punctually paying their taxes and providing soldiers for the Prussian army.
These words give me reason to doubt the strength of your love for the Polish people,” Gorky wrote in conclusion.
The 252 replies to Sienkiewicz’s questionnaire were published by him in book form in Paris, but Gorky’s reply was left out.

In January 1919 she was arrested and killed by order of the Scheidemann government.
Lenin, who thought highly of Rosa Luxemburg, often criti-cised her mistakes, thus helping her to adopt a correct stand.

397 387Otzovists (from the Russian word otozvat—recall)—the name given to some of the Bolsheviks (Bogdanov, Pokrovsky, Lunacharsky, Bubnov and others) who demanded that the Social-Democratic deputies in the Third Duma should be recalled and that work in the legal organisations should be stopped.
In 1908 the otzovists formed a group of their own and waged a struggle against Lenin.
They emphatically refused to sit in the Duma or work in the trade unions, co-operative societies and other mass legal and semi-legal organisations of the workers.
They strove to shut themselves up within the framework of the illegal organisation: to tear the Party away from the non-party masses and expose it to the attacks of reaction.
Lenin called the otzovists “liquidators of a new type” and “Mensheviks inside out”.
A variety of otzovism was ultimatumism.
The ultimatumists differed from the otzovists only in form.
They proposed that an ultimatum should first be presented to the Social-Democratic group in the Duma and if it was not complied with, the Social-Democratic deputies should be recalled from the Duma.
Ultimatumism was virtually otzovism in disguise.
Lenin called the ultimatumists “bashful otzovists”.
In the spring of 1909 the otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders formed a promotion group to organise an anti-Party school on the Isle of Capri (Bogdanov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky and others).
This group, in effect, was the centre of the anti-Party faction of otzovists, ultimatumists, and god-builders.
A meeting of the extended editorial board of Proletary held in June 1909 adopted a decision that “Bolshevism, as a definite tendency in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
has nothing in common with otzovism or ultimatumism” and called upon the Bolsheviks to resolutely combat this defection from revolutionary Marxism.
Bogdanov (Maximov), the guiding spirit of otzovism, was expelled from the ranks of the Bolsheviks.
Later, in his book “Left-Wing” Communism—an Infantile Disorder, Lenin wrote that the Bolsheviks were able to make anorderly retreat and preserve their forces after the failure of the revolution because “they ruthlessly exposed and expelled the revolutionary phrase-mongers, those who did not wish to under-stand that one had to retreat, that one had to know how to retreat, and that one had absolutely to learn how to work legally in the most reactionary of parliaments, in the most reactionary of trade unions, co-operative and insurance societies and similar organi-sations” (see Vol.

15 of this edition).
The Capri school was organised in 1909 on Capri (Italy) by the otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders.
The meeting of the extended editorial board of Proletary exposed the factional anti-Bolshevik nature of the school, which was condemned and quali-fied as “a new centre being formed for a faction breaking away from the Bolsheviks” (see Vol.
15, p.
450, of this edition).
The school began to function in August, lectures being read by Bogdanov, Alexinsky, Lunacharsky, Gorky, Lyadov, Pok-rovsky and Desnitsky.
Lenin declined the organisers’ invitation that he come to Capri as a lecturer.
In his letter to the school’s students, who insisted on his reading a cycle of lectures to them, Lenin explained that he could not do it inasmuch as it was “a school deliberately hidden away from the Party” in “a remote foreign spot” and bearing a factional character.
Lenin proposed to the students that they should come to Paris where they would learn real Social-Democracy instead of the “separatist factional ‘science’” of the otzovists and god-builders (see Vol.
15, pp.
472-78, of this edition).

In the period of preparation and conduct of the Octo-ber Revolution he wavered and was opposed to an armed uprising.
In November 1927 he was expelled from the Party for factional activities, was twice reinstated and expelled again for anti-Party activities.

In leading articles headed “Concerning the Article of a Geneva Comrade” and “On the Orga-nisational Discussion” the Golos people denied that they “winked at” liquidationism and accused the author of sectarianism.
In his reply (“On the Same Subject”) Georgien quoted a number of documents reflecting the activities of the liquidators in the orga-nisations in Russia.
No special article on this polemic appeared in Proletary.

The god-builders advocated the creation of a new “socialist” religion and tried to reconcile Marxism with religion.
An extended meeting of the editorial board of Proletary held on June 8-17 (21-30), 1909 condemned god-building and declared in a special resolution that the Bolshevik section of the Party had nothing in common with “such a distortion of scientific socialism”.

The tsarist govern-ment issued a Ukase on November 9 (22), 1906, regulating the peas-ants’ withdrawal from the communes and the establishment of their proprietary rights on the allotment lands.
Under this Stoly-pin law (which got its name from P.
A.
Stolypin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers) the peasant was free to withdraw from the village commune, take possession of his allotment on a pro-prietorship basis, and sell it.
The rural community was obliged to give the peasants who withdrew from the commune an allot-ment of land in one place (an otrub, homestead) The Stolypin reform speeded up the development of capitalism in the country-side and the process of differentiation among the peasantry, and sharpened the class struggle in the village.
The Stolypin reform is characterised and evaluated in a number of works by Lenin, notably in his The Agrarian Programme of Social-Democracy in the First Russian Revolution, 1905-1907 (see Vol.

In 1912 together with the Menshevik liquidators they joined the general anti-Party bloc (the August bloc) against the Bolsheviks, which was organised by Trotsky.

” Plekhanov, however, wrote that this meeting should be held later.
During the Copenhagen Congress of the Second International, at which Plekhanov and Lenin wrote to the Executive Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany protesting against the publication in Vorwärts of an anonymous and libellous article by Trotsky, an agreement was reached between Lenin and Plekhanov for a joint struggle for the Party and the Party principle against liquidationism and the liquidators, and for Plekhanov’s contribution to Rabochaya Ga-zeta.
