724 NotesPREFACE Volume 43 contains letters, notes and telegrams written from 1893 to the Great October Socialist Revolution in 1917 and published in volumes 46, 47, 48 and 49 of the Fifth (Russian) Edition of the Collected Works.
They are an essential complement to the correspondence published in volumes 34, 35 and 36 of the present edition.
Noteworthy are Lenin’s letters to P.
P.
Maslov relating to the beginnings of the working-class movement and the early spread of Marxism in Russia.
They reveal his keen interest in the economic situation in Russia and contain a scientific critique of the economic views of the liberal Narodniks (V.
Y.
Postnikov, V.
P.
Vorontsov, and others).
Included in the present volume are many documents from the period of struggle for the creation of a Marxist party in Russia.
Uncompromising struggle against Right opportunism (Economism and, later, Menshevism) and the anarchistic petty-bourgeois revolutionariness of the Left Na-rodniks, on the one hand, and against bourgeois liberalism, which sought to subordinate the working-class and democratic movement to its ends, on the other, is the main theme of the letters written in this period.
Stressing the need to build an independent proletarian Marx-ist party of a new type, Lenin underscored the importance of open political struggle against opportunists of all shades, for the political independence and unity of the working-class movement in Russia.
“Of course,” he wrote, “strug-gle in the press will cause more ill feeling and give us a good many hard knocks, but we are not so thin-skinned as to fear knocks! To wish for struggle without knocks, differ-ences without struggle, would be the height of naïveté,and if the struggle is waged openly it .
.
.
will lead, I repeat, a hundred times faster to lasting unity” (p.
48).
The letters throw light on the vast effort Lenin invested into founding Iskra, the first all-Russia political news-paper, and the journal Zarya, which played an exceptional role in the establishment of a Marxist party of the new type.
All of Lenin’s editorial and organisational work, which ranged from laying down the ideological guidelines, select-ing the authors and discussing and reviewing the materials submitted for publication to the transportation and cir-culation of the paper in Russia, is vividly reflected in these letters.
A number of letters written after the Second Congress of the Party have been included in this volume.
They do much to round out the picture of the struggle waged by the Bolsheviks against the Menshevik splitters, showing how, at a time when the Menshevik leaders sought to break up the united party that had just taken shape, Lenin pas-sionately fought for its unity, to prevent the division of local Party organisations.
Of particular interest are the letters to Yelena Stasova, F.
V.
Lengnik, V.
P.
Nogin, and I.
I.
Radchenko, and to the Moscow and other local Party committees.
Stressing the revolutionary services rendered by the old Iskra and exposing the Mensheviks, including Trotsky, who denied in a slanderous pamphlet the importance of both Iskra and the Second Party Congress, Lenin wrote: “Reading a pamphlet of this kind you can see clearly that the ‘Minority’ has indulged in so much lying and falsehood that it will be incapable of producing anything viable, and one wants to fight, here there is something worth fighting for” (p.
129).
The letters show what colossal effort Lenin devoted to restoring the central institutions of the Party, launching the Bolsheviks’ Central Organ, the newspaper Vperyod, and preparing for the Third Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P This volume also contains a number of letters relating to the period of the first Russian revolution, shedding light on the tactics of the Bolsheviks in the bourgeois-democratic revolution.
For instance, the letter to l’Humanité corre-spondent Etienne Avenard demonstrates the importance ofthe hegemony of the proletariat in the bourgeois-democrat-ic revolution, the correctness of the Bolshevik tactical line and the need for the alliance of the proletariat and the democratic peasantry against the “baseness and treachery of the bourgeoisie, who are day by day becoming more and more counter-revolutionary” (p.
174).
A considerable number of letters relate to the period of reaction, among them many to Camille Huysmans, Sec-retary of the International Socialist Bureau of the Second International, with whom Lenin corresponded in the ca-pacity of representative of the Central Committee of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
There are also letters to other leaders of the international working-class movement testifying to the broad connections Lenin and the Central Committee of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
had with this movement.
They illustrate the unflagging struggle Lenin waged against opportunism, for revolutionary tactics in the working-class movement, for unity in the ranks of the revolutionary Marxists and for the fraternal solidarity of the working people the world over.
A notable place among the letters of this period is occu-pied by correspondence bearing on the struggle against the Mensheviks and Trotsky, who impeded and sabotaged the work of the Party’s central institutions, and also against the Vperyod group, the otzovists and ultimatumists, whose “Left” phraseology and adventuristic policy threatened to isolate the Party from the working class, to divorce it from the masses, and virtually to liquidate it.
Lenin ex-posed the organisation by the otzovists of a Party school on Capri as a factional scheme and worked for a long time to organise a real Party school for revolutionary workers.
The letters written in the period of the new revolu-tionary upswing deal with the consolidation of the under-ground proletarian party and with the struggle against liquidationism.
Liquidationism, which first asserted itself among the Mensheviks in the period of reaction, continued to cause great harm to the working class and its Party even after a new upsurge had begun in the revolutionary move-ment.
Combating the liquidators, who underrated illegal work and urged renouncing underground methods, Leninfocussed the attention of Party cadres on combining illegal and legal forms of activity—utilisation of the Duma rostrum, participation in workers’ funds and other legal societies, etc.
This volume includes several documents ex-posing the conference called by the liquidators, who set up the short-lived August anti-Party bloc.
A number of letters are directed against the conciliators.
“You cannot sit between two stools,” Lenin wrote, “either you are with the liquidators or against them” (p.
271).
These letters afford an idea of the difference between the tactics used to combat the anti-Party trends and the ap-proach to those who sought reconciliation with these trends.
While calling for uncompromising struggle against the liquidators on the main issues of principle, Lenin counselled taking a different line towards the conciliators, explaining things to them in order to win them over.
In a letter to L.
B.
Kamenev commenting on the latter’s pamphlet Two Tactics, he wrote: “We must not call for a break with the conciliators.
This is quite uncalled for and incorrect.
A ‘persuasive’ tone should be adopted towards them, by no means should they be antagonised” (p.
279).
The irreconcilable struggle waged by the Bolsheviks against the liquidators ended in the expulsion of the latter from the Party at the Sixth (Prague) Conference.
The volume includes a large number of letters to the editorial boards of the legal Bolshevik newspapers Zvezda, Nevskaya Zvezda, and especially Pravda.
The advice con-tained in these letters (as well as his articles) determined the political and ideological orientation of Pravda, its un-compromising stand towards the liquidators and their news-paper Luch.
In the spring of 1913 Pravda was reorganised, its contents greatly improved and its size increased in accordance with Lenin’s instructions.
Congratulating the editors and staff on the improvement of content, Lenin set the task of fighting “to win 100,000 readers.
.
.
.
The great (and sole) danger for Pravda now is the loss of the broad reader-ship, loss of a position to fight for it” (p.
350).
A prominent place is occupied by documents written in connection with the preparations for and the convocation of many Party conferences and meetings.
These include let-ters in which Lenin gives his assessment of the Cracow andPoronin meetings of the C.
C.
with Party functionaries, the Fourth Congress of the Latvian Social-Democrats, etc.
Speaking of the Cracow meeting held in January 1913, Lenin wrote: “It’s going wonderfully.
It will be no less significant than the 1912 January Conference.
There will be resolutions on all important issues, unity included” (p.
327).
The volume includes many letters written to Inessa Ar-mand in connection with the convocation of the Brussels “unity” conference by the International Socialist Bureau in July 1914.
Guided by Lenin’s instructions, the delega-tion of the Central Committee exposed at this conference the harm caused by liquidationism and called for unity of the working-class movement from below.
The liquidators did not achieve their ends, the support given them by in-ternational opportunism did not yield the results they had expected.
“The liquidators’ last card is the help of the foreign organisations, but that card, too, will be beaten,” Lenin wrote (p.
424).
The large number of letters written during the imperial-ist world war (1914-17) afford an idea of the tremendous theoretical and practical work Lenin accomplished in elabo-rating and propagating the Bolshevik tactics of struggle against imperialist war, and of his uncompromising atti-tude towards social-chauvinism and Kautskyism.
The letters to V.
A.
Karpinsky, Sophia Ravich, G.
L.
Shklovsky, M.
N.
Pokrovsky and others throw light on the circum-stances in which some of Lenin’s most important articles and books were written and published—Socialism and War, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, etc.
The let-ters are a complement to such works as “The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determina-tion”, “The Junius Pamphlet”, “A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism” and others, and offer a model of the creative approach to the revolutionary theory of Marxism.
In them Lenin, through profound study and generalisation of the historical experience of proletarian class struggle, outlines the tasks of international Social-Democracy and the working-class movement at the time of the imperialist world war, and develops the fundamental Marxist propositions concerning just and unjust wars andthe defence of the country.
The volume also contains letters criticising the anti-Marxist views of N.
I.
Bukharin, G.
L.
Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosh.
Firmly and consistently upholding the basic principles of Marxism, Lenin combat-ed at the same time the conciliatory position taken by G.
Y.
Zinoviev.
The letters to V.
A.
Karpinsky reflect the tremendous practical work done by Lenin in connection with the resump-tion of publication of Sotsial-Demokrat, the Central Organ of the Party.
Transporting the paper to Russia, arrange-ments with contributors and many other things all the way to minor details (type and paper) claimed his attention.
For instance, in a letter to Karpinsky dated November 22, 1914, he wrote: “Write and let us know for how many is-sues you have thin paper.
If there is plenty (we shall probably get some more from Paris) and if it is not too bad for local use, we shall increase the % of thin paper” (p.
436).
Despite the difficulty of establishing contacts with the local Party organisations, the Central Committee headed by Lenin arranged for the circulation in Russia of Bol-shevik literature exposing the imperialist character of the war, educating the workers, soldiers and peasants politi-cally and teaching them how to combat the war, and calling on them to rise against their own exploiters.
The Central Committee maintained contact with the Party organisations in Russia through Stockholm and later through Oslo, where A.
G.
Shlyapnikov was representative of the Central Committee and the Petersburg Committee at the time.
Some of the letters to Shlyapnikov may therefore be regarded as letters to the Central Committee Bureau in Russia.
Contact with Russia was maintained also through M.
M.
Litvinov, Alexandra Kollontai, and others.
Lenin attached prime importance to rallying the forces of the Left Social-Democrats in the various countries of Europe and America.
Included in the present volume are his letters to Left Social-Democrats in Holland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and other coun-tries.
He arranged for the circulation of the Central Organ, Bolshevik publications, resolutions of the Conference of R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Groups Abroad, etc.
, among the revolutionarySocial-Democrats of many countries, and established per-sonal contacts with them.
In a letter to H.
Gorter he sup-ported the idea of founding an international journal of the Left Social-Democrats to counter the social-chauvinists’ mean way of “defending opportunism of the worst brand by means of sophisms” (p.
453).
In a letter to David Wijn-koop Lenin pointed out: “What we need is not the solemn declarations of leaders .
.
.
but a consistent revolutionary declaration of principles to help the workers find the cor-rect path” (p.
478).
From the beginning of the war, when the Second Inter-national collapsed ideologically and politically and in effect broke up, with the various Social-Democratic parties at loggerheads with one another, Lenin advo-cated the establishment of a Third International to include the Left, genuinely revolutionary internationalists.
Writing to G.
Y.
Zinoviev, he said: “I am sending Wijn-koop’s letter.
Return it immediately.
.
.
.
I shall snatch at this ‘little kernel’ of a Left International with both hands.
We must work as hard as we can to get closer together with them” (p.
461).
A number of letters deal with the preparations for the Zimmerwald and Kienthal International Socialist Confe-rences and also the popularisation of their decisions.
In the course of the preparatory work for the Kienthal Conference Lenin advised the Dutch internationalists to contact the minority of the British Socialist Party and urge them to send “either a representative, or at least a declaration.
If, as a result of this conference, we receive .
.
.
a Left Marxist international declaration of principles, it will be a very useful thing” (p.
482).
Of particular interest are the letters written in early 1917 and in the last days spent by Lenin abroad, when it became known that the February bourgeois-democratic revolution had been successful.
They constitute a valuable addition to other Lenin documents containing an analysis of the revolutionary developments in Russia and the new tasks he set before the proletarian party, the workers, peas-ants and soldiers.
Several letters relate to arrangements for Lenin’s return, together with other Party workers, from Switzerland to Russia.
The volume closes with a note to Margarita Fofanova writ-ten late at night on October 24 (November 6), 1917: “I am going where you did not want me to go.
Good-bye.
Ilyich” (p.
638).

QX 1 TO P.
P.
MASLOV I received your letter * the day before yesterday, and yes-terday I wrote to inform you that the articles on the peas-ant reform 1 had been sent to you.
Let me know whether you have the article on Postnikov.
** If you have it, send it as soon as you can to N.
Y.
with the request that it be forwarded to me immediately after it has been read; I need it.
I am very sorry you did not find me in Samara.
*** Are you planning a trip to the capitals for the holidays? If you are, we could meet.
I am expecting from you a critical analysis in as minute detail as possible of the article on Postnikov: I trust you have noticed that I am drawing far more important and far-reaching conclusions from the premises set forth in it than are to be found in the article itself.
The disintegra-tion of our small producers (the peasants and handicrafts-men) appears to me to be the basic and principal fact ex-plaining our urban and large-scale capitalism, dispelling the myth that the peasant economy represents some special structure (it is the same bourgeois structure with the sole difference that it is still shackled to a far greater extent by feudal fetters), and making it patent that what are called “workers” are not a handful of specially circumstanced * You could have found out my address from the Bar Council here.

people but simply the outer layers of the vast mass of peas-ants who already derive their livelihood more from the sale of their labour power than from their own husbandry.
I value Postnikov’s book so highly just because it con-tains data for a precise examination of the situation, pro-vides factual proof of the absurdity of the current notions concerning our “communal” village, and shows that, essen-tially, the pattern in our country does not differ from that of Western Europe.
I offered the article to Russkaya Mysl 2 but it did not choose to publish it.
I have been wondering whether it would be better to enlarge and revise the article somewhat and publish it in pamphlet form.
It would be very interesting to hear your opinion on this; I think this could be done by correspondence.
The basic premise in my comments on the works about the reform was that this reform stemmed from the develop-ment of commodity economy and that its entire meaning and purpose was the destruction of the fetters retarding and restricting the development of this system.
We shall discuss this in greater detail some other time—perhaps I shall be able to forward to you the comments I sent to the author; this would be simplest and most convenient.
Let me have your reply as soon as possible, indeed at once, otherwise the letter may not find me here.

Concerning your comments, ** I should like to say this.
First, as regards the conclusions being too cautious, it should be borne in mind that this shortcoming I fully agree that this is really a shortcoming is due to my intention to have the article published in a liberal journal.
I actually was naïve enough to send it to Russkaya Mysl, which of course turned it down: I fully understood why when I read in Russkaya Mysl No.

It takes some artistry to mutilate splendid material so thoroughly and to bury the facts in sheer verbiage! The fact is that I draw from these data some major con-clusions.
Namely, that the data, in my opinion, point to the bourgeois nature of the economic relationships existing among the peasantry.
They strikingly reveal the existence * The person referred to has not been identified.

** See previous letter.
—Ed.
of antagonistic classes in this “communal” peasantry; moreover, of classes that are characteristic only of capital-ist organisation of the social economy.
This is the cardinal conclusion, and one fully applicable to the rest of the Rus-sian peasantry.
Another conclusion is that already now a huge proportion (probably no less than half and most likely more) of peasant-grown grain goes to the market, and that the principal producer of this grain is the top group of the present-day village—the peasant bourgeoisie.
* Further, I attach much importance to the fact estab-lished by Postnikov that as a rule throughout Russia the productivity of labour is 2-2 2 times higher in the upper groups of the peasantry.
This is of enormous importance from the theoretical standpoint, as is the ascertaining of the commercial farm area (a point so dangerous for the Rus-sian exceptionalists that I fully appreciate Mr.
V.
V.
’s careful avoidance of the question).
As for your second remark—concerning the norm of natural economy—I must admit that I do not quite under-stand you.
The question of a “norm”, to my mind, is meaningful only in this sense: it is important to know how big an area the average peasant must cultivate to meet all his needs (both production and personal) and manage without out-side earnings.
This is important to know since all peasant farms below this level fall into the category of those selling labour power, and the size of the farm is a fairly accurate indicator to what extent it depends on this source of income.
Households in the higher groups are petty-bourgeois pure and simple.
As regards the share of “natural” economy, I believe it is invariably the greatest in the middle group of peasants, but there too commodity economy is bound to account for a substantial proportion (probably some 40 per cent of the * Hourwich is therefore mistaken when he says that Russia will in the future become a country of the peasant bourgeoisie.
It is that already.
A very good book: Hourwich, The Economics of the Russian Village, 1892.
New York.
total budget must be in monetary form).
Farms of the lower and top groups will always be more of a commodity type, for the first sells labour power and the second, sur-pluses of grain.
The analysis of the groups given in the article on Post-nikov is along these lines.
You speak of the “norm of natural economy” and the “norm of commodity economy” as of two separate things.
If I understood you right, the latter is my average norm 17-18 dessiatines of crop area according to Postnikov’s figures in which, of course, it is important to separate and calculate exactly the natural and money components.
I do not see that there is any self-contained “norm of natural economy”; our contemporary peasant economy cannot be a pure natural economy whatever its dimensions.
However, here it is better to wait for a more detailed explanation from you.

K.
Mikhailovsky, I also believe that no publication will print it, not so much be-cause of considerations of censorship (rumour has it that the censors are exorcising Russian Marxism following the commotion raised by Russkoye Bogatstvo 3 ) as of dis-agreement with you and fear of an impudent and conceited “big wig”.

The article will also be sent to the Emancipation of Labour group, so please do not be annoyed by a possible delay.
My colleague has one point to make: the credit for es-tablishing the first contacts with the workers belongs not to the groups you mention, but to the Chaikovsky group.

Written October 1 0 , 1 9 0 0 First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the original 9 TO APOLLINARIA YAKUBOVA* I clearly see two trends also in your letter to a friend: one quite legitimately lays the stress on the need for eco-nomic struggle, the need to be able to make use of the workers’ legal societies as well, “to respond in diverse ways to the day-to-day vital needs of the workers”, and so on.
All this is legitimate and correct.
You are mistaken if you think that the revolutionaries “are opposed to legal societies”, that such societies are “hateful” to them, that they “turn their backs on society”, and so on.
The revolu-tionaries too recognise the necessity of economic struggle, of responding also to the day-to-day vital needs, and of learning to make use of legal societies as well.
Not only have the revolutionaries never and nowhere advised to turn one’s back on society, but on the contrary have stressed that it is essential for Social-Democracy to take the lead in the social movement and to unite under the leadership of the revolutionary Social-Democratic Party all the de-mocratic elements.
However, it is imperative to take care that the legal societies and purely economic organisations should not separate the workers’ movement from Social-Democracy and revolutionary political struggle, but that they should, on the contrary, link them as closely and in-dissolubly as possible.
But in your letter there is also that tendency (a harmful and, in my opinion, thoroughly reac-tionary one), the tendency to separate the workers’ move-ment from Social-Democracy and revolutionary political struggle—to put off the political tasks, to replace the * A variant of part of the letter (see present edition, Vol.
34, pp.
51-54).
—Ed.
concept “political struggle” with the concept “struggle for legal rights”, and so on.
How to draw the line between the sound and useful tendency and the harmful one? I believe there is no need for me to persuade you who have already had a taste of “meetings abroad” that we must not confine ourselves to mere talk.
And would it not be ridiculous to fear examination of the question in print since it has already been discussed for a long time in letters and debates.
Why should debates at meetings and writing letters be considered permissible and elucidation of controversial issues in the press a “most harmful thing capable only (???) of amusing our enemies”? This I cannot understand.
Only polemics in the press can precisely establish the dividing line I am referring to, for some people are often bound to go to extremes.
Of course struggle in the press will cause more ill feeling and give us a good many hard knocks, but we are not so thin-skinned as to fear knocks! To wish for struggle without knocks, differences without struggle, would be the height of naïveté, and if the struggle is waged openly it will be a hundred times better than foreign and Russian “Gubarevism”, and will lead, I repeat, a hundred times faster to lasting unity.

01 Dear Comrade, We have already read the proofs of your article and it probably has been printed, so that it is impossible to make any changes now.
As for the deletion, we did it.
We of course would not presume to make any changes affecting the essential ideas of the author without asking his per-mission first.
The given deletion, however, was prompted by purely technical considerations.
No editorial office can relinquish the right to make cuts of this order.
We were quite certain that you would see yourself that the deletions we have made in no way alter the author’s train of thought or detract from the weightiness of his arguments.
We hope very much that you will not take this in bad part and that you will continue your co-operation which we value so highly.
The agreement with the liberals which we hinted at in the previous letter * has been concluded.
12 We undertake the publication of a separate general political supplement to Zarya which will also carry part of our current mate-rials.
We trust that your group 13 will lend a hand with this supplement too.

01 Thanks for the letter and the detailed analysis of Iskra.
Thorough and well-argumented appraisals pointing out slips (inevitable in such a difficult job as this) are so rare that one appreciates them doubly.
Your interest in Iskra reinforces my hope that we shall work together for it.
I fully agree with you that the review of home develop-ments is skimpy.
In the second issue it is better, but skimpy nonetheless.
It is one of the most difficult sections, and only gradually can it be put on a satisfactory footing.
As regards contributions from correspondents, you are not quite right, in my opinion.
The coincidence with Ra-bochaya Mysl 15 No.
10 incidentally, I have not seen the issue; please send it to me does not bother me.
It shows that we too have contacts with the St.
Peters-burg League, 16 and that is a very good thing.
Your interpretation of the advice “to be careful” con-tained in the item about the crisis 1 7 is in my view erro-neous and far-fetched.
It is clear from the context that the warning is only against strikes, and since next to this it is pointed out that strikes are not the only means of strug-gle, that it is necessary in these difficult times to use other methods of struggle: propaganda (“to explain”) and agita-tion (“to prepare for more resolute—N.
B.
—struggle ” ), I categorically protest against comparing the call “to be careful” with the Rabochaya Mysl kind of thinking.
The advice “to be careful” when it comes to strikes and toprepare for more resolute struggle is the exact opposite of the Rabochaya Mysl position.
Your point about demonstrations is fully justified, but, first, this enters precisely into the broader concept of “more resolute struggle”; second, it would be out of place to make this call more concrete and definite since there is no direct occasion for such action and it is impossible to assess the overall situation in detail.
In issue No.
2, in a commentary on one particular strike and an item in Yuzhny Rabochy, 18 an attempt is made to be more definite on this score.
I cannot agree that the demand for state unemployment insurance could serve to stir the workers into action.
I doubt whether this is right in principle: in a class state unemployment insurance can hardly amount to more than a deception.
From the standpoint of tactics, it is especial-ly out of place in Russia, since our state is fond of experi-ments in “etatisation”, loves to advertise them as being for the “common good ” , and we should resolutely oppose any extension of the functions of the present state and work for more freedom for public initiative.
Aid and benefits for the unemployed are all right, but “state insurance”—? Your point that the article about Zubatov is not quite rounded out is perhaps justified.
19 As for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Decembrists— this really was an omission.
20 ____ If you wish, I can get you a Bulgarian passport.
Write me if you need it, and if so, let me have the particulars for identification.
The transport situation has improved and we may be able to manage without the help of new people.
Please send me “Rabochaya Mysl”, and also Byloye 21 and other London publications.
I would also like to have a cata-logue of publications put out by the Fabian Society and other socialist firms.
Which British newspaper would you recommend? Can you send me a couple of issues as samples? I subscribed to Justice 22 but was not satisfied with it.

01 We of course agree with your plan to begin publication of bulletins 31 at once.
Only it is necessary to work out the organisational aspects of the scheme, that is, to settle some inevitable preliminary questions.
For instance, will the entire Iskra promotion group in Berlin be involved in publishing and editing the bulletins (if I am not mistaken, the idea was not to inform the whole group of our organisa-tional plan as yet), or just a part of it, or a few individu-als? Will the title of the bulletins indicate their relation-ship to Iskra or not? It would also be desirable that the programme of the bulletins should accord with the pro-gramme put forward in our draft and that the editors should see to it that the departments (translations of Polish, Finnish and other literature) are distributed among Iskra sympathisers and supporters.
Lastly, it is essential definitely to decide (the decision of course should not be published) that the group publishing and editing the bulletins under-take the task provisionally with a view to turning it over to an elected Literary Commission when the Iskra organi-sation abroad which we have proposed has been openly constituted.
There are also other matters which you of course will see for yourself and settle when you get down to working out your plan organisationally in its final form.
We on our part shall select some material we have on hand and send it to you.
Let us know when you plan to put out the first issue.

01 Dear Leiteisen, As regards Muzykant, we believe that since he se met à notre disposition ** and is an enterprising man, it is of course necessary to try and send him at once to the very frontier to take direct charge of the consignments, and not only to take charge but to attend personally to conveying them across (respective: to cross the frontier with a smuggler).
Since he agrees, he should be given 200 frs.
(that is, the 100&100 you wrote about) and probably sent to us.
We were wondering whether he should come here or just go to Berlin to talk things over there with our representa-tive, but have arrived at the conclusion that he will have to take a trip here; we have a number of more or less certain contacts at the frontier and near it, and without thorough consultation with the person who is to go there we cannot decide exactly where he should go and what “pretext” to choose.

Ryazanov is here and we have been discussing the plan for our organisation with him.
At first he rejected our plan categorically and “resentfully”, but then, after the proviso was inserted that all this was temporary, for one year, he agreed conditionally on his own behalf but assured us that Nevzorov would not agree on any account (?).
There is also—just in case—another plan: a federation of Sotsial-Demokrat, Zarya and Borba, with the last-mentioned put-ting out only pamphlets (not a paper), participating in an advisory capacity in the work of Zarya and Iskra, contribut-ing, like the other members, its share to the federation’s treasury, raising funds independently by arranging socials, etc.
What do you think of this latter project? To me it seems unfair—it grants too much to Borba—and I doubt whether it would be acceptable to all.
Generally speaking we believe that an understanding can be reached with Borba too; they also seem to be ready to make concessions seeing that we have no intention of giving up our position.

The future of the entire business now largely depends on such as-sistance, for the initial funds have been used up in getting started and it will take at least a year of full-scale work for the enterprise to begin paying for itself.
In the spring of last year (1900) one of us had a talk with your friend (whom you probably now often see) who also expressed confidence that you would not refuse to help.
We hoped that with your connections you would be able to collect a substantial lump sum, though our organisation is of course in need of periodical contributions as well.

We have decid-ed to arrange a meeting with the author of “The Rebirth of Revolutionism in Russia”, *** but under no circumstances in Munich.
We chose Zurich, so that our delegate (it is proposed that I should go) could also meet you on the same trip.
The meeting is planned for August 8 -10 (before the 12th), new style.
Please let us know whether you can allow us to use your flat for the meeting and whether you can be in Zurich at the time so that we could meet (or, rather, whether I can take a trip to see you, for why should you do any travel-* Written together with Krupskaya.

The gentleman in question will come to your flat (we shall instruct him accordingly through Alexei’s sister in Geneva, unless you think otherwise), introduce himself as Sokolovsky and ask you (or your wife) for the Iskra repre-sentative.
Alexei’s sister will wire me when he will leave, and I shall come to Zurich in good time, concealing from him (we fear to trust him too much) my whereabouts.
We have seen the Narodnaya Volya journal Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii 34 (Ryazanov showed us a copy) but have not received it ourselves, promises notwithstanding.
I glanced through only the editorial and a review of Iskra (favour-able, but for terrorism).
We should be getting it soon, and so should you.

wire is very dangerous, for they take copies of telegrams.
Try confining yourself to the post.
There is no need to come over to discuss details.
All that can be arranged by letter.
Do you happen to have an experienced printer? If so, mats, which are easy to send (in journals, etc.
), can be used.
The advantages of this method are: 1) no type is needed, 1a) it is far quicker, 2) less people, which means greater safety in underground work, 3) the paper will have a for-eign look, which too is a big advantage from the stand-point of secrecy.
By way of experiment we shall send you shortly matrices enclosed in book binding, addressed to K.

.

* Open them carefully, try them out and let us know the results as soon as you can.
A universal stereotyper for making type-casts from matrices costs about 300 marks, but whether one can be freely obtained in Russia we do not know.
Let us know what the size of your machine is.
Can it print sheets the size of our Iskra? In general, send us at the earliest date some sample of your work.
If you have the technical facilities, try to put out as soon as possible at least one complete issue of Iskra (if you find it difficult to print an 8-page paper, such as No.
6, at least put out No.
5—it’s four pages).
It would be extremely important for us to have a copy of the Russian edition of Iskra in time for the conference 35 here, that is, within a month (at most a month and a half).
Since when are we 800 rubles in debt? Our funds are now low and the debt can be covered only if your printing facilities actually turn out at least three to five thousand copies of Iskra (4-8 pages) a month.
If you manage to do that there will of course be a net income.
Where did you send the packages you received? Why send 5 poods to Yekaterinoslav? We do not risk sending more than a pood or two as a first try; it doesn’t matter if it costs more.

GOLDMAN To Akim Dear Comrade, We were very glad indeed to receive your parcel.
A magnificent job; even Tsvetov says so.
You misunderstood us.
We were not at all against the publication of Iskra in Russia.
On the contrary, we are fully aware that the business will benefit greatly by it, and always wanted this to be done, but we confess we had little faith in the suc-cess of the undertaking.
Now you have given us that faith.
We are sending you an article by X intended for Zarya No.
2, but in our opinion it would be very useful to put it out as a pamphlet.
You will probably agree with us when you read it.
Print 1,000 copies of it.
There will be no more delays with material.
Let us know when you want the copy for the next pamphlet.
Later on we shall send material for the paper.
* We repeat, we are very glad indeed.
There will be an item in No.
7 about the Veto myth—it’s all sheer nonsense.
You are quite right when you write that Iskra should organise.
But you are wrong in saying an organisation should have been left behind in Russia.
To do this, so to speak, in advance was out of the question; only when things get under way will it be possible to tell how the organi-sation should shape.
Now—and here you are right—there is chaos (partly due to the method of delivery), most of our representatives write to us about this.
We are thinking of sending the project we have drawn up for an organisation to two or three people in Russia for consideration, and working out the rules for the organisation with their help.
We have not received the Odessa leaflets.
Please send them.
* It would be extremely important for us to have a Russian edition of Iskra as soon as possible.
If you are not quite up to it, put out separate articles from the paper.

01 Dear P.
B.
, We received your letter of the 30th and, today, your letter from Niedelbad informing us that the meeting can be arranged at your place.
I am very glad.
I hope we shall see each other this week and have a good talk, and therefore shall confine myself to a brief note on “business”.
I wrote today via Stuttgart to a man named Finn in Zurich—it was a letter of recommendation to you.
My wife and sister knew this Finn (slightly) in Russia (before his arrest).
He created the impression of a superficial person, but there were no grounds to doubt his honesty.
He was picked up in the Moscow affair 36 together with the noto-rious traitor Ruma and was exiled to Astrakhan.
Other Astrakhan exiles (well known to us) likewise did not question his honesty, all the more so since Finn was one of the first to identify Ruma as a traitor.
Going abroad after exile, Finn stayed for a time in Ber-lin where our representatives evidently were friendly with him at first, but then parted company with him, and yes-terday I got an unexpected letter from a Berliner saying that Finn “does not observe Party ethics”, that “he makes a repulsive impression”, that he “knew of Ruma’s rela-tions with Zubatov”, that although they do not think Finn is a spy they recommend caution.
Astounded by this letter, we carried caution so far that * Postscript to a letter written by Krupskaya.
—Ed.
I did not even see Finn * (Alexei, without revealing that he was in on things, merely told him where the rendezvous was to take place), instead my wife saw him and told him that I was living in Stuttgart and was there at the moment.
Because of this I wrote to him through Stuttgart, and would ask you to keep up the fiction.
Finn is a writer of sorts.
I believe that Alexei and I made a mistake in not seeing him and going into the affair personally.
Apparently Finn parted company with the Ber-liners because he would not agree to their demand: to give Iskra the full story of the Ruma affair.
This aroused their suspicion.
Finn told my wife that he could not do it be-cause Ruma would then have direct evidence of his, Finn’s, connections with the illegal press.
Instead Finn gave my wife a note of a few lines saying that there is no doubt about Ruma’s dealings with Zubatov.
To get to the bottom of all this, I shall write at once to my sister, who knew Finn before his arrest and met him in Moscow.
I shall ask her to reply both to me and directly to you.
You, on your part, please talk to Finn and sound him out, and besides, if it is not inconvenient, detain him in Zurich for a couple of extra days so that I could also see him (it will be much more convenient there than here) and try to correct the mistake I made because of the shocking letter from Berlin.

01 Dear L.
I.
, Forgive me for not replying at once and for being very brief: I’ve again caught something like influenza and my head is absolutely no good.
In my opinion, if no account of the conference can be compiled we should do the follow-ing: all the documents and statements submitted at the conference to the bureau (the Geneva* resolutions, the amend-ments to them, the statement of the Union and our state-ment on the Bund, our declaration on withdrawal, etc.
) should be printed consecutively, none of the speeches need be given (not even mentioned, to say nothing of a detailed account), just link the documents with a couple of words.
It seems to me that the documents are so eloquent and speak for themselves so clearly that it is enough to print them (merely indicating how, in what order and on what issues they were submitted or read out) for all sensible people fully to understand why we walked out.
39 If you do not have the questions submitted by Frey, ask Leiteisen and Dan; they may have them.
Try to confine yourself to such a comparison of docu-ments and send the result as soon as possible to Geneva; * In the manuscript: “London”, by mistake.

they will print them there and perhaps make some minor amendments if such are needed.

01 Dear Leiteisen, I saw the gentleman * to whom you revealed a League 40 secret and who is now raising a fuss.
I must say that you made a rather big mistake.
First, why did you speak about this gentleman to Leibov and Wasserberg, who are not members of the League?? He complains particularly bitterly about this.
And he is right.
The attitude of the League towards third persons should be known only to League members.
I think you ought to tell Leibov and Wasserberg off properly and not trust them so much in the future: if you found it possible to tell them, they should have kept silent without fail.
Second, why didn’t you put an end to the affair at once, thereby preventing the gentleman from making the trip to see G.
V.
and us?? After all, you are an official function-ary, a member of the administration.
You should have therefore accepted from the gentleman whatever statement he wanted to submit, and after discussing it with others, given him a proper collective answer.
You should have told him that he could contact the League only through you and that hence he was obliged to submit to you what-ever complaints he had against the League in general or one of its members in particular and had no right to take the matter up with the wrong people (G.
V.
or us).
As I see it, you departed from the rules (according to * A reference to A.
Y.
Finn-Yenotayevsky.
—Ed.
which all complaints are to be dealt with by the administra-tion) and are guilty, besides indiscretion, of failure to ex-ercise your authority.
Well, so much for that.
Do not be offended by my frank-ness.
Now l’incident est clos.
* We, needless to say, told the gentleman this: we do not advise you to turn to the League concerning yourself (i.
e.
, to ask whether the League trusts you, etc.
).
There is no point in doing that.
The League is not obliged to reply.
What you ought to do is this: do everything you can to throw light on the Ruma affair (in all its aspects), collect all the evidence and ask the League to review the case and publish the findings (i.
e.
, the accusation against Ruma and, eventuellement, ** the exoneration of others).
He agreed that this was the only way to go about it and set to work putting down his own testimony.
If you know of any other witnesses, take steps yourself to get their evidence.
And so our tactics now are: within the League, a reserved attitude towards the “gentleman” for the time being.
But not a word about it outside the League, or even to the more aloof members of the League.

objective about the “incident”.
Since you did disclose a secret to a not too discreet person, some measure of indiscretion there evi-dently was.
Of course, this can happen to anyone, and please do not think that I am repeating this for any other reason than to close the incident once and for all.
But you must admit that we had some very unpleasant moments and explanations to face not through any fault of our own, for it was not we who told Leib.
.
.
things that could not but make the “gentleman” blow up.
And now as to the substance of the matter.
Once the “gentleman” learned (in whatever way) that the League had decided against him (or that a League member had voiced the opinion that it was necessary to take a reserved attitude toward him, that is, the “gentleman”, * which amounts to the same thing), the League was involved in the affair.
This is something that cannot be undone, any more than you can recapture a word that has been spoken.
And for heaven’s sake do not add another mistake to the first: do not say now that “the League has nothing to do with it”! The League is already involved, and the only question now is how to disentangle it.
The “gentleman” wanted to apply to the League concern-ing himself (you evidently did not quite understand me on this score), i.
e.
, concerning the grounds on which League members had cast aspersions on him.
We persuaded him that nobody had cast any “asper-sions”, and as regards its reservations, the League is not accountable to anyone.
This finishes the personal question concerning the “gentleman”.
But there still remains the public question of the Ruma affair, about which we have long been receiving letters urging that it be cleared up.
The reservations in relation to the “gentleman” were as a matter of fact due to his “involvement” in this affair.
Therefore, the “gentleman” had to be advised to under-take an “inquest and investigation” of all aspects of the Ruma affair.
* See previous document.
—Ed.
Since he agreed to do so, it is up to us to help him; first, because it is unquestionably in the interests of the move-ment to throw full light on the methods used and the web woven by the provocateur Ruma; secondly, because we League members are a little bit to blame for the fact that the League caused the “gentleman” so much trouble, which he may not have fully deserved.
You must agree that it is our right and duty to have reservations as regards X, Y and Z, but X, Y and Z should not be told about them.
Once the “sin” has been committed there is nothing for it, you know, but to own up.
We should not add one mistake to another by saying that it is “none of our business” now, after we ourselves brought things out into the open.

We have received a letter from Kiev criticising the actions of the committee.
It says that (1) the committee is insufficiently informed (there were arrests on the night of December 1, but the committee is unable to ascertain who were arrested and why), and that it is slow in taking action.
(2) A leaflet addressed to the workers should have been put out reporting the student unrest and indicating a course of action to the workers.
The committee agreed that such a leaflet was needed, but did not issue it on time.
We propose to print the letter in our issue No.

In view of this, reply at once whether you have any objections on either score, or send in your own account of the circumstances connected with these facts.

LEITEISEN Once again zur Frage (on the question) of Krichevsky.
G.
V.
says that in the Paris colony it was stubbornly main-tained that this Boris Krichevsky had received a letter of thanks from Millerand (for his contributions to Vorwärts 43) and that he had at one time even boasted about it.
So now that a polemic has started between Vorwärts and Zarya 44 and the question has been put point-blank, it is necessary to exert at once every effort to make a most thorough in-vestigation (trial “by ordeal”) of the affair.
Please tackle the matter at once.
Collect evidence from all witnesses, both those who saw something and those who heard about it, and having done so, write us giving the names of all these witnesses and their testimony.
As a last resort you should turn to Petit, though it would be better not to “scare the quarry” but to catch them before they suspect attack.

Please drop a line to Quelch asking his assistance in a matter on which he has already been approached by a friend of mine (with a letter from Velika Dm.

02 Dear Comrade, We have good reason to fear that our delegate (to the conference) was arrested soon after the conference, before he had time to hand over his office.
45 We therefore ask you to let us know: 1) who besides our delegate was elected to the preparatory (or organising, etc.
) committee? and 2) how can we contact these people (address, key, password, etc.
)? You might write your communication in invisible ink in code, if necessary, giving the key to the bearer of this letter personally.
In general it is most convenient to main-tain contact through the bearer, who can send a wire in emergencies and, if something particularly urgent and pressing happens, take a decision himself.

substitute for the London meeting a trip by Berg and myself to Switzerland for 10 -12 days (sic!) to see some new arriv-als from Russia.
Really, how can anything worth while be accomplished in 10-12 days? For we have to get to know the arrivals thoroughly and individually, and besides we have much to talk over among ourselves.
And we cannot afford to stay long in Switzerland (there’s work to be done).
Lastly, the newcomers must (if they are Iskra supporters) make a study of all (or part) of our correspondence with Russia, and this can be done only in London.
Without such a study of our correspondence the meeting would be point-less and all but useless.
Because of all these reasons I am strongly for a meeting in London.

02 Your communication concerning the “inheritance” re-ceived.
50 We too feel there is much that is “strange and incomprehensible” about this, especially the suggestion thatFyokla * should look for a lawyer.
How could Fyokla do it? And why shouldn’t the heir himself do it? Of course, nothing ventured, nothing gained, and an attempt might be made, but it has to be nevertheless thoroughly considered.
Otherwise we might make a laughing-stock of ourselves by chasing soap-bubbles.
So, do everything possible to investigate the matter and let us know how “the heir can be placed at our disposal”.
Send him abroad, or what? Describe him in detail for us.
Further, why didn’t “your” heir apply to the lawyers acting for the co-heirs? (Needless to say, we cannot afford to spend any money on this.
) It would be very important for us to have good contact directly with the Southern workers’ organisation.
51 Please attend to this and send us as detailed an account of it as possible.

But he has not written .
Let us know how things stand.
We earnestly beg you to contact us directly on all mat-ters of any importance, for passing on information through Berlin, etc.

We believe that in this case too there has been some mix-up.
When giving assignments to people going abroad they must be told not to confine themselves to seeing one or another League member but to contact the Editorial Board with-out fail either in person or by writing themselves (i.
e.
, not leaving it to some League member to do)—registered letters from abroad to the Dietz and other addresses are quite safe.
This is necessary because the members of the League and even members of its administration are scat-tered all over Europe and do not know much about con-tacts with Russia.

02 Dear G.
V.
, The comrade ** we had been waiting for, and whom the old friend 53 who brought you the money knows, arrived here yesterday.
First of all please tell this old friend to come here: he will be needed for joint talks, and the newly-arrived comrade will be here no more than a week and a half or two.
Further, about the new arrival seeing you.
He himself wants to meet you—and it would of course be very useful to the cause if he did.
The only question is whether you should try to come here earlier so as to be sure to find him, or, on the contrary, whether you should wait for him in Geneva, where he is going from here.
Yesterday, before he knew that you too would be here soon, he asked me for a letter to you.
Take this too into consideration: practically all the Ra-bocheye Dyelo people (Martynov, Akimov, Olkhin, Krichev-sky, who is going there, and others) have gathered in Switz-erland (in Montreux, if I’m not mistaken) and our visitor is going there to see them.
The first impression is that he is an Iskra supporter, and Russian friends recommend him as one.
But .

just the same.

Mightn’t the Union crowd (the Rabocheye Dyelo people) feed him a pack of lies? How will it be if he sees them last and is unable perhaps to stand * Postscript to a letter written by Krupskaya.

up to some new gossip, or the like? Therefore we think it might be better if he made your acquaintance and saw you more than once in Geneva.
You could then perhaps talk things over with him both during his meetings with the Union people and after.
Then perhaps whatever new gos-sip there may be could be squashed at once, etc.
Talk this over (with our old friend), decide where to meet the new arrival, and let us have an answer as soon as possible.
The worst thing that could happen would be for you to miss each other.
If you decide to see him over there (but our old friend should come here under all circumstances), we shall write you a detailed letter giving all the information we have about him.

LEITEISEN Dear Leiteisen, Y.
* passed on to me your resolution for the conference on the formulation.
I was quite satisfied with the “Confi-dential Communication”, but the verdict should in my opinion be more emphatic, more categorical.
In particular, I would suggest: Run par.
3 into par.
4, since in itself par.
3 is unfin-ished and pointless.
Add to par.
1: “A thorough examination of all the data relating to Gurovich’s character has convinced the commis-sion that as regards his moral qualities he has nothing in common with a sincere and honest revolutionary.
” To par.
2.
“Consequently, Gurovich did not tell the truth or had to conceal much about his means of livelihood.
” Par.
3.
See above (and par.
4).
Par.
5.
The commission finds that even if in any one of these instances it could be assumed that the gendarmes learned the facts in some other, chance, and unknown man-ner, a comparison of all these instances absolutely rules out such an assumption and allows of no doubt as to Guro-vich’s treachery.
Par.
6 should precede par.
5.
Par.
7.
Insert “unanimously and insistently”.
Add: “The commission finds that this opinion is fully borne out by many of the particulars communicated to it which cannot be made public for reasons of secrecy.
However, the commission * Identity not established.
—Ed.
is informing the revolutionary organisations of some of these facts in a confidential circular letter.
” “Taking into account” should be shifted from the intro-duction to the conclusion, for many of the points are not connected and, taken separately, not too weighty.
Taking into account the aforegoing, the commission holds that the accused Gurovich’s plea that there is no abso-lutely definite evidence and unquestionable proof in no way can serve to exonerate him.
A crime such as secret service in the political police, generally speaking, with the excep-tion of a few isolated cases, cannot be proved by abso-lutely definite evidence and facts concrete enough to be verified by outsiders.
Having examined all the evidence in its entirety and thoroughly verified numerous depositions by revolutionaries, the commission has arrived at the firm conviction that (in detail) Mikhail Ivanovich Gurovich (calling, * etc.
, in detail) was an agent of the secret politi-cal police and operated in St.
Petersburg revolutionary or-ganisations as a provocateur.
The commission therefore urges all honest Russian citizens strictly to boycott Gurovich and to treat him consistently as a traitor and spy.
Those are my comments, dear L.
Please bear in mind that I did not have time to give much thought to the for-mulation (for Y.
wants the manuscript back at once) and that I have only given a rough idea of the lines along which I think it should be amended.
It should make as formi-dable an impression as possible ** ; I would then be in fa-vour of publishing the sentence as a separate leaflet, with a photograph and an introduction from Iskra on the need to wage a systematic struggle against provocateurs and spies, to set up groups to expose, shadow and harass them, and so on.

So you are writing the pamphlet.
I am very glad to hear it.
It would be a very good thing to publish in the feuilleton of Iskra some of the chapters from the pamphlet, including the one you mention.
I expect it next week; otherwise it won’t get into No.

Aren’t you really going to reply to Tarasov (reprint from No.

He needs a good lesson.
Drop me a couple of lines to let me know whether you are writing something, and if so, what and when do you expect to finish, so that I may know what should go into the issue.
I cannot tell whether it is necessary to go to Brussels, for I have no idea of what will be discussed at the confer-ence.
58 We have money now (America has sent 5,000 frs.
), which means that if necessary it is possible to go.
Ginsburg, in my opinion, could take your place only as an exception, for this once, but under no circumstances permanently, for it is very likely that decisive steps will have to be taken there too.
If you decide to go, write or wire about the money.
Levinson is threatening to leave because Lalayants was made manager of the printery and he has quarreled with him.
I wrote Lalayants asking him to “smooth” things out.
Perhaps you too could help to calm down Levinson and im-press it on Lalayants to handle him “with care”.
I am sending to the printers (to Lalayants) the beginning of the translation of Kautsky and a popular pamphlet on army life.
Please look through it at least in proofs.

02 Dear G.
V.
, Just received a letter from you and A.
N.
(how it came to be delivered on a holiday I don’t understand!).
Well, this looks like forced moves, as chessplayers say.
Under the cir-cumstances Bonch of course should be won over to our side, and in all likelihood, everybody will approve of your step (going to Bonch-Bruyevich and “inviting” him to join the League).
But the question is what to do next.
In my opinion, if your talks with Bonch-Bruyevich will be (or were) successful, it is necessary first of all (having assured him that you will sponsor his candidacy in the League and are quite certain of success) to insist on a formal step on his part as well.
In other words, he should officially and publicly announce that there has been a split in Zhizn and that he wishes to go over to Iskra.
Without such a step, I think, his candidacy should not be formally put forward in the League, since Bonch-Bruye-vich officially has not yet left Zhizn and it would be ridicu-lous to accept a person belonging to another organisation.
Moreover, if Bonch-Bruyevich is still only warring with Posse, still only “dividing up” things with him, defending our interests, there is as yet no guarantee of a favourable outcome!! This should not be forgotten.
And if “Bonch is most determined to come over to us”, as A.
N.
writes, insist-ence on your part will in no way be objectionable to him, he will admit himself that so long as he has not officially left Zhizn and made a statement, we, the League, cannot vote for him.
If the split in Zhizn has been finally decidedon and is absolutely inevitable, it is in Bonch’s own interests and his duty to announce this publicly at the earliest date, if only in a letter * to Iskra.
We would publish the letter at once in No.
30 and thereby forestall our opponents and “bind Bonch” (and ourselves by printing the letter ** ).
In-deed, this would be the best way, and the safest, for other-wise we might get into trouble.
.
.
.
And so my opinion is this: I also consider “all kinds of overtures” to Bonch (which A.
N.
writes about and which you are making) necessary, but if he, Bonch, does not take the formal step, and until he takes it, we should confine our-selves to these overtures which do not officially commit the League, and nothing more.
As to what will happen later, no more hitches can be expected.
When Bonch-Bruyevich has left Zhizn and made a public statement, and when his transport group has given its support to this statement, it can easily obtain printed matter from our administration and begin transporting it.
If it becomes necessary to admit this group as well (as you, G.
V.
, assume), we shall then find out all about it from Bonch and discuss whom to accept and how.
You, G.
V.
, write that “we are awaiting instructions for the negotiations with the transport group”.
Let the group first set forth its position in detail, for who can tell what it represents? You have not yet replied, G.
V.

03 Dear Comrade, Your letter of December 21st and all 19 manuscripts re-ceived.
62 I am thinking of giving some of these letters (in particular about sectarians) in early issues of Iskra, perhaps even in No.
31, which will come out in a couple of weeks.
The one thing not quite clear to me is whether to indicate that these are “from the materials of Zhizn”.
On the one hand, it would be the most natural thing to do, that’s how it’s usually done, and nobody in Russia would be puzzled— especially if we also carried an item (or your letter to the editor) about Zhizn ceasing publication.
On the other hand, it appears from your letter that the Zhizn organisation did not want to pass the materials on to Iskra and that you have done so on your own initiative.
If that is so, do you wish the materials printed without any comment or indication of the source? Kindly let me know how things stand and also your opinion on how best to present the material.
Please reply to the following address, which I would ask you not to give to anyone else so that it should be used by you only: Mr.
Jacob Richter.

03 We do not have the rest of the pamphlets (of those you asked for), could not find them.
Return the “Young Revolutionary” manuscript after show-ing it to Plekhanov (or even without showing it to him).
Could you write a paragraph, article or feuilleton for Iskra on the 25th anniversary of the death of Nekrasov? It would be a good thing to print something.
Write whether you will do it.
As regards Bonch, the letter and the 19 manuscripts from Zhizn he has sent here largely meet my wishes.
It was just this kind of formal move and by no means a “renunciation” (“renunciation” of what??) that I suggested we should strive for without considering it a conditio sine qua.
(But Posse’s intriguing should have been brought out into the open, and it was precisely against Posse and not against Bonch that I advised persuading Bonch to take a direct step while provoking Posse to do likewise.
) Best regards.

I have no faith in the transport channels of Zhizn.
We need money badly, of course, and if it were possible to get a large sum, many concessions (not to speak of promises) could be made for the sake of this.

03 Dear G.
V.
, Please pass on the enclosed letter to Lyubov Isakovna; she gave me your address.
The letter is very urgent andimportant, and if she is not there, send it on at once, but read it first yourself.
The point is that there has been a delay with materials about the Rostov strike, and we must hurry with the pamphlet.
If the people from Rostov are in Geneva, please help to hurry them up.
The feuilleton for No.
31 has been set up in type and the proofs sent to you.
If you have important corrections, send them in immediately.
How is the pamphlet coming along? * How long will it be approximately and when do you expect to finish it? We should have at least a rough idea so as to know what to do about the printing.
And what about the continuation of the article “The Pro-letariat and the Peasantry”? Will you finish it with one more feuilleton? Can you send it in for No.
32? (If not, we shall probably have to print “The Problems of the Day” sent by Julius, also against the Socialist-Revolutionaries, specifi-cally concerning the editorial in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya No.
14, and likewise scheduled for several issues.
Because of this it would be very much in place to finish your article first.
) Reply as soon as you can.
How was your lecture on the seventh? How are things with Zhizn? Bonch-Bruyevich sent me the materials—some of them were chosen for No.
31.
He also wrote about trans-port: in this respect, just as I thought, they have practically nothing.
As regards the money and the printing shop, we ought to try to get from them some concrete tokens of their abstract goodwill towards us.

And if you want my opinion, it ought not to be published: there is something not quite right about three men who have fled abroad pro-claiming their solidarity! 64 Why shouldn’t they write to Rostov-on-Don instead, so that the Don Committee (which knows them after all and * Postscript to a letter written by Krupskaya.

Wouldn’t it be better to wait a while for a state-ment of that kind than to print a private letter? Or perhaps the addresses in Rostov don’t function? If they do not, let them give detailed instructions and we shall try to send someone to restore contact.

Pero’s article (it isn’t long) should also go in, I think, for it is a sensible reply to a foolish move.

If you do not agree with the answer, put precisely formu-lated amendments (or a new text) to the vote at once, and tell Olkhin that things are being held up somewhat because of the voting in a “scattered” board.
I am very glad that you are writing an editorial on the “Pseudo-Friends of the Proletariat” and in the introduction to Thun are giving a trouncing to Tarasov (page from the history of socialist thought).
The introduction to Thun is of course the proper place for this.

I saw him the other day and he seemed to agree with me that new subscription lists would be super-fluous.
The League already has subscription lists: theyshould be circulated more widely.
As for the Iskra library, that of course depends on the whole Editorial Board.
Take it up with Plekhanov.
I confess I would not be in favour at present.
In order to start a “library” one must have a spe-cial person to edit it (whom we do not have) or a special staff (which we do not have).
One should have a selection of books and pamphlets of like nature (which we do not have).
To stick Kautsky, Thun, etc.
, into the library would in my view be artificial in the extreme.
What need is there for a “library”? If there are good pam-phlets we can publish them without a library.
In the mean-time there are few pamphlets, and no good translators.
(I am having a hard time redoing translations)—why make loud promises of a “library”?? If you manage to find good translators and select good ma-terial for translation, the undertaking would be very useful and bound to succeed.

03 I am submitting to all members of the Editorial Board a proposal to co-opt “Pero” as a full member of the Board.
(I believe that for co-optation not a majority but a unani-mous decision is needed.
) We are very much in need of a seventh member both be-cause it would simplify voting (six being an even number) and reinforce the Board.
“Pero” has been writing in every issue for several months now.
In general he is working for Iskra most energetically, delivering lectures (and with tremendous success), etc.
For our department of topical articles and items he will be not only very useful but quite indispensable.
He is unquestionably a man of more than average ability, convinced, energetic, and promising.
And he could do a good deal in the sphere of translation and popular literature.
We must draw in young forces: this will encourage them and prompt them to regard themselves as professional writ-ers.
And that we have too few of such is clear—witness 1) the difficulty of finding editors of translations; 2) the shortage of articles reviewing the internal situation, and 3) the shortage of popular literature.
It is in the sphere of popular literature that “Pero” would like to try his hand.
Possible arguments against: 1) his youth; 2) his early (perhaps) return to Russia; 3) a pen (without quotation marks) * with traces of feuilleton style, too pretentious, etc.
Ad 1) “Pero” is suggested not for an independent post, but for the Board.
In it he will gain experience.
He un-doubtedly has the “intuition” of a Party man, a man of our trend; as for knowledge and experience these can be acquired.
That he is hardworking is likewise unquestion-able.
It is necessary to co-opt him so as finally to draw him in and encourage him.
Ad 2) If “Pero” is initiated in all aspects of our work he may not leave so soon.
And if he goes, organisational links with the Board and subordination to it are not a minus but a tremendous plus.
Ad 3) Stylistic shortcomings are not a serious defect.
They will be ironed out.
At present he accepts “corrections” in silence (and not too readily).
In the Board there will be de-bates, things will be put to the vote, and the “instructions” will acquire a more definitive and imperative form.
Therefore, I propose 1) that all six members of the Editorial Board vote on co-opting “Pero” as a full member; 2) if he is accepted, to tackle the final settlement of rela-tionships and voting procedures in the Editorial Board, and to draft precise rules.
This is necessary for us and important for the congress.
* “Pero” (meaning Pen) was the pseudonym used by Trotsky.
—Ed.
P.
S.
I consider it extremely inconvenient and awkward to put off the co-opting, for I can see that “Pero” is already quite annoyed (he has not of course openly said so) with being left hanging “in the air” and treated, so it seems to him, as a “youngster”.
If we do not accept “Pero” at once and he leaves in, say, a month for Russia, I am certain he will take it as a sign that we simply do not want him on the editorial staff.
We might lose him, and that would be very bad.

Dear Friend, I am greatly distressed by your long silence.
I can under-stand very well why you have no desire to take up the pen, how difficult, if not impossible, it is to write about all sorts of petty matters, but you mustn’t forget after all that these (often absurd) petty matters beset us from other sources.
You really must write a few lines, to give at least a general idea of your attitude, otherwise you put us too in an awkward position.
We hear from all sides about discord in the O.
C.
, about the quarrel with Yuri, the quarrel about Liza, and so on.
Of course I listen very unwillingly to all this and shall never (as far as I am concerned) allow any action to be taken until I hear from you or see you, but how much pleasanter to have a line from you.
For months there has been nothing! So, I shall await news, and as for myself, let me say this: it seems to me (I cannot be sure of course) that you have been carried away a little in the matter of Liza (an ineffi-cient person that Liza, rushes about for no good reason in-stead of attending to her business), that the charges against Yuri are exaggerated, that the most, the very most impor-tant thing is to hurry with the congress, to hurry by all pos-sible means.
How is Kurz? I learned about his state of health recently and realised I had no grounds whatever for being dissatisfied with him (please convey this to him, if you can, but let me add that he too is to blame for his silence).
How are you getting on with Jacques and Kostya? What nonsense Jacques preaches against the two centres! Can’t you prevail upon that by no means stupid but slow-thinking lad? How’s Medvezhonok? What advice did you give him? Very best regards.
Yours.

03 Dear Comrade, The C.
C.
leaves it to the editors of the Central Organ to issue instructions to Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich as regards both the text of the statement “From the Editors” in his paper 75 and the nature of the literary supervision to be exer-cised.
Both questions in our opinion are within the compe-tence of the C.
O.
and we cannot undertake to issue instruc-tions on them to Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich.
The editors should have taken up the mediocrity of the articles and Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich’s inexperience not with the C.
C.
but with Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich himself.
The C.
C.
will of course receive the proofs and will do its best to advise in particularly important matters.
We do not think the question of the text of the statement is very im-portant, but “special supervision” by the C.
O.
over a publi-cation like Bonch-Bruyevich’s paper would, in our opinion, be useful.
We shall consider the question of most convenient type.
We have left it to Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich himself to hand in the copy to the printers if the editors of the C.
O.
have no objections to this.

VILENSKY To Comrade Ilya, manager of the Party printing shop, and Party compositors Irrespective of the legitimacy of Comrade Glebov’s claims (I have handed over all materials relating to the matter to Comrades Olin, Bonch-Bruyevich and Lyadov), I consider it necessary to state that under all circumstances the man-ager and compositors are obliged to turn over the Ryadovoi and Galyorka pamphlet * to the authors for the following reasons: 1) the printing of the pamphlet is paid for in full by the authors and hence it is their exclusive property; 2) authorisation to set up and print it in the Party print-ing shop was given by agents of the C.
C.
long before Com-rade Glebov appeared on the scene with his “reforms”.
Subsequent decisions, even if they were taken by properly constituted meetings of the C.
C.
, in no way invalidate legitimate authorisation given by persons acting as agents of the C.
C; 3) the authors do not insist that it be indicated in the pamphlet that it was printed in the Party printing shop.
* See previous document.

I would consider refusal to turn over the pamphlet at once to the authors to be nothing but direct seizure of other people’s property.

MAKADZYUB MAO * 85 Private, to Anton Dear Comrade, Please acknowledge receipt of this letter if only in a cou-ple of words.
I am not certain that your address is still good but Zemlyachka has asked to write her through you.
Besides, it would be desirable to start regular correspondence.
This is extremely important.
To make sure that your letters do not accidentally get into the wrong hands, write on top “Private, to L.
” or “Private, to N.
K.
” Could you let us know the whereabouts of Tomich (= Emmanuel= Emma)? We have lost touch with him.
We sent him several letters but do not know whether they reached him.
If you happen to know his address.
please let us have it.
The Declaration of the C.
C.
has evidently not been too kindly received by the Majority committees.
** In the Cauca-sus it caused an outburst of indignation, in Odessa, Niko-layev and Yekaterinoslav it met with strong disapproval, and our old comrades have been sending in indignant reso-lutions from prisons.
.
.
.
The “conciliators” have succeeded in deceiving some people by their fables about peace prevail-ing in the Party.

—Ed.
are said to have withdrawn their resolutions on the congress, but as soon as they learn what the real state of affairs is they will of course again insist on its convocation.
Incidentally, I do not know how much truth there is to the rumours that the above-mentioned committees have withdrawn their resolutions.
The “conciliators” do not always accurately enough pass on information, and the Editorial Board, on the pretext of preserving peace, does not print resolutions on the congress adopted by the committees (St.
Petersburg, Yekaterinoslav).
Besides the ten points there are several more which are in no way secret but which the “collegium” (taking advantage of the arrest of some of its staunchest members and unlawfully expelling one member who does not share its views * ) has decided to conceal from the mem-bers of the Party to avoid unnecessary fuss.
These include the decision to dissolve the Southern Bureau 78 and not to publish Council minutes unfavourable to the Minority, and the prohibition of the printing of Lenin’s writings in the Party printery without permission from an agent specially appointed by the “collegium”.
.
.
.
The Majority has decided not to permit the opinion of the Party to be misrepresented or to allow itself to be silenced; it is sponsoring the publi-cation of Majority writings; the publishing has been un-dertaken by Bonch-Bruyevich.
We shall not be short of literary forces, the only hitch may be finances.
Galyorka’s pamphlet Down with Bonapartism! (concerning the C.
C.
Declaration) and a collection of articles by Galyorka and Ryadovoi have come out, and a popular pamphlet on so-cialism by Ryadovoi and many other things are ready for the press.
Pass all this on to Zemlyachka if you know her address, and also inform her that both of her letters have been received.
Acknowledge receipt of this letter without delay.

LEIBOVICH * Private, to Yevsei (Malyutkin) from Lenin 20/IX.
Dear Comrade, Your letter written in the Gritsko code received; we de-ciphered it with much difficulty since you went by another edition.
We are using the same code.
The conciliators here are engaged in liquidating the Ma-jority.
When it informed the committees of the peace re-stored in the Party, the C.
C.
forgot to add that it had itself gone over to the Minority and begun to hound the Majority.
Besides the points made public in C.
C.
resolutions, there are also some which are not to be publicised, not because of any considerations of secrecy, but just to avoid tempta-tion.
The C.
C.
has decided: to dissolve the Southern Bu-reau for agitation in favour of the congress, to disband the forwarding office, to apologise to the book-stitchers, not to publish the minutes of the Council for they discred-it the Minority and show that before beginning agitation for the congress the Majority (firm) proposed honest peace and insisted on the boycott being ended on both sides while the Central Organ replied to this proposal with ridicule , to institute a special censorship of writings by the Majori-ty—a special censor has been named from among the con-ciliators to decide whether one or another piece written by Lenin can be printed, and Lenin has been deprived of * Written by Krupskaya on Lenin’s instructions.
—Ed.
all the rights of a representative abroad.
More, the C.
C.
is arranging a conference with the Minority, completely ignor-ing the Majority.
The Minority of course is rejoicing and lauding the C.
C.
The composition of the C.
C.
has changed, two members have been arrested, two have resigned, and one member has been expelled completely unlawfully.
The C.
C.
, which in April took the Majority viewpoint, now finds that the C.
O.
is up to the mark.
Yet, if in the beginning there were no differences of principle, now there are plenty.
To justify itself, the Minority is smearing the old Iskra.
It claims (Dan’s report to the international congress, and Trotsky’s pamphlet) that the old Iskra was not so much a Social-Democratic as a democratic organ, that it was con-cerned not with organising the working class but with organ-ising the intelligentsia, that Axelrod did not take part in it because it was not really a Social-Democratic organ.
Only the new Iskra has put forward the slogan “to the masses”, and so on and so forth.
It is difficult to recount all the non-sense they are now spouting, speculating on the ignorance of the public, on its lack of knowledge of the history of the movement.
The C.
C.
is not in the least perturbed by all this and is vastly tickled at having won the forgiveness of the C.
O.
by its declaration * .
.
.
.
On the pretext of preserv-ing the peace in the Party the C.
O.
does not print resolutions passed by committees in favour of the congress, for example, the Yekaterinoslav, Petersburg, Moscow, Nizhni-Novgorod and Kazan resolutions.
Of the 20 committees in Russia (those with a vote), 12 (the St.
Petersburg, Tver, Tula, Moscow, Siberian, Tiflis, Baku, Batum, Yekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, Odessa and Nizhni-Novgorod committees) have already declared for the congress, besides which the Riga and Kazan committees are for it.
But the new C.
C.
has announced that the Samara, Orel-Bryansk and Smolensk committees are now also in-cluded among those with a vote.
These committees take a conciliatory stand and conduct negligible work.
.
.
.
In view of the aforesaid, the Majority has decided not to allow itself to be silenced and is printing its writings independently, the publishing having been undertaken by * A reference to the Central Committee’s “July Declaration”.
—Ed.
Bonch-Bruyevich.
79 The Council, which said nothing when Ryazanov and Akimov were putting out their pamphlets, has made a fuss and is insisting that the line “Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party” should not figure on the pamphlets.
Bonch-Bruyevich editions of the pamphlet Down with Bonapartism! by Galyorka and a collection of articles by Galyorka and Ryadovoi, Our Misunderstand-ings, have already come out.
The pamphlet The Fight for a Congress, containing resolutions adopted by the committees, including the Riga resolution, will be published shortly.
The Riga people say that they want to see the Party insti-tutions in the hands of the Majority as the Congress decided, and will press for this at the coming congress too, but that they find it necessary that certain rights be guaranteed to the Minority.
The Riga resolution has already been sub-scribed by the Petersburg and Moscow committees.
That’s how things stand.
Bear in mind that we have already been dissolved, 80 and therefore if you want your letters to reach the right address, write on top: private, for Sharko.
I am sending you new postal addresses.
We hope you will give every support to the Majority publications.
It would be a good thing if a special resolu-tion were adopted on this question.
Send us letters and materials of all kinds.
Your previous letter still remains undeciphered.
Let us know what key you used, for although it is old by now, it interests us nevertheless.
Do you know what is happen-ing in Yekaterinoslav and Odessa? The Minority is spread-ing a rumour that the Odessa Committee has withdrawn its resolution on the congress.
We haven’t heard from the spot for a long time, but the report does not ring true.
Let us know how things are with Gritsko.
Greetings.

LENGNIK, AND OTHERS * 14/X.
Our very dear Friends, We sent you some three weeks ago a letter through Irina.
** We heartily endorse your plan.
Write if you have a chance.
Bonch and Lenin have undertaken the publishing end.
Down with Bonapartism!, Our Misunderstandings and To the Party have already appeared, and On the New Road, The Fight for a Congress and On Socialism are coming out shortly.
According to our estimates 14 committees, 11 of them with full voting rights, have already declared for the congress.
All the attempts of the C.
O.
, the C.
C.
and the Council to hold up the agitation for the congress have proved fruitless.
The C.
C.
saw that the Majority also has to be reckoned with and is evidently ready to make concessions * Written by Krupskaya on Lenin’s instructions.
—Ed.
** See present volume, Document 88.
—Ed.
With the Minority too they haven’t been able to achieve full unity.
In a word, they have got into a mess.
Formerly the C.
O.
played the committees off against the C.
C.
and baited the C.
C.
, now it is playing the periphery off against the committees and trying to prove that the opinion of the committees is not the opinion of the Party, and that strict-ly speaking there is no Party.
They have done everything they could to split the Party and now they shout that the Party does not exist.
The position of the C.
C.
has untied our hands and life now is far easier than before.
Of course there is some had news, for example, Brodyaga has gone with the Minority, so has Samsonov, but that can’t be helped.
We shall go on working and upholding our views, and time will tell.
A new pamphlet by Trotsky came out recently, under the editorship of Iskra, as was announced.
This makes it the “Credo” as it were of the new Iskra.
The pamphlet is a pack of brazen lies, a distortion of the facts.
And this is done under the editor-ship of the C.
O.
The work of the Iskra group is vilified in every way, the Economists, it is alleged, did far more, the Iskra group displayed no initiative, they gave no thought to the proletariat, were more concerned with the bourgeois intelligentsia, introduced a deadly bureaucracy everywhere —their work was reduced to carrying out the programme of the famous “Credo”.
The Second Congress was, in his words, a reactionary attempt to consolidate sectarian methods of organisation, etc.
The pamphlet is a slap in the face both for the present Editorial Board of the C.
O.
and for all Party workers.
Reading a pamphlet of this kind you can see clearly that the “Minority” has indulged in so much lying and falsehood that it will be incapable of producing anything viable, and one wants to fight, here there is some-thing worth fighting for.
Kol’s wife is well, she is in Yekaterinoslav.
Warm greetings to all of you.

RADCHENKO ** From Lenin, private, to Arkady, the Urals 28/X.
Dear Comrade, Your letter received.
Please send us the resolution adopt-ed by the Urals Committee.
The Minority maintains that the Urals Committee came out against the congress, and Iskra has reported that it declared for peace in the Party, voicing support for the actions of the Central Committee.
Everybody wants peace in the Party, and what is at issue now is how to resolve the crisis experienced by the Party, * See this volume, Document 89.
—Ed.
** Written by Krupskaya on Lenin’s instructions.
—Ed.
through the Party, i.
e.
, by convening the congress, or through a private deal with the Minority.
The Central Committee came out in its declaration in favour of the latter.
Consequently, the Iskra statement can be under-stood only in the sense that the Urals Committee has decided against the congress.
Use invisible ink, and address your letters “To Lenin, private”.
Your letter shows that you are completely uninformed about the state of affairs in the Party.
I shall give you a brief outline.
(See also letter to the Siberian League.
) So far the following committees have declared for the congress: Siberian, Caucasian Union Committee (after the resolution given in the supplement to Nos.
73-74), Tiflis, Baku, Min-grelia-Imeretia, Odessa, Nikolayev, Yekaterinoslav, Pe-tersburg, Moscow, Tver, Northern Committee (after the C.
C.
declaration), Nizhni-Novgorod, Kazan, Riga, and Tula (13 organisations with full rights)—formerly this would have been enough, but the Council has given the right of vote to another five committees (Smolensk (?), Orel-Bryansk (?), Samara, Astrakhan, and one more, evidently Kremen-chug).
All these are committees which we know in advance will declare against the congress.
Moreover, the Council recognises only those committees as having come out for the congress whose resolutions it has received (the resolu-tions of the Nikolayev, Northern and Nizhni-Novgorod committees have probably gone astray).
Further, confir-mation of the resolutions is required every two months, which the committees, owing to irregular receipt of Iskra and absence of regular correspondence, may not know.
The resolutions must be signed by the members of the commit-tees so that no one might vote twice for the congress (only Council members may vote three times against the congress: in the Council, in the Editorial Board, and in the League).
In view of the stand taken by the Council, the C.
C.
and the Central Organ (to hound those conducting agitation for the congress), the demand for signatures has a very definite purpose.
The object of all this is to hamper agitation for the congress.
But since the committees are taking a very definite stand, the Minority has now launched an attack against them.
Everything is being done to undermine theprestige of the committees in the eyes of the local communi-ties and the workers, who are being literally incited against the committees.
Special efforts are being made to influence the periphery.
How this disorganises work is easy to imagine.
The Minority is now laying siege to Petersburg.
Such is the situation in the Party.
Not a very happy one, needless to say.
Send us a secret address for contacts, people often go from here and may also go to the Urals.

BOGDANOV * November 2 Your letter of October 9 (22) received.
The undeciphered letter has been repeated.
Not a word about the light-minded Minonosets.
To what address was the money sent? Lidin, Alexeyev, Afanasyeva have left, no news from Popova.
Now for some semi-foreign, semi-Russian news.
The Bonch Bruyevich and Lenin Publishers are very slow, pamphlets are coming out in driblets.
The long-promised pamphlet The Fight for a Congress has only just come out.
The hitch there is partly due to the printery, but mainly to lack of money.
In general the money question is most desperate, for sending people to Russia (the demand is enormous) and transport cost a great deal.
Every effort should be made to obtain a big sum.
This is now the only hitch, everything else we have.
Without a big sum we are doomed to the intolerable, * Written jointly with Krupskaya.
Passages by Krupskaya are in brevier.
—Ed.
depressing vegetable existence we are leading here.
We must get that money if it kills us.
For Russia is organising and expects decisive steps from us! The Riga Committee has adopted a resolution supporting this publishing business, and so have the Odessa, Nikolayev and Yekaterinoslav committees.
Many people are asking why the Majority did not ask permission, but they completely ignore the actual situation and forget that Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin acted as private individuals and not in the name of a group, though in Russia this was not understood and a resolution was adopted in support of the group headed by Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin, which is absurd.
The C.
C.
refused to transport Majority literature on the grounds that it was not Party literature.
There is virtually a complete split in the Party.
The Minority and the C.
C.
have already made a deal and they are pursuing a com-mon line consisting in machinations against the congress and liqui-dating the committees “from below”.
This is done by sending into the militant Majority committees Minority groups which lay siege to the committee, carry on agitation in order to undermine confidence in it among the public, among the workers, and especially in the pe-riphery.
Then, after the ground has been prepared with the aid of the periphery, they kick up a row in the committee demanding its sur-render.
This is what is happening now, with the benevolent partici-pation of the C.
C.
, in Petersburg.
The C.
C.
is pursuing a hypocriti-cal policy towards the Majority committees, assuring them that if there is no reconciliation with the Minority, which, they say, is quite possible (there’s hypocrisy for you!), the C.
C.
will call the congress, that the C.
C.
is not against the congress and has not changed its views, that it considers it possible to make a deal with the Editorial Board of the Central Organ since they do not consider it the organ of the Party but of a group.
Although it is a Majority C.
C.
, the fact is that at the Con-gress and after it, the only consideration in the elections to the C.
C.
was whether X or Y was a good practical worker; the Congress gave the C.
C.
no ligne de conduite, * and hence it can lay down its own line and is not obliged to adhere to the Majority stand.
In a word, they talk any amount of nonsense.
In Russia there is strong resentment against them.
The Nikolayev Odessa and Yekaterinoslav committees called a conference and adopt-ed a resolution.
.
.
.
The Majority participants answered them as fol-lows.
.
.
.
It is proposed to elect candidates from a few of our own com-mittees, then announce the formation of a Bureau of the Majority Com-mittees, and after that make the rounds of the rest of the committees inviting them to join in and add one or two of their own candidates to the list.

GOLDENBERG To Meshkovsky 2/XI.
Dear Comrade, We have learned that our letter has reached you, the same letter was sent to Maria Petrovna’s address.
Please ask her to acknowledge receipt.
We are impatiently await-ing your reply, do not put it off too long, it is most important now to keep up a regular correspondence.
I repeat the post-al addresses.
All letters and leaflets can be sent to these addresses.
In our next letter we shall send you one more address.
Iskra No.
75 reports that the Saratov Committee has declared for peace in the Party and “voiced support for the actions of the C.
C.
” Everybody wants peace in the Party, the only question being whether it is permissible for the C.
C.
to make a deal with the Minority on the basis of an understanding that the C.
C.
will work against the congress in every way.
The decisions of the Council published in the supplement to Nos.
73-74 afford an idea of what this deal has led to.
Iskra no longer prints resolutions of Majority committees or else gives them space in the supplement, which is not even put on sale (after No.
74 resolutions on the congress were received from the Caucasus: from the Caucasian Union Committee, and the Tiflis, Baku and Mingrelia-Imeretia committees), and there are also resolutions from the Odessa (37 signatures) and Moscow prisons.
Iskra has started a column in favour of Party peace where resolutions against the congress are printed.
It is somehow unbelievable that the Saratov Committee should have come out against the congress and for the C.
C.
declaration.
Please send as soon as possible all the resolu-tions of the Saratov Committee, and let us know what sort of an organ Svobodnoye Slovo is, the Minority says it is in possession of all the contacts.
Please send us all the commit-tee’s publications for recent months, or at least a list of them, and let us know how the work is going, how it has been organised, whether they have literature, and whether there are contacts with the peasants.
Send us material for publication, make a special effort to get people in the pe-riphery to write; after all there is plenty to write about.
Can you connect us with Astrakhan and the Urals? All the best.

To “Pyatnitsa”, private, from Lenin Dear Comrade, Our mutual friend * has told me about the letters you have at your disposal 83 (letters from a C.
C.
member abroad to C.
C.
members in Russia where it is stated that the Mi-nority abroad has become high-handed and that the resolu-tion of the 22 ** unquestionably reflects the real will of the Party).
I think you ought to send these letters to me here at once.
* Meaning Rozalia Zemlyachka.

** See present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
452-59.
—Ed.
In the first place, I am a member of the C.
C.
and there-fore have every right to be informed of the correspondence between a C.
C.
member abroad and members in Russia, all the more since this correspondence deals with the stand taken by the Minority, a question which concerns the whole Party.
Surely you will not help C.
C.
members who have defected to the Minority to conceal from the Party (and even from other C.
C.
members) the real state of affairs? Secondly, the letters show that some members of the C.
C.
(Glebov, Konyagin and Nikitich) are simply not tell-ing the truth when they speak in their letter to the Russian committees of the conciliatory attitude of the Minority abroad.
Once we have declared open war on this Bonapart-ism, this deception of the Party (Galyorka in his pamphlet declared this war on behalf of all of us), it is our direct duty to expose before the Party any deception on the part of C.
C.
members.
If, having in our possession proof of such de-ception, we failed to bring this proof to the attention of the Party, we would not he doing our duty to the Party.
If we speak of Bonapartism in the press and from the public plat-form and at the same time miss the opportunity to offer documentary proof of that Bonapartism, we will be simply windbags.
After all, we use the word Bonapartism not as invective, as Martov and Plekhanov have used it.
It is sometimes said that private letters should not be used in political struggle.
This is not so.
When private letters reveal abuses by Party functionaries, such letters should by all means be used.
Plekhanov used private letters in his Vademecum * not even in relation to functionaries.
Besides, the letters in question are not private letters at all, they are the correspondence of C.
C.
members on C.
C.
business.
And I, as a member of the C.
C.
, and you, as an agent of the C.
C.
, are in duty bound to foil this attempt to conceal the truth from the Party.
For all these reasons I consider it imperative that you at once send me these letters or, at any rate, complete copies of them.
Of course, parts of them are confidential, and we shall never make these public.
But that which concerns * Handbook.
—Ed.
the interests of the entire Party and contains nothing con-fidential must be divulged.
How to do this and when, is something we shall think about here.
Reply to this letter without fail and as soon as possible.
It doesn’t matter how badly you write Russian.
You can even write in Yiddish if you wish.
But let it be immediately.
If you do not agree with me about sending the letters, we shall all have to ask you to come here as soon as possible, within a few days.
This is such an important matter that it must be discussed and decided at all costs.
Best regards, Yours, N.

Dear Comrade, Both copies of your resolution received.
They were not turned over to the Central Organ because recently the fol-lowing happened.
The Nikolayev Committee sent a resolu-tion to be forwarded to Iskra, which was done.
The resolu-tion was returned by Martov accompanied by gross abuse.

that there was no committee in Nikolayev and that the resolution had therefore obviously been written by some frauds and impostors.
Since the resolution bore no signa-tures, no date, and no indication of the attitude of the periphery to it, it was meaningless, he said, and he, Martov, even refused to forward it to the Central Organ, declaring he was sick and tired of all this fabrication of false resolu-tions.
The same fate evidently awaits the Tver resolution.
We shall print it in a Majority leaflet.
Please let us know how things are going.
Did you receive the Iskra letter to the Party organisa-tions concerning the Zemstvo campaign? In it, the editors in their striving for a “new and higher type” talked a lot of nonsense, including the absurdity that the workers should not frighten away the liberals but act so as not to cause panic among them.
The letter has caused a heated debate.
Lenin replied to it in his pamphlet The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan.
* Please let us have addresses to which we can send litera-ture.
The addresses you sent the resolution to are quite alright.
A certain Rogova will come to you from Perm.
She is said to be a good worker.
We do not know her personally but perhaps she will be of use to you.
Her status is illegal, please help her to get settled.

Dear Comrades, Both your letters, of the 23rd and the 28th, received; the first (with the statistics and addresses) got into the hands of the Minority and was delivered to us only today.
We have made out the addresses, the address for literature will be used at once.
Your resolution in favour of the con-gress was received and forwarded to the Central Organ.
We have not heard of any recount of votes, and there hardly will be one.
The resolution of the Nikolayev Committee was received recently and forwarded to the Central Organ.
Martov re-turned it with gross abuse, saying that the Central Organ and the C.
C.
knew for certain that there was no committee in Nikolayev (a downright lie, for the C.
C.
went with its declaration to the Nikolayev Committee and knows very well that the persons who signed the resolution are in the Nikolayev Committee), that the resolution had been sent by some impostors and frauds who had forged it.
.
.
.
The resolution of the Caucasian Union Committee in favour of the congress was not printed, but another .
.
.
against the congress was printed.
Iskra said that the Saratov, Samara, Urals and Astrakhan committees had endorsed the C.
C.
policy (the resolutions were not given), but the very same day the issue came out we received a letter from the Urals saying they had not heard from the C.
C.
for several months and that they did not know in general whether the Party existed at all.
Plekhanov is openly saying that there is not going to be any congress.
.
.
.
As for the C.
C.
, it hypocriti-cally declares that now it is not against the congress, but that it is necessary to make sure that the congress will real-ly represent the opinion of the Party.

The C.
C.

holing the committees’ resolutions, and in its letter to Party comrades it says: “now that the Party has declared for us”.
.
.
.
The committees have asked the C.
C.
for Majority litera-ture but the C.
C.
has refused to ship it, claiming firstly that it is not Party literature, and secondly, that it cannot con-tribute in any way to developing the class-consciousness of the proletariat.
What hypocrisy! I suppose Trotsky’s new pamphlet issued by the new Iskra and therefore to some ex-tent representing its “Credo” does contribute a great deal to the development of the class-consciousness of the prole-tariat.
.
.
.
The pamphlet declares that there is a wide gulf between the old and the new Iskra, that the Congress was a reactionary attempt to perpetuate sectarian methods of struggle, that the old Iskra did not care about the prole-tariat, that the Iskra supporters call the proletariat block-heads, etc.
, etc.
No wonder Struve praised the Minority tendencies as vital.
.
.
(see Lenin’s leaflet “An Obliging Lib-eral” * ).
Did you get the Iskra letter to all Party organisa-tions on the Zemstvo campaign? In its striving for a new, “higher” type of propaganda and agitation, Iskra talks a lot of nonsense, going so far as to say that demonstrations should be organised with caution so as not to cause a panic among the Zemstvo people.
Lenin has replied to this letter in his pamphlet The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan.
”** Now that the C.
C.
has made a deal with the Central Organ not to allow the congress to be held, it will be postponed indefinitely.
Nevertheless the Majority has resolved to fight for it, but it can succeed only if it is fully united and properly organised.
Well, that’s all for the time being.

—EdIt is increasingly clear that the Council will not allow the congress to be held on any account.
Plekhanov says so quite openly: no congress! At best the Central Organ throws the committees’ resolutions into the waste-paper basket or returns them with gross abuse, as was done in the case of the Niko-layev Committee, which sent in a resolution in favour of the congress, but not in the form prescribed by the Council, for which the authors of the resolution were branded as frauds, impostors, forgers of resolutions.
.

To compel the Council to call the congress, the Majority must organise properly, as Lenin wrote in his last letter.

We do not have the reso-lution of the Baku Committee or the resolution of the con-ference of Caucasian committees which we have been told was sent to us.
As regards the “statement” the following must be said.
Some time ago (in the summer) a detailed letter was received from the C.
C.
representative in the Caucasus concerning the Minority affair.
The letter was immediately forwarded to the Central Organ, which means that the Council was well aware of his opinion, as was C.
C.
member Glebov, who took part in investigating the matter.
The Majority is putting out a pamphlet, The Council Against the Party, which will examine the matter in detail on the basis of the opinion of the C.

representative in the Caucasus.
86 Please let us know what size parcels sent from Sosnowice should be.
Reply as soon as possible.
A violent controversy is now under way between the editors of Iskra and the Majority on the question of the Zemstvo campaign.
The editors circulated an absurd letter “for Party members only” in which they thoroughly confused the issue of the attitude towards the Zemstvo people.
Lenin replied with the pamphlet The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan.
* There is nothing confidential about the ques-tion, and it is important enough to warrant open discussion.
Therefore demand that the Editorial Board’s letter on the Zemstvo be reprinted for everybody to read.
For it is disgraceful to say one thing in Iskra and another in a letter to Party members.
This is a matter of concern for all.

LEITEISEN 12/XII.
04 Dear Leiteisen, Today we finally, and practically, settled the question of the organ.
We propose to begin publishing as of January 1-10; the size will be half the old Iskra (something like Osvobozhdeniye)—100,000 characters, or roughly four pages of the old Iskra.
It should come out fortnightly, and still better, weekly.
87 The cost will be about 400 frs.
an issue.
For one issue we have the money, and for the rest—promises.
.
.
.
This is on the short side, and the initial period is especially hard going.
Because of this, remembering your offer, I turn to you: consider the question thoroughly and write how much you could give to help; we shall count on you in an emergen-cy (besides promises of a “big sum” from Russia, we have some “prospects” of getting a few hundred francs here, and then, apart from this, so far in the past three or four months there has always been a thousand or two francs available for pamphlets).
It would be good to know the maximum we can be sure of getting from you in an emergency, when we are unable to raise money anywhere and the paper is threat-ened with death.
Now about writing for us.
We count on having you as our permanent correspondent covering the French move-ment.
We should carry 8,000-12,000 characters once in two weeks about French socialism and working-class movement, etc.
Let us have something without fail by January 1.
Further.
Since you are au courant as regards French political life (as you told me yourself) and are in a position to follow the latest literature, sometimes better than from Paris, perhaps you could keep us posted on, and at times obtain and forward to us, or review, etc.
, interesting new books, articles and items published in journals, and the like.
The foreign press now writes a great deal about Russia.
There is much that never comes to our knowledge; you see far more newspapers, journals, books.
For instance, I recently happened to read about the book Rouble et roublards by a French correspondent who fled from Russia after the outbreak of the war.
It would be extremely im-portant for the paper to keep abreast of such new books and to carry articles about them.
Please give this serious thought and render us all-round literary assistance.
Draw our attention to interesting new publications and send us items and extracts from socialist newspapers and journals which we could translate for the paper, etc.
For you pro-bably follow practically the entire French (and Belgian? * ) socialist press, don’t you? Bear in mind, then, that we are seriously counting on you.
You must come here on Christmas.
It is most important to talk things over, at leisure, thoroughly, concretely.
Did you write Plekhanov about the “Zemstvo” views of the new Iskra? Their letter is stupid, isn’t it? 88 And Staro-ver in No.
78 is simply delightful.
Yours, N.
Lenin By the way.
Could you send me material to refute Starover’s reference to Clemenceau? For it is incorrect.

KAMENEV Via Caucasian Union Council To Yuri Dear Comrade, Many thanks for your letter and the beginning (the end has not yet reached us) of the article “ Iskra ’ s Military Campaign”.
I was especially happy to receive your letter since we hear so rarely from Russia, so rarely do people write us not “in duty bound” but to exchange ideas.
Please write more often and collaborate more closely with our new organ, which we shall begin publishing in the near future(we are sending a detailed letter about the paper to the Cau-casian League with a request that it be passed on to you too * ; ask for it and bring it to the attention of as many comrades sharing the Majority views as you possibly can).
I would say that your article is unquestionable evidence of your literary ability, and I ask you not to give up writing.
It is quite possible that even this article could be adapted and revised for publication (in its present form, as you remarked yourself, it is somewhat out of date).
Try to answer this letter as soon as possible and to establish direct contact with us by letter, to correspond regularly.
This is of utmost importance considering the scanty flow of literary contribu-tions from Russia.
Write also about local affairs, and what Majority literature you have seen.

To the Caucasian Bureau Dear Comrades, Your statement received.
We do not know what the bureau wrote.
We shall communicate what we know.
Some time ago we forwarded to you the resolutions of the confer-ence of Southern committees and the reply of the partici-pants in the conference of the 22.
A slight correction has to be made in your assertion that the Southern committees proposed that the group of 22 appoint a Bureau of the Majority Committees from among its members.
It was pro-posed that the participants in the conference of the 22 name the comrades they thought best suited for the bureau.
From the reply of the participants in the conference of the 22 it can be seen that they in no way considered themselves empowered to “appoint” anyone; instead they put forward a list of nominees and asked the committees to introduce changes or additions in it as they saw fit.
You have received that letter, haven’t you? The Southern comrades also took the same view, and, not agreeing with the list proposed, nominated Ryadovoi and Zemlyachka for the Bureau (a minor point: all the nominees are in Russia with the ex-ception of two, and of these one has just come from Russia and is going there again).
So far as we know, their nomina-tion coincided with the choice of the Caucasian Bureau.
But these persons did not feel they had the right to take any steps before the conference of the Northern committees, which has already taken place.
Here’s its resolution.
* Thus 13 committees (4 Caucasian&3 Southern&6 Northern) have declared for the congress and the establishment of the Bureau of the Majority Committees.
As you can see, every-thing is being done to enable the committees in Russia to come to an agreement.
Other committees besides the thir-teen have also declared for the congress; the Central Commit-tee itself admits that 16 have already declared for the * The text of the resolution is not given.
—Ed.
congress, but it now maintains that 19 are needed (this is what the Odessa Committee was told).
In any case the Majority committees should hurry up and organise.
In a few days you will receive documents from which you will see how the C.
C.
negotiations with the Minority began and how they ended: with the retention by the Minority of the autonomy of the technical institutions and the co-opting (so far unofficial) into the C.
C.
of three of the most ardent Mensheviks whose inclusion in the C.
C.
the Minority had insisted on from the very beginning.
The Mensheviks have begun to run things their own way.
The Petersburg business is proof of this.
The workers were eager for a demonstration, the committee set the date for the 28th, but in many districts the organisers were Mensheviks (the Petersburg Committee considered it impossible to exclude the Mensheviks from the work) and they conducted vigorous agitation throughout against the committee.
The C.
C.
did not supply the committee with literature; the Mensheviks had the literature but of course did not give it to the committee, and in their districts they did not prepare for the demonstration.
Three days before the demonstration the Mensheviks disrupted a meeting of the committee and, taking advantage of the absence of three Bolsheviks, called off the demonstration; 15,000 leaflets were burnt, and when the Bolsheviks, horrified, got another meeting together it was already too late, nothing could be done any more, and hardly any workers showed up for the demonstration.
There is seething indignation against the committee, and the Men-sheviks who caused all this mess are breaking away, carry-ing with them nearly all districts, and are receiving sup-port in the form of literature, contacts and money.
Now there are two committees in Petersburg.
Undoubtedly the same will happen in other cities.
The Mensheviks have no scruples and, having seized the C.
C.
, the Central Organ and the Council, will pursue a line which will leave the Majority completely out of the picture.
This is no battle of princi-ples.
It is the most outrageous mockery of the Party and prin-ciples.
This is why we began to publish our own organ.
There is a complete split in the Party and there must be no pro-crastination if we do not wish to reconcile ourselves to the sacrifice of Party principle to clannishness, to absence ofprinciple prevailing in the Party for a long time to come, or its being thrown back to Economism and the Rabocheye Dyelo approach.

have so many serious differences that we must refrain from breeding new ones.
Who has spoken, and where, specially about breaking up anything by force? 91 Nobody, I believe.
It was merely conceded as an inevitable result irrespective of our wishes.
We urged people to go to the meetings even if they had to force their way in in order to propagate our slogans.
I grant that the presentation of ideas was at times clumsy, but to cavil at this would be to repeat the foul methods of the new Iskra.
You of course do not wish to cavil, that is unquestionable.
But you do not in any way prove that there has been “tactlessness”.
And to say that “all tactics should consist in tact” and the like, why, that’s altogether “off the mark”.

The Labour Representation Committee (secretary Mac-Donald), a British proletarian organisation, has sent 6 0 pounds sterling (1,506 francs) * through the editors of Vpe-ryod in aid of the widows and orphans of workers who fell on January 9 (22) in St.
Petersburg.
The editors of Vpe-ryod have forwarded this money to the St.
Petersburg Com-mittee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party with the request that the donation be brought without fail to the attention of all workers’ organisations of our Party without exception (district committees, meetings of organ-isers, factory groups, etc.
) which could themselves help properly to distribute the funds.
It would be desirable that the workers themselves acknowledge the receipt of the money to their British comrades.
Besides the 60 pounds sterling for the victims, the La-bour Representation Committee at the same time sent another 20 pounds sterling to Vperyod to be used for the needs of the uprising.
Now, March 13 (February 28), the editors of Vperyod have received from the same Committee another 90 pounds sterling (about 900 rubles) of which 50 pounds (about 500 rubles) is for aid to the orphans and widows of the workers * About 600 rubles.

Plekhanov.
The head of our for-warding office has written him that we expect half of this sum to be sent to our address.
I should like to let you know, dear citizen, that it was a mistake on your part to have sent the money to Mr.
Ple-khanov.
We have already had the honour to inform you that since the Third Congress of our Party Iskra has ceased to be the organ of the Party and that Mr.
Plekhanov is no longer the representative of the Party in the International Bureau.
We have also had the honour to inform you that the Central Committee of our Party has not yet delegated a special representative to the International Bureau and that in all cases you should get in touch with Mr.
Ulyanov.
You advise us to come to an agreement with Mr.
Ple-khanov.
You should be aware that no agreement of any kind is possible between our Party and Mr.
Plekhanov until his relations with the Party have been officially settled.
I am therefore obliged to ask you to inform Mr.
Plekhanov that half of the sum should be forwarded to the Central Commit-tee of our Party (to Mr.
Ulyanov).

Dear Comrades, I have received a letter and a “statement” from Com-rade Konstantin Sergeyevich, and consider it my duty to give the following reply, which I would ask all members of the St.
Petersburg Committee to read.
Needless to say, the conflict should be examined, in accordance with the Rules of the Party, by the Central Committee, and I am far from presuming to pass judgement from here.
But in * A reference to Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution (see present edition, Vol.
9, pp.
15-140).
—Ed.
view of the reference to the “Lushin letter” as emanating from abroad, I must express my opinion.
Lushin is a despi-cable defector from the Majority to the Minority, offended for not having been invited to the Third Congress.
The “Lushin letter” was published by the author (in the press) earlier, before the Third Congress, and contained the ab-surd charge that the Majority had shown insufficient reso-lution (!) in fighting the Minority.
Comrade Konstantin Sergeyevich made a mistake in signing the letter, but to hold it against him would be the height of unreasonable-ness.
It was a forgivable mistake for a man unfamiliar with the “mores” (or rather lack of mores) of the émigrés.
Kon-stantin Sergeyevich himself dissociated himself at once from this Lushin person.
Having known Konstantin Sergeyevich first as a splendid, one of the most valuable correspond-ents, and then having met him personally in Geneva, I must commend him as a worker, and resolutely object to the “Lushin letter” being used against him.

05 Dear Friends, 1) I am sending you a draft contract with Malykh for ap-proval by the entire C.
C.
105 I advise approval, since there are a lot of people here who have nothing else to live on, and the Party cannot support them (including editors and contributors of Proletary).
This is a serious question, which I would beg you not to decide offhand; otherwise there is liable to be a desperate crisis.
2) I advise raising the 50 per cent to 100 per cent.
Malykh ought to agree.
3) Be sure to get an undertaking from her at once to submit to ideological guidance (and not only control) by a person to be agreed upon between herself and the C.
C.
This is quite possible, she will agree; this point is enormous-ly important in principle, and its practical significance for the future will also be very great.
4) You are placing me and especially yourselves in an impossible position vis-à-vis the International Bureau by not appointing a representative to the conference and not sending C.
C.
members here as promised.
106 For heaven’s sake can’t you see that in this way you are setting the entire international Social-Democracy against you.
I already have an inquiry from the International Bureau concerning the strange silence of the C.
C.
(I replied that you agree in principle to a conference without arbitration, that you will soon send delegates, and that talks are now going on in Russia between the Organising Commission and the C.
C.
).
It is necessary to give the International Bureau a pre-cise and clear official answer, otherwise you will seriously compromise yourselves, it will look as if you were evading the issue.
107 5) I have lost all hope of your coming.
Why didn’t you write a word about the end of Sysoika? Let me know whether you have definitely given up the idea of coming.
In general there has been no news from you about anyone for over a month.
6) As regards Plekhanov, I can pass on some local ru-mours for your information.
He is obviously angry with us for having exposed him in the eyes of the International Bureau.
He swears like a stevedore in No.
2 of Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata.
108 There is talk of his putting out his own paper, or returning to Iskra.
The conclusion: he should be regarded with growing distrust.
Best regards.

05 Dear Comrades, I have talked to Ivan Vasilich’s messenger and yesterday sent a telegram giving my consent.
I authorise Ivan Vasilich or Sergei Vasilich to make the necessary cuts in the Poor, 109 if it is taken away from Petrov.
I agree to its being taken from Petrov, but only on condition that this will not mean a break with Petrov, or a sheer deception of Petrov on my part, since I gave Petrov permission to try to arrange this thing.
This means it is necessary 1) at least to compensate Petrov for expenses already incurred (Ivan Vasilich’s mes-senger agreed to this); 2) to get Petrov’s consent to sub-mit to the decision of the higher body (i.
e.
, I permitted Petrov to make a try, while the C.
C.
decided to hand it over to Belov—so that Petrov should not have reason to consider me an unreliable business partner).
If Petrov has already succeeded in arranging things, I would stronglyadvise against taking it away from him, for I do not see how Belov is better than Petrov; 3) please get in touch with my sister * on this matter (she can easily be commu-nicated with), since she might have already made some arrangements in my name.
As for Petrov, I shall inform everybody here that 1) the C.
C.
did not endorse the contract; 2) we are within our rights in negotiating with Petrov on each separate instance since no monopoly has been established; 3) it is advisable to deal with the C.
C.
publishers as more advantageous and closer to the Party.
That seems to be all.
Write and let me know whether I have understood you correctly.
Your agreement with Nolin is good, but I am afraid it might be fictitious.
An “editorial committee”= 7—4—1= 2!! And these two are burdened with other things!! This is a fiction, not an editorial committee.
Besides, after signing an agreement with Nolin you all give heaps of work (Ra-din, Kamenev, Werner, Schmidt, Lyadov, Bazarov, Fedo-rovich, etc.
, etc.
—unless Belov has deceived me?) to Belov.
What does this mean? Nolin for the soul and Belov for the body, is that it? If our meeting does not take place, you will be kind enough to explain to me thoroughly by let-ter what is the matter.
It is altogether out of the question for people in the underground or members of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
to engage in the complex and bothersome business of publish-ing.
That is why Belov (and Petrov no less than Belov) is getting ahead of us.
And I seriously warn you that that is how it will be, for Belov has enterprising people who give themselves wholly to the business, while Nolin’s “edito-rial committee” (you can be sure) will not be able to de-vote even one-hundredth of its energies to this work.
We shall keep on talking, arguing, bargaining, holding meet-ings (we have been engaged in this laudable occupation ever since summer, for six months), while Belov and Petrov will do business.
I am not blaming anybody, for it would be absurd to do that—it is inevitable under the circum-stances.
This will change 1) if freedom is won—and then everything will change; or 2) if Pyatnitsky goes about it * Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova.

Dear Comrades, The International Socialist Bureau has forwarded me a letter from Vaillant setting forth the proposal of the Socialist Workers’ Party of France.
The Bureau has asked me to submit this proposal for discussion by the central body of my Party and to reply at the earliest date.
Vail-lant’s letter is as follows: “The question raised in my letter which you circulated was to in-troduce a definite proposal.
Today I am sending you this proposal.
I could not do so earlier, for to give it sufficient freight it was neces-sary that it should come from the party as a whole, from the Socialist Party (French section of the International Workers’ Party), which has adopted it unanimously through its delegates at an assembly of the National Council on Sunday, September 24 (September 11), in Paris.
The following is the proposal on which a decision is to be taken after discussion by the International Socialist Bureau: ‘As soon as developments, overt or covert, give cause to fear a conflict between governments and make war possible, the socialist parties of the countries concerned should at once, on invitation from the I.
S.
B.
contact each other direct with the object of determining and concentrating the actions of the combined forces of the workers and socialists to avert and prevent war.
“‘At the same time the parties of other countries would be invited by the I.
S.
B.
to a meeting to be held at the earliest possible date in order to determine what action on the part of the entire International and the organised workers is most suitable to avert and prevent war.
’ “Jaurès joins me in asking you to send at once a new circular letter to all parties.
You will understand, as will the socialists of all countries if they agree with us, how important, in view of the pos-sible developments, it is not to put off discussion of this question to a distant meeting of the Bureau, but to inform the Bureau directly of their agreement; thus, if the proposal is adopted, as we hope it will be, it could be implemented promptly in the event of a conflict.
”I for my part should like to add that, in my view, this proposal is somewhat naïve, since the only thing that can have an effect in the event of a conflict between govern-ments is the dictatorship of the proletariat.

L.
P.
At the comrades’ request I give here information concern-ing the Economic Commission in as precise a form as possible.
112 The Economic Commission consists of comrades special-ly appointed by the C.
C.
representative abroad.
At the present time (October 20, 1905) it includes Com-rades Bonch-Bruyevich (manager of the printing shop), Kruchinina (treasurer and manager of the forwarding of-fice), Ilyin, Lenina (secretary of the C.
C.
), Abramov, * Knol, Vetchinkin, Ladyzhnikov and Nik.
Vasilich.
Generally speaking, the function of the Economic Com-mission is to handle the business jobs of the Central Committee abroad, and to help the Central Committee in all its work abroad.
This applies to the technical end (printing, forwarding, and so forth), finances, transport, sending people to Russia, measures relating to arms, and so on, co-ordinating the work of all C.
C.
agents, control-ling the work of each individual agent, and so on, right up to special assignments from the Central Com-mittee.
The Economic Commission elects its chairman or secre-tary, etc.
, and distributes work among its members, with * See Avramov R.
P.
—Ed.
the exception of the appointment of permanent function-aries (in charge of forwarding, the treasury, the secretariat, printing shop, transport, and so on), which depends on the Central Committee.
Decisions of the Economic Commission may be revoked by the Central Committee or its representative abroad, but are not subject to endorsement by the C.
C.
unless this is asked for by some member of the Economic Commission or unless objections are raised by anyone.
For the purpose of control over the activities of individual agents of the C.
C.
(the treasurer, secretary, manager of printing shop, etc.
), the Economic Commission appoints comrades from among its members to make a thorough examination of the whole work of the given agent and to report to the Commission on measures to improve his work, and also to check up on the progress of his work from time to time.
The only exceptions are special activi-ties or spheres of activity exempted for one or another rea-son by the Central Committee from control by the Economic Commission.
The carrying out of all ordinary and current work undertaken by the C.

Dear Comrade, I am extremely worried about the fate of a certain packet of documents of historical significance.
117 It was among the papers left in your keeping about which the editor of an historical journal spoke to you this summer.
I would be very much obliged to you if you would drop me a line letting me know whether the packet can be located and sent here; where the suitcase or box is and whether the packet can be easily found there.

4 7 Printed from the originalQPW 133 TO ETIENNE AVENARD 118 March 1(14), 1907 Dear M.
Avenard, Thank you for your letter.
I would ask you to make the following corrections: (1) Page 6 (No.
1).
You quote me as saying: “not to work for the bourgeois revolution which would dupe the work-ing class”.
This is most inaccurate.
We Social-Democratic revolu-tionaries must not only work for the bourgeois revolution but we must lead it, direct it, together with the peasantry, against tsarism and against the liberals.
Perhaps it would be better to say: “.
.
.
in joint work, not with the liberal bourgeoisie, who want to put an end to the revolution, but with the democratic peasantry, against the baseness and treachery of the bourgeoisie, who are day by day becoming more and more counter-revolutionary”.
We Bolsheviks also stand for the participation of the proletariat in the bourgeois revolution.
But we believe, with Karl Kautsky, that it is precisely together with the peasants and by no means with the liberals that the proletariat can carry the bourgeois revolution to a victorious conclusion.
(2) Pages 3-4.
Stolypin’s article in Novoye Vremya 119 appeared on January 4 (old style) and not on January 6.
(3) It is necessary to add that Milyukov visited Stolypin on January 15.
(4) The last words of your article: “.
.
.
countless masses of peasant proletarians.
” Not “peasant proletarians” but “democratic peasants”.
In the social (socialist) revolution we can count only on the proletarians of the cities and the proletarians of the countryside.
At the present time, however, we have not a social revolution in Russia, but a bourgeois revolution.
And it is only the proletariat together with the peasants, together with the democratic peasantry, together with the broad masses of the peasantry, who can bring such a revolu-tion to victory.
Yours, N.

ALEXINSKY For Pyotr Dear P.
, I don’t know whether your letter was written before you met our local friend or after.
At any rate I am answer-ing your questions.
N.
K.
has spoken about the money question many times.
She will mention it again and so shall I.
I have not written to R.
because I myself recently saw (when I happened to be in those parts) two comrades from there and took up all matters concerning you with them.
120 You ask what I think about your work there.
It is rather difficult to answer this question in a few words.
When you have looked around you will see for yourself what material, information, etc.
, can be sent fromthere, but this is a relatively minor problem and can be easily solved.
The general conditions of work there is an-other matter.
I doubt whether you have ever seen such foul conditions as those in which the emigrants find them-selves abroad.
You must be extremely cautious there.
Not that I am advising against waging war with the oppor-tunists.
On the contrary, it is very necessary to fight there, and much fighting will have to be done.
But it is an ugly kind of war.
You must always be prepared for malicious underhand attacks, outright “provocations” on the part of the Mensheviks (they will systematically provoke you), and very little effective sympathy.
For over there you are fright-fully out of touch with Russia, and idleness and the state of mind that goes with it, a nervous, hysterical, hissing and spitting mentality, predominate.
The difficulties you will encounter there have nothing in common with the dif-ficulties encountered in Russia: though there is practical-ly full “freedom”, there is no live work or an environment for live work to speak of.
In my opinion the chief thing is for you to have work, your own work.
R.
may provide it.
.
.
.
More important still is it for you to maintain contact with the organisation in Russia: in that case you won’t feel rootless there.
And, finally, most important of all, we all, both there and here, should work in unison, march in step, exchange views more often (if not all views are clearly expressed in the press).
Only by working abroad in contact with the organisation in Russia can one protect oneself against being sucked down into the slough of despond, squabbles, the viciousness of overwrought nerves, etc.
My own memory of that “abroad” is only too fresh, and I speak from no little experience.
It would be very good if you would work together with Knunyants and Trotsky.
It would be much easier for you with them.
Anyway, you will see all this for yourself in time.
The address you have written to here should not be used on any account.
Besides, I shall be leaving here soon.
For the time being write me at this address: Herrn Kakko Paavo, Terijoki, and inside the envelope (and only inside) for L—n.
Let me have your address there as soon as possible.
Best regards.

It is devilishly sad to have to return to this accursed Geneva again, but there’s no other way out! After the disaster in Finland there was no alternative but to trans-fer Proletary 123 abroad.
That’s what the Editorial Board decided.
The only question is whether to Geneva or some other place.
So far we are making inquiries, but I person-ally believe that Geneva and London are the only places that are free.
But London is expensive.
I read your pamphlet about Stuttgart to the end; the third supplement came very late, I barely managed to read it before leaving.
I think you made a good job of it, and all the comrades were very pleased with the pamphlet.
* We all thought it unnecessary to “correct” it; it would have been a pity to mar your vivid and lively style.
And there is no syndicalism in it; what it does contain, in my opinion, is a number of major indiscretions “for use by” Plekhanov and Co.
Did you see his carping and base cavilling in Obrazovaniye or Sovremenny Mir? 124 We shall always have opponents of this kind and must be triply cautious.
Moreover, you also forgot about the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who have for quite some * See present edition, Vol.

time now been attacking the German Social-Democrats, making use of the criticism of the syndicalists and distort-ing this criticism into vituperation against Marxism.
I don’t know whether our people will now manage to put out your pamphlet.
Publishing has become difficult.
Did you get my first volume? How are you getting on? How’s the heir? I hear you had a good trip with Gorky.
Write and let us know what you are working on.
We count on you both as a contributor to Proletary and as a lecturer.
You will not let us down, will you? Where is Gorky? I wrote to him in Capri (Villa Blaesus).
I wonder whether it will reach him.

As representative of the Russian Social-Democratic La-bour Party in the International Socialist Bureau, I can inform you that the Estonian Social-Democrats (if I am not mistaken, they call themselves the Union of Estonian Social-Democrats) are part of our Party.
There is indeed in Revel a Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party consisting mostly of Estonians.
As regards citizens M.
Jurisson and J.
H.
Seppin, these names are un-known to me.
This in no way militates against them; the organisations of our Party function in secret and I know none of the Estonian comrades personally.
I shall write to the Central Committee of our Party in Russia and make inquiries about these citizens (and, to make sure, also to the Revel Committee), but we cannot expect a quick answer.

Berner Tagwacht No.
24 (Thursday, January 30) carries a statement by L.
Martov in regard to the case of Dr.
Semashko, a Russian comrade arrested in Geneva.
127 In this statement Martov for some strange reason refers to Semashko only as a journalist who had been present at the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart; at the same time he calls himself a “delegate of Russian Social-Democracy at the Stuttgart Congress”.
The Swiss workers will unquestionably interpret this statement of Martov’s to mean that Semashko has nothing to do with the Russian Social-Democratic Party.
In order that Martov’s utterly inaccurate mode of ex-pression should not mislead anyone, I, as representative of the Russian Social-Democratic Party in the Internation-al Socialist Bureau, hereby declare that Dr.
Semashko is an old member of our Party and that he was at the Interna-tional Congress both as a member of the Party and as a journalist working for the Party press.
I feel this explanation to be necessary inasmuch as our Swiss comrades are clearly evincing considerable interest in Semashko’s arrest.
All the Russian comrades who know him are firmly convinced that he is in no way implicated in the Tiflis “expropriation” nor could he have been.
And not only because the last (London) Congress of our Party categorically rejected this “method of struggle”, but also because Dr.
Semashko has lived uninterruptedly since Feb-ruary 1907 in Geneva, where he has engaged in literary activity.
We are firmly convinced that the international Social-Democratic press will very soon be able to welcome the release of the comrade arrested in Geneva with the same justified joy as Vorwärts (in Berlin) and l’Humanité (in Paris) at one time welcomed the release of the comrades unjustly arrested in Paris.

08 Dear Comrade, Yesterday Kon paid me a visit and showed me your telegram to him, and complained angrily, irritably about its impermissibly sharp, “police” tone, which he said he could least of all forgive you who are well versed in the nuances of the German language.
I believe I should give you an account of this characteristic talk with Kon.
I replied of course that I did not know what the neue Wend-ung * was, but that I was certain that you would not have sent such a telegram without good reason, and that to accuse Alexinsky, and the more so yourself, of wishing to entgegenarbeiten ** the investigation was more than lu-dicrous.
129 Kon told me—in confidence (not from you, of course)— that there is serious evidence against Litvinov, that he, Kon, knows Litvinov well and would not wish to make life hell for him or to take steps that would have very serious consequences for him; no, but that he, Kon, merely considers it absolutely necessary to show Europe (and especially the German Social-Democrats) that trial by the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is not a fiction and that the Party can vindicate itself.
“Surely a way can be found to do this without making life hell for anyone!” Kon exclaimed.
I, of course, said that in my opinion this could be done and that there was no need for him to worry.
There would be a hearing under all circumstances, the Party would see to that, so why worry? It would be a scandal, said Kon, if Alexinsky were to prevent a hearing.
Nonsense, I said.
Alexinsky does not want to prevent a hearing nor can he.
There already is a scandal, and it is the Mensheviks who are making it: see the article “Time To Stop” in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata No.
1-2, I said.
130 Kon hadn’t read it!! Think of it: while the investigation is still going on, while Litvinov’s lips are sealed, while the documents of the * New turn.
—Ed.
** To work against.
—Ed.
investigation cannot yet be published, the newspaper pours out abuse anonymously! Think of Litvinov’s position!! Yet this newspaper is actually the organ of the Central Bureau Abroad, 131 nourished by it.
And these are the judges??! That is how I explained Alexinsky’s behaviour to Kon.
To avoid any misunderstanding and false rumours I con-sider it necessary to pass this on to you.
For however sur-prised I was that Kon should have come to me, the fact remains that he did.
And I am afraid that as a representa-tive of the German party in the Central Bureau Abroad he might misquote me.
I do not think we can rely on this sort of a reporter to speak on Russian affairs before the Vorstand * of the German party.
It is essential that you personally as a member of the supreme collegium should speak with the Vorstand and without fail translate them the article in No.
1-2 of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata.
Other-wise such absurdities offensive to me as Kon’s coming to “complain” to me that Alexinsky is working against the hearing are bound to occur.
There is a limit to every-thing.

135 The secretary told me recently about the various plans concerning an article dealing with the history of factory industry.

Dear Comrade Huysmans, Comrade Isetsky (Salomon, Rue Goppart 78, Bruxelles) has probably informed you that three Russian comrades, members of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, Sarah Ravich, Khojamiryan and Bogdasaryan, arrested several months ago in Munich, 136 are being kept in con-ditions extremely.

that they have gone on hunger strike (Hungerstreike in German, [don’t know] what the equivalent is in French).
Their lawyer, the German Socialist Bernheim, writes us that it is absolutely essential to prove that the arrested people are members of the Social-Democratic Party.
I have sent him my official statement certifying that the arrested * Here and further several words are illegible.

08 Dear Comrade Huysmans, The official proceedings of the conference of the Inter-national Socialist Bureau held on October 11, 1908, will probably be published.
All the socialist papers which car-ried a report on this meeting of the Bureau (Le Peuple 139 in Brussels, Vorwärts in Berlin, Justice in London, l’Huma-nité in Paris, and so on) did not quite understand, and in some cases even completely distorted, the meaning of my amendment to the Kautsky resolution.
Although I submit-ted the text of my amendment to the Bureau, it does not figure anywhere.
I therefore fear that the same inaccuracies may be repeated in the official report.
Will you be so kind, dear comrade, as to see to it that the original text of my amendment is printed in the official proceedings.
This text ought to be among your papers, for I remember very well that I handed in to the Bureau the text I had written.
In the event that this text has been lost, I am enclosing an exact copy of my amendment and a translation of it into French (hoping that if the translation is poor you will be kind enough to correct it).
I shall be very much obliged, dear comrade, if you will drop me a couple of lines on this question.
140 Please accept my fraternal greetings.

Kautsky’s resolution (translation given in the Brussels Le Peuple, October 12, 1908): “In view of the previous decisions of international congresses to admit all organisations which stand for proletarian class struggle and recognise political struggle, “the International Bureau declares that the British Labour Party shall be admitted to international socialist congresses inasmuch as, while it does not directly recognise proletarian class struggle, it nevertheless wages it in practice, and, by virtue of its very organisation, which is independent of the bourgeois parties, stands for this struggle, and, consequently, shares the viewpoint of international socialism.
Lenin’s amendment: The last paragraph, beginning with the words “inasmuch as, while it does not directly recognise”, etc.
, should be worded as follows: “inasmuch as this party represents the first step on the part of truly proletarian organisations in Britain towards a conscious class policy and a socialist workers’ party”.

08 Dear Comrade, In reply to your query with Comrade Tyszka’s telegram enclosed I regret to inform you that I must refuse to pose the question as Comrade Tyszka would wish, for I believe that such a presentation of the question is absolutely in-correct.

141 Now Comrade Tyszka is appealing from Comrade Victor to me personally: “if Lenin himself objects to Igor,” the telegram says, “we shall give up Igor”!! This is tantamount to appealing to me personally against a decision of our group.
I shall not reply to this “if” of Comrade Tyszka’s.
In my opinion, Comrade Tyszka should himself withdraw his mo-tion to appoint Igor.

To the Moscow Committee In reference to the M.
C.
’s reply to the “Open Letter” on the “Party school” 143 signed NN, the Editorial Board of Proletary (enlarged) expresses its full solidarity with the view of the M.
C.
that a local organisation cannot and should not take the responsibility for any such undertaking.
Con-sidering the character of the future school and the range of its activities as planned by its sponsors, and its extreme remoteness from the areas of local activity, effective su-pervision over such a school could be exercised only by the Party centres.
Further, the editors of Proletary consider it necessary to amplify one of the statements contained in the “Open Letter ” you have received.
Among other things it says that the matter of “supplying the school with literary and practical workers” (teaching personnel) is “well in hand and proceeding successfully”; that “all the prominent Party theoreticians, mainly Bol-sheviks, will take part” in the school.
The addition that should be made to these statements is that both the Editorial Board of Proletary and the theo-reticians and practical workers of our group who are members of the narrow and enlarged Editorial Board and also of the C.
C.
of the Party, first learned of the said school from the Moscow Committee, while having had no intima-tion of it up till now from the organisers and the partici-pants in the school.
In the given instance, the Editorial Board cannot but regard the course of isolated action chosen by the organisers of this undertaking as inevitably stem-ming from deep ideological roots.
Here it will suffice to call attention to the open criticism by Proletary (see No.
42) of “god-building” and other distortions of Marxism associated with it.
In these organisational conditions and in view of the obvious exceptionally close connection of the future school with elements preaching “god-building” or supporting that preachment, the Editorial Board of Proletary considers itself in duty bound to declare that it cannot vouch for the character of the school being either Bolshevik or Marxist in general.
For all that the Editorial Board assumes that the legal right of the projected school to exist within the frame-work of the Party is at the present time indisputable.
The group should not involve itself in an enterprise the Bolshevik and Marxist character of which is not ensured; however, the Party as a whole in its present state, when in some of its very important institutions (e.
g.
, in the collegium of ad-visers to the Duma group) there are even extreme oppor-tunists of the type of Prokopovich or Kuskova, cannot deny it the right to exist.
The Editorial Board therefore consid-ers that the Bolsheviks in the C.
C.
, to which the initiators should apply for endorsement of the school project, should vote in favour of endorsement.

09 Dear Friend, Pokrovsky is staying with us.
A philistine of the first water.
“Of course otzovism is stupid, of course it’s syn-dicalism, but for moral considerations I and probably Stepanov too shall be for Maximov.
” All sorts of wicked people, don’t you see, are bullying the crystal-pure scoun-drels! These “moral” philistines begin to show how “moral” they are as soon as you start speaking in their presence about the historical task of uniting the Marxist elements in the group to save the group and the Social-Democratic Party! It was the opposition that invited this sorry moraliser— we didn’t invite him, knowing that the general meeting was being postponed.
* The news from Lindov and Orlovsky is so far not en-couraging: the former is supposed to be ill, the latter can come only to Petersburg.
But my letters addressed direct to them have not yet been answered.
We shall wait for their reply.
It looks as if Vlasov is now deciding the future: if he goes with the stupids, the philistines and Machists, then, evidently, there will be a split and a stubborn struggle.
If he goes with us, then perhaps it will be possible to con-fine things to the dropping out of a couple of philistines who are nil in the Party.
That blackguard Nikitich has gone to the S.
R.
s with a lot of gossip and made mischief! Just like those “moral” parasites: to go to another party to complain and lie about one’s own.
At the “trial” the S.
R.
s, obviously informed by Nikitich, are behaving insolently, they say.
144 We’ll hold this against Nikitich, we won’t forget it! I know nothing about the “Yuri-Nikitich” incident.
145 I thought you would be able to tell me about it.
In my opinion, you yourself right now ought to write to Yuri, * A reference to a meeting of the enlarged Editorial Board of Pro-letary.
—Ed.
respective * invite him to come to you, and obtain guarantees from him, or better still have the remainder transferred to a safe place.
Domov&Bogdanov&Marat are now pressing on the B.
C.
to set the date of the plenary meeting for the end of May or the beginning of June.
Actually it can only be held later.
Take your cure seriously, obey the doctors in everything, so as to be a little better by the time of the plenum at least.
Please give up the idea of running away from the sanato-rium: we are terribly short of people, and if you don’t recover your health (and have no illusions, that is not easy, it will require curing yourself seriously!), we may go under.
Try to start and keep up the most regular correspondence with Lyubich: this is imperative for we may have to call him out in an emergency.
Be sure to arrange direct corre-spondence with him.

C.
Members, Comrades Maximov, Marat and Domov .
.
.
with regard to your proposal to convene the B.
C.
now, we consider it necessary to state the following: 1) A number of previous meetings of the B.
C.
have shown that of the more or less important questions raised at these meetings there is a whole group that is obviously connected with the questions of a more general nature which the meet-ing of the enlarged B.
C.
is now being called to settle.
De-ciding this group of questions before the general issue of * Or.
—Ed.
the course the entire fundamental and practical policy of the B.
C.
as the leading organ of the Bolshevik group should take, is under these circumstances either impossible or in effect develops into a squabble and heightens its elements.
With the attitude to the decisions of the B.
C.
which we observe on the part of the “opposition”, comradely dis-cussion is reduced to a series of sallies by these comrades against individual members of the B.
C.
, to unwarranted repetition of gossip and slander.
2) In view of this, the B.
C.
, noting that some members of the B.
C.
have embarked on the path of division, has already resolved to allow decisions on urgent practical questions to be taken by means of a questionnaire circulated among B.
C.
members before the plenary meeting.
We there-fore see no need at present to convene a meeting of the members of the B.
C.
now in Paris, all the more as the question of the date of the enlarged meeting—the im-mediate purpose of the proposed meeting—can only be settled by obtaining the opinions of all members of the B.
C.
, mainly of those now in Russia.
Corresponding in-quiries have been sent to all of them and we are now await-ing the replies, of which you will be informed by the secretary.
The question of inviting representatives from the re-gions does not require special discussion, since their pres-ence is obligatory at enlarged meetings of the B.
C.
Comrade N.
’s statement concerning the date suitable for him would, of course, have been given the most careful consideration even if he had handed it in himself and not through three other members.

09 Dear Friend, I received your letter today.
On no account leave the sanatorium.
On no account move to a hotel.
You must im-prove your health radically before the plenary meeting, and this cannot be done except in the sanatorium.
We here have found the struggle against this stupid, petty, under-hand, disgusting squabble utterly nerve-racking; refused to go to the B.
C.
meeting (for things are becoming intoler-able), thus evoking triple hysterics on the part of Marat and Domov! No matter! But we need you in perfect health by the time the meeting is due, and so take your cure seriously and by no means leave the sanatorium.
I suppose everything is settled now with Y.
through the trip, though belated.
Things in Russia are bad: the whole Urals organisation has been arrested, the whole conference.
Shchur has evi-dently been taken as well: otherwise his silence is inexpli-cable.
Of Vlasov there is no sign.
Have you read Volsky? 146 Let me know your opinion, and if you don’t need the book, send it here.

09 Dear Friend, I received your letter and I protest vehemently.
Grant-ed we made a mistake with regard to Pokrovsky (I am pre-pared to admit it and to take the blame wholly upon my-self, for it was I who persuaded Grigory), but for you to leave because of that would be the height of absurdity.
The Pokrovsky affair cannot be helped now.
There’s no point in calling out Meshkovsky before Vlasov and the regional delegates (Shchur is safe and he vouches that from Moscow no otzovist will get in, Lyadov and Alexinsky.
.
.
* —he’s on Capri at the present time—won’t get in either.
From Petrograd, they say, there will be an anti-otzovist).
Now the thing to do is to wait for the B.
C.
plenary meeting.
Otherwise the squabble will grow—and after all we have stopped it.
There is no doubt that at a meeting with Po-krovsky present Bogdanov would have produced a dozen new grievances and involved Pokrovsky in them, now there has been only one.
And this was inevitable: don’t exagger-ate, please! The “resentment” of Nikitich and Lyadov and Pokrovsky, yesterday’s neutrals, is not accidental, it is inevitable; the thing has been festering, and now the boil is beginning to burst, and it is not always possible to keep one’s temper with this stinking squabble going on all around.
But for you to go would be madness.
We will endure it here for another month, without making matters worse, you may rest assured.
For you to wear out your nerves (and Paris is extremely nerve-racking) before the meeting would be the height of absurdity.
I protest a thousand times; you must stay in the sana-torium until the plenary meeting.
To economise 200-300 francs is foolish.
If you stay in the sanatorium we shall have at least one man at the plenary meeting with strong nerves, one man not involved in petty squabbles (here you will be dragged in, even if you were a Solomon).
If you leave, you will augment the number of those with frayed nerves, without benefit to the cause.
I protest most vigorously: on no account leave, be sure to stay in the sanatorium right until the plenary meeting.
No news from Vlasov yet.
Must be patient.
There was a letter from Lindov: he agrees in principle to come within one or two months.
That will be just right.
Orlovsky hasn’t * One word illegible.
—Ed.
replied.
In exactly a month from now we shall all be as-sembled and then we shall see.
In the meantime get well properly and you, at least, keep calm, for heaven ’ s sake.
Received a letter today, dated April 18, saying that my book is ready.
* At last! The delay irritated me more than anything else.
By April 25-26, old style, they promise to deliver it here.

09 [Dear Friend,] ** Marat arrived yesterday (wholly with the opposition), and also Vlasov (with us).
Vlasov promised to go to you in a few days.
So, stay where you are and on no account move, otherwise you may miss him.
Vlasov shares your sentiments: is with us in principle, but chides us for being hasty, for Pokrovsky’s victory, etc.
So you need not be afraid: from now on Vlasov will be in charge, and we shan’t commit a single misdemeanour.
Vlasov reproaches us with being unable to get along with people (here he is right).
So here too you have nothing to fear.
From now on Vlasov will smooth everything out nicely.
Meshkovsky and the regional delegates are coming.
So we shall get everything done.

your health seriously.
Under no circumstances must you leave the sanatorium.
If you are not completely recovered in three weeks’ time (or thereabouts, for one cannot tell exactly as yet) it will be a disaster for us.
Do not stint a few hundred francs—it’s absurd.
Attend to your health, do a lot of walking, sleep-ing, eating [this is obligatory], for the [Party] needs healthy property.
The Paris group met today.
The Geneva group announced its break with the B.
C.
and urged the Paris one to follow suit.
Marat spoke for Geneva, and Vlasov opposed him.
This is good: Geneva started the split and Marat incited the group against the B.

* The Swedish socialists have already found it necessary to take action on this score, and our comrade Branting, * See Lenin’s article “The Tsar Visits Europe and Members of the Black-Hundred Duma Visit England” (present edition, Vol.
15, pp.
461 -66).
—Ed.
on their behalf, has voiced in the Swedish parliament—in the form of an interpellation to the government—a strong protest permeated with the spirit of international socialist solidarity.
We are confident that our comrades in other countries share Branting’s view that the tsar’s visit cannot be re-garded as an ordinary official diplomatic act and will on their part protest as the circumstances demand.
It is important, however, to urge them to act without delay.
Clearly, the Russian section cannot do so directly.
We also believe that the Executive Committee and the Inter-Parliamentary Commission could take the initiative and issue an appeal to affiliated parties and also to their parliamentary groups pointing to the role played by Tsar Nicholas II in the outrages committed by the regime, of which he is not only a representative, but an active and criminal instigator.
The attention of our comrades in the other sections should be especially drawn to the brutality practised in the Russian political prisons, where tens of thousands of our comrades are paying for their striving for freedom and for having fought for the workers’ cause and socialism.
These facts were the subject of an interpellation made recently by the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, and we are sending you a translation of this interpellation 147 and would ask you to take note of it in drawing up your appeal and if necessary to forward it to the sections with the re-quest that they print it in the press.
With fraternal greetings, N.

A number of circumstances prevented me from writing to you earlier.
The translation of the Programme of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party which you sent me is, in my opinion, far from perfect.
However, my own knowledge of French is so inadequate that I cannot venture to under-take to correct the translation.
Comrade Charles Rappoport (of the journal Le Socialisme 148 ) has kindly agreed to do this work.
He will edit the translation and I hope to be able to send it to you soon.
As regards the meeting of the International Socialist Bureau, I vote for November.

The rela-tives of this comrade, who has been released from prison, have refused to support him, and he is unable to continue his studies at the University.

47 Printed from the original Translated from the French 172 TO CAMILLE HUYSMANS August 26, 1909 Dear Comrade Huysmans, Your letter of August 23 received, and I thank you very much for the copy of the letter from Gertsik, which you forwarded to me.
This gentleman has long pestered me with his letters; he has even wished to speak to me, but, needless to say, I have refused, for there is a ruling by a revolutionary tri-bunal consisting of representatives of all parties according to which Mr.
Gertsik cannot be a member of a revolutionary party.
This ruling has not been rescinded, and Mr.
Gertsik is definitely lying when he avoids mentioning the essential point of that ruling in his letter to you.
149 He wants the ruling revised? There he is perfectly within his rights.
But the gentleman cannot but know that there is a lawful and honest way of going about it, and if he avoids taking this way, if he prefers to turn to the I.
S.
B.
, this is further proof (it seems to me) of his dishonesty.
The lawful and honest way to ask for a re-examination would be to address the request to the central committeesof the parties whose representatives took part in the tri-bunal in Geneva.
Why doesn’t Mr.
Gertsik appeal to these committees? Why does he cite the private opinion of Mr.
Burtsev instead of applying to the Central Committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party of which Burtsev is a member? Why does he turn to the I.
S.
B.
with insinuations against the Bolsheviks, claiming that they are acting “dis-honestly”, instead of appealing to the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party? The Bol-sheviks belong to this Party.
They have only five members in the Central Committee, which consists of fifteen members.
You can judge for yourself who it is that is acting dis-honestly in this matter.
I never was a member of the Bolshevik group in Geneva which investigated the Gertsik affair.
If Mr.
Gertsik feels that the members of this investigating commission acted unlawfully, etc.
, it is his right (and his duty) to appeal to the Central Committee of the Party.
In my opinion, the International Socialist Bureau cannot accept complaints and requests that have not been first examined by the central committees of the parties affiliated with the International.
I fully realise that Mr.
Gertsik, like any other citizen, has the right to complain to the I.
S.
B.
against a decision of the central committees of the parties belonging to the International.
But if he does not wish to turn to the central committees of member parties of the International, he has no right, in my opinion, to appeal to the I.
S.
B.
either.
I believe that the only answer the I.
S.
B.
can give to Mr.
Gertsik is this: apply to the central committees of all the parties whose representatives took part in the tri-bunal, that is, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the Bund, and so on.
If these committees give no answer or turn down the re-quest, only then can you turn to the I.
S.
B.
with a request or complaint against one or another decision, against one or another central committee of a party affiliated with the International.
This is my opinion, of which, as a member of the I.
S.
B.
, as a Bolshevik, and as a member of the Cen-tral Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, I am informing you.
(There is a special bureau of the Central Committee of the Social-Democratic Labour Party in Paris, and Mr.
Gertsik knows very well that he should have applied to this bureau.
I myself am not a mem-ber of this body.
) I am very sorry, dear Huysmans, that I cannot be in Paris on August 30 and 31, 1909, and therefore will not be able to discuss this matter with you.
I hope you will forgive me for tormenting you with the bad French of this letter, which really has stretched out too long.
I am now holidaying out of town (Mr.
Wl.

I shall re-turn to Paris by September 15.

KAMENEV Dear L.
B.
, I received both letters and the article.
In my opinion the latter should be shortened.
I shall try to make the cuts, though I don’t know how successful they will be.
I shall wait for the article on international solidarity of the proletariat (I have a circular letter of the Inter-national Socialist Bureau on the subject; I am not send-ing it, for it is already late).
Let Grigory know about it.
What is this that the papers have been saying about Sokolov? It is of great interest to me, for I was going to write about the elections in St.
Petersburg.
I read in Rech 150 that the Social-Democrats are nominating Sokolov.
Write in detail what “fables” you have read about, and send the issues over.
I read the reviews in Vozrozhdeniye and Sovremenny Mir.
151 About returning to Paris Grigory writes that he will arrive by September 4.
I will not be back before September 15.
As regards your question whether you should go, I can only say this: if you have had a proper rest, it would be good to go, start a Proletary club at once, deliver two lectures (popular ones) to workers on Potresov’s liquidation-ism and another about the “Lefts” to Bolsheviks, and then arrange for a lecture tour to groups abroad in late September (roughly).
This you must do.
It will be interesting to discuss the Mensheviks and Prokopovich and Kuskova when we meet.
It is necessary to hit as hard as possible at Potresov’s liquidationism both in articles and lectures.
We are a bit late with this.
All the best.

Y.
ZINOVIEV Dear Gr.
, I am sending you Vorwärts 152 and Kamenev’s article.
I believe it must be printed and without delay, for we are terribly late as it is with this article which is in all respects absolutely necessary for Proletary.
It will have to be divided into two feuilletons.
The first (pp.
1-33) I have marked off and edited.
Perhaps you will be able to shorten it a little more? I will try to cut it some more in the proofs; send it immediately to the printers and have them sendme the proofs at once.
The article is an important one and we should go over it as carefully as possible.
It is a pity that Kamenev works carelessly.
The sub-ject is a most rewarding one, but he rambles on and on, beating about the bush, unable to get to the heart of the matter properly.
Perhaps we should send the second half back to him for rewriting from this angle? I think it would be a good thing.
Write him on behalf of us both and ask him to write the second part over again (saving the first variant as well ), to revise it along the lines indicated—tell him that this would make it an excellent article, etc.
—and send him the second part.
I have no great hopes that he will redo it, but we must keep insisting.
He also promised an editorial for Proletary shortly.
We shall see.
I shall write the articles for Proletary and send them straight to the printers * since you want to be in Paris on September 4.
I do not intend to return before September 15.
There is no point in your keeping Kamenev in Arcachon.
If he has had a rest, let him return, and under all circum-stances he must be sent out to lecture.
All the best, N.
Lenin I shall not undertake to write about the Bund people.
But it is necessary to hit at their No.

09 Dear Huysmans, I am very much surprised that Comrade Charles Rappoport, who promised me that he would translate the Programme and Rules of our Party, has not written to you.
He promised to do so several weeks ago.
I shall be in Paris in two or three days and shall ask him about it at once and let you know.
As regards the affair concerning Mr.
Gertsik, it is a very good thing that you have retracted the more than unfair accusation against our Party.
You ask for the address of the comrade “to whom Ger-tsik should apply”.
I repeat: he must apply to the commit-tees of the parties whose representatives participated in the hearing of the Gertsik case.
The address of the Bureau Abroad of the Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party is the following: Mr.
D.
Kotlya-renko (for the Bureau, etc.
), 110.
Rue d’Orleans 110.
Paris.

This address is regularly given in our papers.
I also wish to say again that I shall never reply to Gertsik since the scoundrel allows himself to level extremely insulting insinu-ations at the Russian Social-Democrats.
It is as simple as this.
If he has the temerity to say that the Russian Social-Democrats are “biased” judges, why does he not ap-ply to the committees of the other parties that passed judge-ment on him? Yours, N.

This nonsense must absolutely be deleted; it is stud-ents that should be invited to Paris to study, not a repre-sentative.
Some rabid otzovist, and even Lyadov or Ale-xinsky, might be elected representative, in which case we would find ourselves the dupes.
No, there can be no question of inviting a representative.
154 I still haven’t got Plekhanov’s Dnevnik.
I earnestly ask you to arrange for the forwarding office to send it to me at once.

09 My dear Huysmans, I received your letter of September 15, 1909, on my ar-rival in Paris.
I have seen the secretary of the Bureau of our Committee.
He informed me that he had recently re-ceived a letter from Gertsik and the Bund committee show-ing that Gertsik had at last applied to the committees of the other parties, which he should have done earlier.
The Bund is for reviewing the case.
The Bureau of the Central Committee of our Party will examine the request for a revision.
This, I hope, closes the “Gertsik incident”.
As regards Rappoport, he asks you to let him know the exact date when you absolutely must have the translation of the Programme and Rules.
Kindly write what the final date is either to me or to Rappoport, 39 Boulevard Port Royal, 39.

Comrade Rappoport says that his position as a literary proletarian compels him to ask to be paid for the transla-tion, at your discretion.
He definitely promised me thathe would have the translation ready by the date you set.
As for the historical survey, I have found a Russian com-rade who will do it in a few days.

TOMSKY Dear Comrade, Just got back to our capital here and read your letter on how things are coming along.
As regards the school, you are mistaken if you think “we are in a bad way”.
Nothing of the kind.
That workers, once they are given the money, should agree to go down to the glorious South is natural— there is nothing to complain about in this.
Only it is necessary to have resolutions adopted that on the way back these workers are to come here * for a month—this is the crux of the matter.
Unless they drop in here all talk about “supervision”, “direction”, etc.
, is sheer “blague” ** or hypocrisy.
To come here means to learn something more than Alexinsky’s whining and Lunacharsky’s “socialism”.
And believe me, this way *** —by bamboozling 20-50 work-ers with their learning—they will not get very far.
Oh no, it’s good enough for making a noise, for bragging about Ed.
* That is, to Paris, where the Bolshevik Centre was located.
— ** Humbug.
—Ed.
*** A reference to the factional, splitting activities of the organ-isers of the Capri school.
—Ed.
Kautsky’s letter, 156 for putting on a show abroad, but there is nothing serious about this underhand indoctrination.
Make no mistake, this is not a “school”, but a new Yerogin hostel 157 abroad for surreptitiously filling the heads of dozens of workers with otzovist nonsense.
Maximov and Co.
will merely make a noise for a while and end up with a fiasco.
The Trotsky business, regrettably, will not work out.
We offered him ideal conditions, sincerely wishing to enter into a bloc with him: a salary, payment of the Pravda deficit, equal rights on the Editorial Board, transfer here; he does not agree, but wants a majority on the Editorial Board (two Trotskyites and one Bolshevik!).
Clearly we cannot maintain in another city a Trotskyite, not a Party, paper.
What Trotsky wants is not to build the Party to-gether with the Bolsheviks, but to create his own faction.
Very well, let him try! By means of “his” faction he will win over some people from the Mensheviks, a few from us, and in the long run will inevitably lead the workers to Bolshevism.
As for the “slight revision of the agrarian question”, as you ironically put it, in the given case, if it is a matter of the role of the peasantry in the revolution, it is neces-sary to be more cautious.
The beginning should be made with a discussion in the general Party or general Bolshevik press.
I especially wish to warn against hasty rejection of Bolshevism and exaggerated faith in the success of the Stolypin agrarian policy.
It unquestionably posed new problems which must be studied and studied again; it opened the possibility of a non-revolutionary way out, but this is still as remote from complete success as the stars in the heavens.

C.
to reply to the “School Council” that the letter has been received and forwarded to the members of the Executive Commission and it will take some time before they can answer and take a decision, since they are all away.
The reply, however, should be rather caustic: to the effect that I am aware that Gr.
, Inok and Lenin have already replied on their own behalf to the Executive Commission of the school, but that the School Council will have to be answered by the entire collegium.
I have a request to make of you.
Send me a letter to the Editorial Board of Proletary signed Mark or any other pseudonym of yours.
Contents approximately as follows: “In view of Comrade Domov’s statement in the press ac-cusing the Editorial Board of Proletary of splitting activi-ties, of not putting out popular pamphlets, of betraying Bolshevism, of drawing closer to Plekhanov, of ‘Duma-ism’, and so on and so forth, I deem it advisable to acquaint Party comrades with Comrade Domov’s present views.
In the presence of Comrades Maximov and Lyadov and myself he said: ‘There are now two pernicious misconcep-tions: first—that we have a party, and second, that a revo-lution is imminent in Russia.
’ I made this public in a lecture to Paris Bolsheviks in the presence of Comrade Maximov, who could not deny the fact.
The comrades should know who it is that is now campaigning against Proletary.

1910 Dear Sir, I am very well aware of the scientific character of the dictionary and would gladly give you all the information you wish concerning the history of Social-Democracy in Russia.
But at the moment, unfortunately, I could not possibly write a brief essay on the history of Social-Democracy.
163 There is some good information up to 1904 in the report to the Amsterdam International Congress of 1904—Lidin, [M.
] Explanatory Material Bearing on the Crisis in Russian Social-Democracy (Geneva) [1904] and several articles by different authors in Neue Zeit.
In August 1910 an international congress will be held in Copenhagen.
Presumably the official report of our Party (Social-Democratic Labour Party of Russia) will appear within a few months.
There have been two major trends in the S.
D.
movement in 1903-09—“Mensheviks” and “Bolsheviks”.
In Neue Zeit you will find articles by representatives of both trends.
Bibliography: Cherevanin (Menshevik), reviews in Vor-wärts and Leipziger Volkszeitung.
164 Trotsky, middle po-sition (Vermittlerstellung) (Russland in Revolution, 1910).
I myself belong to the “Bolshevik” trend.
[There are] articles by Trotsky in German also in Kampf (Austrian S.
D.
review).

4 7 Printed from the original Translated from the German 189 MESSAGE OF GREETINGS TO AUGUST BEBEL To Comrade August Bebel On behalf of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, on behalf of all the workers of Russia who are waging a bitter struggle against oppression by tsarism and the bour-geoisie joined in counter-revolution, we send you, van-guard fighter of international and leader of German Social-Democracy, hearty greetings on the occasion of your 70th birthday.
You began your activity in the working-class movement almost half a century ago as a young turner, first a patriot, then a democrat who worked devotedly in workers’ educa-tional societies—and the path you have traversed reflects the stride forward which the entire international proletar-iat has made in that period.
At the beginning of that period most class-conscious workers either followed the bourgeois parties or at best sought their own class road to socialism by switching from one socialist or anarchist sect to another.
Now the vast majority of class-conscious workers in the civilised world are Social-Democrats, and it is precisely in Germany that the theoretical principles of Marxism have taken deepest root and spread most widely among the masses of the proletariat, illumining with radiant light their struggle for the complete overthrow of capitalism.
* The word “Lenin” was added later in pencil.
—Ed.
In your person we honour a working-class leader who has shown by his example that the emancipation of the workers must be accomplished by the workers themselves.
Drawing on the theory of Marxism, the German class-conscious workers, more than the workers of other countries, have been able to safeguard their movement against the mistakes of opportunism and anarchism, they have suc-ceeded in building up powerful mass trade union and polit-ical organisations and uniting in a single class force.
And at all crucial moments in history—when waves of national chauvinism rose high, or when rampant feudal-monarchist and clerical reaction declared a war of annihilation on socialist organisations—this class force was able to find the right road, to uphold its revolutionary world outlook, its confidence in the inevitability of the coming great so-cialist revolution, and carry it ever more broadly and deeply into the masses.
In the half-century of your activity the workers of Rus-sia see a guarantee that in the coming decisive battle, the dawn of which is clearly visible in Germany and other advanced countries, the Social-Democratic proletariat will not only fight with the same selfless energy and faith in its strength with which it won many a victory in the epoch of bourgeois revolutions, but will be able also to win and to smash for ever the entire edifice of capitalist exploita-tion.

10 Dear Comrade, I have read your letter.
I recall our joint work in Lon-don.
I recall that at that time (or a little later) I heard with one ear about the commission on your case.
166 That such an affair should drag out for nearly three years is in my opinion really outrageous, and I quite appreciate your indignation.
What is to be done? As far as I can judge, it is necessary to apply officially to the C.
C.
of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
and specifically to its organ abroad, the Bu-reau Abroad of the C.
C.
(address the same; inside—for the Bureau Abroad of the C.
C.
, R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
).
I think the best thing would be for me to forward your letter to them.
If you agree, I can do it.
If you would like first to try to push the matter through members of the Chief Executive, you had best apply to Yuzef (for you do not suspect him of any partiality).
And that should be done at once.
Send him a letter (by regis-tered post) addressed both to the Chief Executive and to the Polish Social-Democrat member of the Editorial Board of the Central Organ (also care of Kotlyarenko; inside: for member of the Editorial Board of the C.
O.
from the P.
S.
D.
).
If this is done quickly, I believe you ought to be able to get an answer and advice from Yuzef.
The permanent organ abroad of the C.
C.
, i.
e.
, the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad, can (and should) put an end to the affair.
The Russian C.
C.
would in my view be physically unable to do so.
How the Polish Chief Executive could have dragged it out so long and disobeyed its own Congress is more than I can understand! With S.

Dear Comrades, Our inquiry as to how you understand your competence in matters concerning conflicts in the Central Organ has * Manuscript partly damaged.
Words in square brackets have been inserted as suggested by the context and the remaining legible letters.
—Ed.
not yet been answered.
Nevertheless we consider it neces-sary to offer you some explanation with regard to a number of conflicts that have occurred in the new Editorial Board of the C.
O.
since the plenum—as we propose to do in the near future for the information of the whole Party and all Social-Democrats.
We shall begin with the last statement of Comrades Dan and Martov of March 29.
1.
It is not true that we decided to publish the article from Tiflis “containing violent attacks on the Caucasian Regional Committee”, for it had been decided to omit that section of the article and leave only the polemics on points of principle with the Georgian newspaper which the author, a local functionary, charges with liquidation-ism.
The authors of the statement, moreover, conceal from you the fact that the manuscript of this polemi-cal article was sent to the author of the Georgian article in order to give him an opportunity to reply in the same issue of the C.
O.
(Later on, at the last meeting of the Editorial Board, we decided to turn over the whole polemic together with the reply to Diskussionny Listok.
*) 2.
The authors of the statement conceal from you why we rejected Comrade Dan’s article on the tasks of the Party with regard to the persecution of the trade unions.
We re-jected it because the “tasks of the Party in this article are reduced to exchanging the struggle to overthrow the autocracy for the petty cash of Cadet ‘struggle for legal-ity’ ”.
3.
Comrades Dan and Martov consider it “unnatural” for us to have conferred separately on how to rebuff the base attacks on the C.
O.
and on the unity of the Party, while considering it “perfectly natural” that they them-selves, two editors of the C.
O.
, should have met with other editors of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata in order to launch a foul attack on the C.
O.
171 A conference of like-minded peo-ple within a collegium and joint discussion of an article * A reference to an article by J.
V.
Stalin, “Letter from the Cauca-sus”.
—Ed.
before laying it on the editorial desk for final judgement (moreover, in a case such as the given one), they consider to be a violation of the law.
But to be a member of the Editorial Board of the C.
O.
, entrusted by the C.
C.
, among other things, with the task of “explaining the danger of deviations ” towards liquidationism and otzovism, and at the same time a member of the Editorial Board of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, which shields, encourages and defends liquidationism and with regard to which the C.
C.
has spoken of the need to terminate its existence—this they do not consider incompatible with political integrity.
This habit of stabbing the Central Organ and Party unity in the back while at the same time demanding “collegiality” in drafting a reply to the back-stabbing they themselves have dealt, a habit characteristic of underground manipula-tors, we leave to the authors of the statement.
To discuss with them their own attacks against the Central Organ would have been an undignified farce on our part.
The only thing we could do was to lay the article on the editorial desk in order to give them a chance to acquaint themselves with its contents and to hear their objections.
That is what was done.
4.
The authors of the statement write that we “direct-ly deceived” them, for “no mention was made of any in-tention to publish—and with shocking distortion of the truth to boot—part of the correspondence between members of the C.
C.
and the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad”.
Not only did we not mention this to them, we made no mention of the contents of the article in general, for the simple reason that we gave the article to them.
Comrade Dan actually looked through the manuscript.
This is indeed deception on the part of Dan and Martov, who expected that you would not notice that a few lines earlier they write that we gave them the article to read in the manuscript, in other words, had no intention to conceal anything from them.
In order to show what our “shocking distortion of the truth” consists in, we are printing in No.
12 of the Central Organ all relevant excerpts from the C.
C.
letter.
The reader will be able to judge for himself.
5.
The authors of the statement write about the “secrecy aspect of the matter”.
But they forget to tell you that wedid not disclose in the press the place occupied in the Party organisation by the three liquidators, that Dan and Martov themselves published not only their names but also those of other liquidators in Nos.
19-20 of Golos Sotsial-Demokra-ta.
As for us, we can only reply to this in the words of Plekhanov that the only thing that “threatens” liquidators of the Party is “an order of merit round the neck”.
6.
The authors of the statement write that Bolsheviks too refuse to go into the C.
C.
* But they deliberately forget to tell you that it is not a matter of who wants or does not want to enter the C.
C.
but of who considers the C.
C.
and the Party unnecessary and harmful.
7.
The authors of the statement complain that their ar-ticles have been rejected.
But all these complaints have only one object: artificially to create the grounds for the existence of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata.
For this reason the authors of the statement are boycotting “Diskussionny Listok”, in which their articles could be freely printed.
They are deliberately wrecking this Party publication, too, whose purpose it is to obviate the need for factional organs, to enable all trends in the Party freely to express themselves whenever their views differ from those of the Central Organ.
For example, we suggested that Comrade Martov’s article “On the Right Path” be printed either in the Central Organ with an editorial comment (since the article challenges C.
C.
decisions) or in Diskussionny Listok.
The first of these alternatives was called giving the article a “gendarme” escort, and the second, “exiling” it.
And we were literally told: “now we shall open hostilities against you.
” * Here the authors of the statement indignantly say that the “read-ers of the article are likewise not told that the Polish Social-Democrats to this day have not been able to find anybody who would agree to repre-sent them in the C.
C.
” More, they have the temerity to underline these words.
This is just as foul a lie as the other allegations in the state-ment.
Just as the Polish Social-Democrats had their representative in the C.
C.
before the plenary meeting, so they have one now, after it, who is waiting for word when to attend the C.
C.
meeting.
Already a week ago the Polish C.
C.
member received a letter from his colleague in Moscow to the effect that he still has to wait, for the C.
C.
cannot be convened as yet.
8.
The authors of the statement complain that we print-ed an article about the conference which they allege “comp-pletely distorts the decisions of the plenary meeting on this question”.
What lies behind this complaint is this: the article in question wholly agrees with the C.
C.
letter on the conference, 172 and the anti-liquidationist letter of the C.
C.
about the conference is not to the taste of the ex-treme liquidator Dan.
The article was written by the com-rade who wrote the C.
C.
letter.
And Comrade Martov signed the C.
C.
letter.
It was adopted unanimously.
When he sent the proofs to the author of the letter, Comrade Martov wrote: “I have no objections to your text of the letter about the conference.
” But now, before the liquidationist cock has had time to crow thrice, L.
Martov hastens (together with Dan) to disavow the letter he himself accepted.
The statement of .
.
.
written by Dan and signed also by Martov naïvely reveals the real cause of the dissatisfaction of the Golos people with the C.
C.
letter on the conference and with our article on the same subject: the plenary meeting, it appears, allegedly decided to “reconcile” the Party with the “so-called liquidationism” and to “fill in the gulf” between the liquidators and the Party.
But the Central Organ is not carrying out this task.
We confess that we are doing the exact opposite.
What is surprising is only this: why did the authors of the statement complaining about the rejection of articles themselves reject in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata an article signed among others by Com-rade Martov, namely, the “Letter of the C.
C.
” concern-ing the conference? Why did they not reprint it either in full or at least in part? Probably because the C.
C.
letter “completely distorts the decisions” of the Central Com-mittee.
9.
The authors of the statement have the audacity to turn to you, the Central Committee Bureau Abroad, with a demand for “satisfaction” for the unpleasantness caused them by the exposure of the three practical liquidators.
They evidently believe that you might agree not to bring into the light of day the monstrous outrage against our Party committed by their associates Mikhail, Roman and Yuri.
They evidently ascribe to you the intention of con-cealing from the Party the conspiracy against the Partywhich we exposed and which a member of the C.
C.
in his letter from Russia asked you to make public.
We of course leave it to you to give all appropriate reply to such an insult to your Party conscience.
We on our part believe that no Party body will venture to side with the Romans, Yuris, Mikhails and their accomplices to any extent or in any way, not even indirectly.
Such individuals and bodies should be pilloried without delay and openly in the name of the entire Party.
We in the Central Organ of our Party, where we have been placed by the will of the plenum, shall unswervingly pur-sue this line.
The same fate will befall anyone who throws in his lot with those who would destroy the Party—who-ever he may be.
10.
The authors end their statement by threatening you that if you do not do as they wish they will set about ex-posing cases that were closed by the plenary meeting of the C.
C.
And this they promise to do despite the C.
C.
de-cision.
But this threat is no longer an instance of the usual fraktioneller Dreck, * as the representative of Latvian Social-Democracy put it at the plenary meeting of the C.
C.
referring to the way the Golos people had seized on these issues for the sake of factional muck; it is downright factional blackmail with regard to the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad.
And, of course, we leave it to you, comrades, to deal worthily with these blackmailers operating with factional muck.
But we refuse to go into all the falsifications, distor-tions of facts and downright lies amassed against US in the statements, complaints and protests of Martov and Dan.
You yourselves, comrades, will unquestionably be able to get to the bottom of all this factional muck, although we do not doubt that it will evoke in you the same natural feeling of revulsion it has aroused in us.
Nevertheless we would like in conclusion to draw your attention to two things.
First.
We should like to remind you that the present attempt of the Golos people to disrupt the C.
C.
is not the first.
As far back as the summer of 1908, when the Bolshevik members of the C.
C.
were arrested, the Golos people made * Factional muck.
—Ed.
a valiant attempt of this kind which was exposed at the plenary meeting of the C.
C.
(in August 1908).
At that time the Golos people proposed to the Bund comrades to join in a conspiracy to disrupt the C.
C.
But a member of the C.
C.
of the Bund (Comrade E.
) informed of this a Bol-shevik member of the C.
C.
(Comrade G.
) who had just been released from prison, and the conspiracy failed.
We still have on file the letter from the member of the Bund C.
C.
in which he writes that the Golos leaders deny the C.
C.
its very “Existenzrecht” (right to exist) and propose replacing it with some sort of information bureau.
173 The fact that the proposal to betray the Party was made by the Golos people in the C.
C.
to the Bund C.
C.
was confirmed also by other comrades from the Bund at the December (1908) conference (see the minutes of the conference).
Add to this the recent exposures by the Menshevik comrades Alexei Moskovsky and G.
V.
Plekhanov, and also the fact that Golos Sotsial-Demokrata has not once come out against the liquidators, but, on the contrary, constantly defends them, demanding that they now be recognised on a par with the Party, and even takes up the cudgels for Roman, Mikhail and Yuri, and you will have a pretty clear pic-ture of the prolonged, indefatigable, stubborn and most insidious attempts of all kinds by which the liquidators are seeking to achieve their purpose—to wreck the Party.
At the same time the danger of the liquidationist trend and the need to fight it most vigorously will become obvious even to the blind.
In view of this we believe that now is the time to publish also the letter of the Bund C.
C.
member Comrade E.
and in general all the facts relative to the attempts to liquidate the Party.
Second.
If the two Golos men—our colleagues on the Central Organ—write you that “a minimum of respect for the Party should have obliged” us “to relinquish our respon-sible Party positions”, we believe that common polit-ical decency and a minimum of self-respect should have induced them to abandon the false position they adopt in the Party and in the Central Organ by coming out si-multaneously in defence of the liquidators.
Incidentally, as distinct from them, we are not at all inclined to ascribeevil intentions to them as individuals.
The lies, the black-mail threats and all their other virtues spring not from their ill will, but from their false position which compels them to breed falsehood at every step.
Es ist der Fluch der bösen Tat, dass sie immer Böses muss gebähren.
* And the curse of their misdeed consists precisely in that they simultaneously occupy seats in the Party organ and in the organ which is out to liquidate the Party, with the result that they assume the contradictory mission of standing both for the Party and against it.
For this rea-son they do not even have the “courage” of the Romans, the Yuris and the Mikhails.
This position of theirs is com-patible neither with common political decency nor with a minimum of self-respect.
This is what creates that false position, that, so to speak, peculiar brand of Azefism 174 for liquidationist purposes, which impels them, with the best of intentions, toward the most unworthy actions.

10 Dear K.
, I received your letter (at last! I was about to kick up a row).
It is too late to send an express message or a wire.
We are in too “great haste”, you write.
I don’t know.
.
.

* How could Dan and Co.
have been allowed to get away with it? And what else .
.

wait for.
But it is a great pity you were not in “greater haste” to write us at once about the “formal doubts” entertained by the Pravda liquidators.
The proofs were sent to you ten days ago: if you had made haste to reply at once that you are not clear on this or that point, you would have had complete copies of the letters from Russia already a week ago.
Now the C.
O.
, which came out late last night, gives more quotations from the let-ters.
175 Is your withdrawal from Pravda essential for us? 1 7 6 You seem almost ready to say yes—again being “in haste” to write after the very first conflict with Trotsky.
I personally do not think that your withdrawal from Pravda is essential [to us], so long as Pravda [is] run so colourlessly.
After reading .
.
.
[your] item in No.
11, I thought ([and] Grigory also said): this is toothless, colour-less, [inconsequential], verbose.
.
.
.
What is the purpose of our policy now, at this precise moment? To build the Party core not on the cheap phrases of Trotsky and Co.
but on genuine ideological rapproche-ment between the Plekhanovites and the Bolsheviks.
Wheth-er this will work out I do not know.
If it doesn’t, then back to the Bolshevik Centre.
If it does, it will be a sub-stantial step forward.
We shall write to the Russian C.
C.

but it isn’t so much a matter of numbers as of the beginning of a break.
The first step is always the hardest.
In a few days the Mensheviks will publish Martynov’s reply to Plekhanov and, evidently, a reply to the C.
O.
Although Plekhanov does wish to keep open the possibility of “returning” to the Golos people, nothing so far seems to be coming of it.
Your withdrawal from Pravda—if it is inevitable—should in my view be arranged with the utmost care (write an article against the liquidators and against Golos, let Trots-ky turn it down!) with a view to reporting to the C.
O.
and drafting a decision on the publication of a popular newspaper by the Central Organ.
Either that, or back to.

delegates are hesitant about waging a resolute struggle for the Party and against the liquidators, embarking on the path of “conciliation” which objectively does a service only to the liquidators.
Hesitation at such a crucial moment in Party life is, we are deeply convinced, of advantage only to the enemies of the Party.
We shall be compelled to pursue a policy upholding the Party principle without your delegates, or, perhaps, even against them.
We hereby inform you of this in brief.
We shall give you a more detailed explanation within the next few days, in all probability, in the press.
We trust that you will understand why we are turning first of all to you, an organisation so close to us ideologi-cally and politically.

demanding his removal and resolutely combating the liquidators and upholding the alliance of the Bolsheviks and the pro-Party Menshe-viks, an alliance which alone could perhaps save the cause of unity)—this behaviour of yours convinces us that you, willingly or unwillingly, are a pawn in the hands of the liquidators.
We reserve the right to bring our statement to the at-tention of the Bolsheviks and, if need be, the entire Party and press.

I shall try to get other publications of this kind for you, although this is extremely difficult considering the position of our Party.
Regarding the proposals, resolutions and the report of our Party, I deeply regret to have to inform you that our Central Committee has not yet drafted the resolutions and that the report, unfortunately, is not yet ready.

KOBETSKY Dear Comrade, I am very grateful to you for the information and for your kind offer of assistance.
If it is not too much trouble, rent me a simple, inexpensive, small room from the 6th.
I shall be in Copenhagen by the morning of the 26th (for the Bureau meeting).
I shall try to drop in and see you the same morning (I don’t know when the train comes in, I shall probably go through Hamburg-Korsör).
If you go out, leave a letter for me with the landlady (für Herrn Ulianoff).
I shall take the room by the week or for a month, depending on what is more customary in Copenhagen.
I shall be in Copenhagen about ten days from August 26, then perhaps I shall go away for a week on personal business 183 and then return to Copenhagen again.
Thereforea cheap room for a month (if you, renting for a longer peri-od, pay 12 kr.
, I would probably have to pay about 15-18 kr.
for a similar room) would be more convenient.
If you have no time, do not bother, I shall be able to find something myself on August 26 or 27, since the Bureau meeting will only take up the morning.

4 Printed from the original204 TO THE EXECUTIVE OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF GERMANY Copenhagen, September * 2, 1910 Dear Comrades, The August 28 issue of Vorwärts carried an utterly outrageous anonymous article about the state of affairs in the Russian Party.
185 At the height of the work of the International Congress, when everyone is moved by the desire to preserve socialist unity, to discuss with the ut-most caution the internal disputes in the parties of the dif-ferent countries, to avoid if possible interfering in these disputes, to demonstrate the strength, the grandeur and moral prestige of Social-Democracy in all countries—at this very time the Central Organ of the German Party suddenly, without any reason, without the slightest ap-parent need, prints an article containing incredible at-tacks on Russian Social-Democracy.
The above-mentioned article shamelessly criticises the entire Social-Democratic movement in Russia; it strives to represent Russian Social-Democracy to the foreign public in the darkest colours, as being in a state of decline, impotence and degenera-tion.
Further, it assails and slanders all the existing groups and trends in the Party without exception, from top to bottom; and, finally, it contains crude attacks on official central bodies of the Party—the Central Commit-tee and the Central Organ—accusing them of factional prejudice, etc.
; individual members of these central bodies too are slandered in the most outrageous manner.
Such an article in the Central Organ of the German Party, the anonymous author of which was prompted solely by a desire for revenge for some petty personal grievance, will damage the interests of the Social-Democratic move-ment in Russia; it constitutes an unexampled violation of international solidarity and brotherhood in relation to Russian Social-Democracy.
And if the Russian Party, which has many well-known writers, has for several years * In the original “August”, obviously a slip of the pen.
—Ed.
avoided parading its internal affairs on the pages of the German Party press, that is only because it does not consider the foreign press to be a suitable battlefield for settling its disputes.
The building of the unity of the Social-Democratic Party of Russia is and remains the paramount and most difficult task for all the comrades in Russia, and primarily for the central bodies of the Party.
Clearly, it is essential, in the interests of preserving unity, to avoid anything that is prejudicial to the resolving of internal differences.
No one of course should object to the problems of Russian Party life being treated in a calm, objec-tive manner.
But we are most emphatically opposed to male-volent, petty and treacherous attacks on the movement, the Party and its central bodies, such as that contained in the above-mentioned article, the more so since the anonymous author who poses as an omniscient outsider is introduced as a correspondent of the Central Organ, the newspaper Vorwärts, which lends the article an official editorial character.

* I could then leave on Tuesday, for it is time for me to be in Paris, and I must now make haste.
Regarding the room, please find out whether I could spend the night there on the 26th.
If not, I shall return the keys when and where you say (I have taken them with me).
By the way, I left a book on the table (reports and the main report for the Copen-hagen Congress in French, in a folder).
If the former lodger occupies the room on the morning of the 26th of Sep-tember I would kindly ask you to go there and pick up the book so that I could get it from you.

EDITORIAL BOARD 186 Dear Comrade, Having walked out of today’s meeting I consider it my duty to explain to you, in case of any Party (and quasi-Party) rumours and gossip, the significance of my action.
I consider it not only my right but my duty to refuse to participate in a so-called “discussion” which serves as a pretext for the liquidationist section of the Editorial Board to indulge in the worst kind of rumours circulated by the worst kind of anti-Party elements.
When Martov, for ex-ample, refers to the otzovists as a section of the Party, and at the same time openly repeats the gossip noised by the most blackguard elements of the otzovists abroad, alleg-ing that the case of Comrade Victor was closed or hushed up as a result of bribery, 187 and at the same time demands that they, Martov and Dan, be protected from such sus-picions on the part of “a section of the Party”, then anyone can see quite clearly that under cover of “protection” from otzovist blackmail we are being offered nothing more nor less than liquidationist abetting of otzovist sallies of the worst kind.
Considering it beneath my dignity to participate in a “discussion” in which such things are brought up, I declarethat in future too I shall try to walk out of any meeting where there is such a “discussion”.
With comradely greetings, N.

BONCH-BRUYEVICH Dear V.
D.
, I received today more news about the new literary child 188 but, surprisingly, not a word from you.
What does this mean? I am extremely worried about the fate of the child.
They write, for instance, that they fear the material sent is out of date.
This worries me greatly.
I insist most categorically that everything sent in should be published (with corrections owing to “unforeseen circum-stances” if need be).
This is after all a matter of principle, a matter of policy.
We have no information as yet on this question, we are depending on you, and you are silent.
This is impossible.
A few lines from you once or twice a week is the minimum necessary to maintain contact and to feel closer to things.
To make matters worse, there are letters from the “discontented” (I received a long letter today from one of them—I daresay you can guess from whom).
And so I beg you: write, write more often and in greater detail.

Dissention over what, I cannot understand.
What the trouble is I do not know.
189 You really must not leave us here without information—afterwards we are blamed for holding up things.
Why shouldn’t like-minded people be able to work together on a newspaper, once there is agree-ment on the main thing, namely, not to allow the Potresovs and similar riffraff from Nasha Zarya to come anywhere near it? 190 And such agreement does exist.
We shall notify them today of our opinion that a third be included (there was a clear understanding, after all, that the third place belonged to us).
191 I am informing you in order that there should be no misunderstanding.
The third has one-third of the decisive say—is that so much? Are you against that? I hope not.
I would be very glad if this business could be settled without friction.
It is time, high time, to get started on the paper and the journal too.
As regards the journal, we are not asking for much: find us an executive secretary and a couple of applicants for permission to publish.
192 Surely that is not so difficult to arrange? Well, I shall wait for word from you.
I hope that the matter of the discontented will now be settled.

11 Dear Comrade, You have probably not forgotten that you promised an article for our journal Mysl.
The first issue of Mysl has already come out (in Moscow) and it has not been confis-cated.
It contains, among other things, articles by Ple-khanov on Tolstoy and on Italian opportunism (compared with our liquidators), my article on statistics on strikes during the Russian revolution, * Rozhkov’s article on the new agrarian policy of the Russian counter-revolutionaries, etc.
Issue No.
2 will be out shortly.
We would be extreme-ly grateful to you if you could write something for us— about neutrality, for instance, and against trade union neutrality.
This question has again been coming up for discussion here now and perhaps you will like to dwell in somewhat greater detail on what you wrote about Legien in Neue Zeit.
Needless to say, we shall be happy to receive any article from you on any subject.
195 I am sending you by book-post my article against Martov and Trotsky, not for publication, but to ask your advice.
Karski has already replied to Martov.
You wanted to leave it to me to write the article against Trotsky.
But you will see from my article that it is very difficult for me to criticise Trotsky without touching Martov.
Perhaps you could advise me how to make the article suitable for Neue Zeit.
** * See “Strike Statistics in Russia” (present edition, Vol.
16, pp.
393-421).
—Ed.
** See “The Historical Meaning of the Inner-Party Struggle in Russia” (present edition, Vol.

—Ed.
I should like to offer the editors of Neue Zeit two more articles: 1) on Russian strike statistics for 1905-07.
This is probably the first time we have statistics on mass strikes (economic and political separately) for the entire period of the revolution.
The opportunists (= Menshevik liquidators) are constantly accusing us Russian Bolsheviks of “romanticism” and “Blanquism”.
The best answer to this perhaps is dry statistics which might be not without interest for the German comrades as well.
If you agree in principle, I shall send you either a detailed excerpt from my article or else the complete translation.
I am only afraid that my article will be too long for Neue Zeit.
2) I have prepared for a Russian journal a summary of German agricultural production statistics for 1907 (the three volumes already out).
* I don’t know yet whether it will be printed in Russia or not.
As can be seen from the German Social-Democratic press, this subject has already been discussed, but regrettably (for instance in Vorwärts) solely on the basis of a bourgeois treatment of the mate-rial.
I have come to the conclusion that the 1907 census bears out the Marxist theory and refutes the bourgeois (including David’s theory).
The data on female and child labour (employed more by peasants owning 5-10 hec-tares of land than by the capitalists or by proletarian farms), for instance, seem particularly interesting to me.
Here the number of working members of the family and of hired workers is given for the first time.
It turns out that in the group of owners with 10-20 hectares of land the num-ber of hired workers amounts on the average to 1.
7 per farm, and the number of working members of the family, to 3.
4.
These are already big peasants who cannot do without wage labour.
Extremely instructive, too, is the classification of farms according to total number of workers (I break them up * See the article “The Capitalist System of Modern Agriculture” and preparatory notes for it, “German Agrarian Statistics (1907)” and “Plan for Processing the Data of the German Agricultural Census of June 12, 1907” (present edition, Vol.

into three main groups: 1-3, 4-5, 6 and more workers, in-cluding hired labour).
Do you think such a treatment would be of interest to German readers? If so, I would gladly write on this subject for Neue Zeit—only the work I have prepared is far too voluminous! If the “peasant farms” (5-10, 10-20 hectares) specially prospered in the period 1895-1907, this, in my opinion, is no evidence of the success of “small-scale production”.
It merely testifies to the success of intensive capitalist farming and livestock raising in particular.
The reduction in the area of the farms signifies expansion of capitalist and big-peasant livestock farming.
I trust that you are now quite well and that you will answer Quessel and Maslov yourself.

RYKOV For Comrade Vlasov (and also, if he wishes, for the Poles) Dear Friends, After giving thought to the whole agreement (resp.
the formulation of a common base and line of action for all of us) arrived at in the Bureau between the P.
S.
D.
* and both Bolshevik trends, I cannot but point to the weakness, the shortcomings of that base.
196 The essence of the agreement is (a) to lay down a preci-se, clear-cut anti-Golos and anti-Vperyod line of principle, i.
e.
, to reiterate and reaffirm struggle against both liqui-dationism and otzovism in absolutely concrete terms rul-ing out any misrepresentations and evasions (from which the Party has suffered so much); (b) a practical “reform”, i.
e.
, such a change in the com-position of all centres (or rather in the “factions” or “trends” represented in them) as would guarantee the pursuance of this line of principle.
How does this work out? Both the theoretical “line” and the practical activities are determined by the Central Committee.
And its composition? In the event of a simple “ultimatum” (and a cheap, very cheap one to boot) from notorious dodgers, prevaricators, scoundrels and unprincipled bargainers (like the Bund), etc.
, you are “prepared” to set the number of members at 8.
And this 8 is equivalent (as is now obvious) to two groups of four.
The result: neutralisation, i.
e.
, the complete impotence of the C.
C.
!! This is exactly what the liquidators want.
No reforms in our sense (i.
e.
, as we have all agreed) could be carried out with such a composition.
It is an absurd situation: we agree to give the Party * Polish Social-Democracy.
—Ed.
the money, Rabochaya Gazeta 197 and all our energies con-ditionally.
On what conditions? The line of principle and the reform.
Who carries out the one and the other? The C.
C.
And what is the guarantee that they will be carried out by the C.
C.
? A chance ultimatum presented by the ene-mies of Social-Democracy (such as the liquidators from the Bundist intelligentsia)!! An agreement to do what the C.
C.
cannot possibly do with eight members.
That is the result.
That result is a repetition of the mistake made by the plenary meeting 198 : good wishes, nice words, excellent ideas—but no power to carry them into effect.
Castigation of the liquidators in words and captivity to the liquidators in reality.
It is for you practical workers to carry out the “agree-ment”—you are the ones who introduced the clause con-cerning the eight.
It is my duty, after studying the agreement carefully, to warn you: the liquidators will again make fools of you! It is easy to “call oneself” a Plekhanovite (Adrianov and his ilk would doubtless call themselves the devil and satan if only to get some small concession: a title is a word, but a concession is reality).
In reality you will be getting with your eight an impotent institution shackled by the liquidators.
That is the danger of which I consider it my duty specially to warn you.
If you, as practical workers, undertake to establish a C.
C.
(or rather, an eight) capable both of condemning the Golos and Vperyod people, and of carrying out the reform— that is up to you.
Heartily desiring peace and accord with you, I am pledged to help you to carry out your plan.
But to help does not mean lulling you with “the enchant-ment of fine words”.
To help means to point to the real dangers which one must be able to avoid.
The plenary meeting of January 1910 held up the prac-tical work of the centres for a year by tying their hands, letting them be shackled by the liquidators.
In the spring of 1910 Inok did not succeed in escaping from that bondage.
In the beginning of 1911 you will not be able to either, unless you take urgent measures to carry out the agreement.
Best wishes, N.

RYKOV Dear Al.
, We are sending you some novelties: 1) Igor’s statement (copy) submitted by him today to the Central Committee Bureau Abroad.
* 199 2) The resolution of the San Remo “group” (read Plekha-nov “and his household”).
Today Lieber told the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad that Adria-nov is near Moscow and that according to his, Lieber’s, information the question of whether to call the C.
C.
in Russia or abroad is being discussed.
In our opinion Mikhail Mironych must be sent to the Samovars ** (we are trying to send him to you tomorrow, i.
e.
, to get him to leave tomorrow.
I spoke to him today and he agreed).
He has a reason for finding it inconvenient to go to Russia just now, but the reason is unimportant and he has agreed to go to Russia also.
Here is what you should do: send him at once with two assignments: (1) to send Lyubich abroad immediately; (2) to see the Samovars and persuade them to decide for abroad and leave.
It is unreasonable, absurd, mad to risk failure when in the enclosed official paper Igor expresses himself in favour of abroad and even promises to get not only Adrianov abroad, but also the “London candidates” 200 (i.

POLETAYEV Dear Colleague, I received your letter of February 10 about the betray-al of the person you call—Y.
—.
You ask me to “announce this” to the 58 Mensheviks.
201 You must forgive me but I cannot comply with the request.
I do not intend to announce anything or to have anything to do with such individuals.
If you do not understand why, I shall tell you once again.
You close your letter with the words: “Don’t you people in Paris realise how your squabbles affect us? ” The liquidators in Paris understand full well what they are doing.
It is a pity that among you in St.
Petersburg there are people who do not understand what they are do-ing and what they read.
A great pity! Such people are fated always to be led by the nose.
The liquidators here, i.
e.
, the Golos people, put out leaflets, such as the leaflet of the 58, specially to provoke squabbles and confuse the struggle over issues of principle.
We have declared (in every issue of the Central Organ and every issue of other publications * known to you and closer to you spatially) that we shall not tolerate the group of Mr.
Potresov * The newspaper Zvezda and the journal Mysl.
—Ed.
and Co.
, the ideas of Nasha Zarya, etc.
, that we cannot tolerate them, but are fighting them and shall continue to fight them unrelentingly.
This is a company of liquidators, enemies of Social-Democracy, and their ideas are the ideas of traitors.
The Golos people are unable to wage a principled strug-gle against this and hence the Martovs, Dans, Axel-rods and Martynovs reply with scandals and blackmail.
Is the leaflet of the 58 not an instance of blackmail? The leaflet of the 58 contains false accusations (insinuations).
.
.
, * for instance, although the Bolsheviks absolutely loyally liquidated after the January 1910 plenary meeting .
.
.
every-thing connected with them.
Why make these accusations in the form of dark hints? The answer is: a leaflet, also printed, also put out in Paris, also originating in the Go-los camp, only signed not by the 58 but by the “Editorial Board of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata”.
What is the content of this leaflet? It amounts to this: equality in the Edito-rial Board of the C.
O.
and there will be peace.
202 One comrade writes: is this not despicable? To level criminal charges today and to write tomorrow: “Let in one more man into the Editorial Board and there will be peace.
” Why, that is blackmail! Can people with any political experience fail to see do-zens of such examples everywhere (especially in the Third Duma)? Has not the history of Menshevism given a mass of examples of such blackmail? How often “crimes” have been charged and then forgotten after equality or the majority has been gained.
As for me, I called the blackmailers blackmailers in print in May 1910 and in Diskussionny Listok.
** If there were some who did not heed the warning, so much the worse for them.
—Y.
— called the paper “foul”.
—Y.
— was right.
I do not know—Y.

—Ed.
the blackmailers they will continue to frustrate your efforts with scandals, to spit in your face.
If you do not like it, learn to fight and not complain.
Needless to say, we answered the blackmailers properly and will not agree to any equality with them.
We com-pletely exposed the Potresov gang for the liquidators they are.
More, this gang is now flirting with the group that vio-lated after the January 1910 plenary meeting the resolu-tion on.
.
.
.
* The Golos people are covering up .
.
.
who are “against” Lenin-Plekhanov.
This too we will expose, I can assure you.
You cannot sit between two stools—either you are with the liquidators or against them.
I reserve the right to pub-lish this letter.
How are things in the Editorial Board? ** You must see to it that we should be represented, by your-self, if there is no one else.
At any rate you are obliged to find us a representative.
Why don’t you return rejected articles? Rappoport has sent two articles but has received no reply.
A young man, short, thick-set (Jewish), with a recom-mendation from me, will shortly come to see you.
Help him in any way you can.
As for the paper, in my opinion, you should join it yourself for the time being, so that our trend should not be left without a representative, for that would be disgraceful.
For we hope they will not give up under the first pressure but will try to carry on despite the closures.
All the more necessary, then, is it for you to be there.
Send us at once the text of the platform worked out by the group for the Moscow elections.
203 Will you come here to see us at Easter? There is much to talk about.

RYKOV 10/III.
11 Dear Vlasov, We are sending you (and Grigory) a copy of a letter written today by Semashko (a member of the Central Com-mittee Bureau Abroad) to Grigory.
From this letter you will see of course that the crisis is coming to a head.
The Bundists have shown their hand 204 (whether it was Makar who made them do so or the arrests in Petersburg 205 that are to blame, God only knows).
It is perfectly clear that the Bundists have understood full well the simple truth that now everything depends on the votes: whether the Poles&the Bundists will have one vote more or not.
The Bundists are fighting desperately to have that extra vote in the Central Committee.
So much is clear.
The Bundists are stopping at nothing to gain that extra vote in the Central Committee by hook or by crook.
Of the Golos Mensheviks there already are two that are certain, the Londoners Kostrov and Pyotr, who was recent-ly released (we have been informed to that effect).
The enemies, then, have fully united.
The only way to save the day is to get Makar, Lindov, Lyubich (and if possible Vadim) out of the country at all costs, and without delay.
Somebody must be sent over for this purpose.
For God’s sake can’t you see that by delaying the dispatch of a person you are risking every day the arrest of Makar, the failure of everything.
Send Mikhail Mironych (and if he refuses, Chasovnikov from Liége, or Pyatnitsa’s wife, she has the proper papers and already went once) to both Lyubich and Makar at once, without fail.
If you don’t do this, you are risking throwing away the last chance of convening a plenary meeting and restor-ing the C.
C.
in general.
If Yudin is at loggerheads with Makar, it is possible that Makar too has seen through the manoeuvres and trickeryof the Bundists; but to see is not enough, one must know how to fight.
If Lindov cannot travel abroad, let Makar come alone (after obtaining authorisation to act for the Bureau); with Makar here we shall find a way out of the situation to-gether with him.
Reply at once.
Yours, Lenin Sent from Paris to Berlin First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin Miscellany XVIII Printed from the original 221 TO A.

RYKOV Dear Vlasov, It is a strange thing you are suggesting! Such a telegram must not be sent, we cannot take the risk.
If you want to chance it, you could send it from Leipzig, but we do not advise you to do so.
Can money really be the hitch? Could they not have borrowed enough for a ticket to Berlin?? The delay is obviously not because of money.
The Bundist scoundrel and liquidator (Lieber) goes around saying here that he knows of some sort of hitch and some sort of trip to the Caucasus(!!?).
206 Some more news: Kostrov and Pyotr have been released.
Both call themselves Plekhanovites.
But we know for certain from the plenary meeting that both are liquidators.
You made a colossal mistake by not getting a proxy from the Samovars and now are making things worse by not sending anybody to them.
Don’t you see what’s happen-ing? Time is running out (the Pravda crowd are already electing delegates in Moscow for the conference 207 —a split is imminent).
You’re losing your patience.
A sheer comedy.
Clearly, what we insisted on should have been done: somebody should have been sent at once to the Samovars.
Do so without delay, otherwise an absurd situation will develop.
After all that has happened and after what you have said we too cannot trust the Samovars and wait, wait for months and months.
We will be compelled by such pro-crastination to break off everything, to tell the Germans that there is no C.
C.
and demand the money back at once.
There is nothing else left to do, and your passivity (“may-be the Samovar will budge”) is to blame for everything.

I.
RYKOV Received your letter with the news about the call sent to M.
M.
You are doing right in sending it.
So far the non-conciliators have sent 4 (if not 6).
This makes a big difference.
That’s one thing.
Secondly, it is time to is-sue an ultimatum; you yourself are aware of this when you say: “one must lose all respect for the Party to drag things out endlessly.
” True! Right! Correct! Only there must be no threat to withdraw from the C.
C.
, as you propose.
That would be a mistake.
Don’t do that.
* Threaten to protest publicly against the Bureau and to show them up for a nil or even worse if they, after having placed their confidence in you and offered you their authorisation, do not go abroad at once.
* If you withdraw from the C.
C.
, it will he tantamount to desert-ing the field of battle, betrayal of Bolshevism at a difficult moment.
You must not withdraw but send an ultimatum to Makar and, if he does not show up and yield, fight as a member of the C.
C.
to get the money returned.
You should invite Lyubich.
It will be a mistake not to.
It is ridiculous to grudge 200-300 extra rubles when it is a matter of the finale of the entire C.
C.
Lyubich is needed precisely so as not to be dependent on a “philistine and coward”.
2 0 8 Only from your letter did I see how base this “philistine and coward” is.
People like that should be pinned to the wall, and if they don’t submit, trampled in the mud.
I shall do that publicly by printing the record of our relations with the Bureau when my patience has been exhausted.
There is full clarity now.
Line-up against line-up.
It’s either 2 &1 for us and the P.
S.
D.
* 2 0 9 or a Menshevik vic-tory in the C.
C.
, our withdrawal and a disgraceful split.
But even if only Makar and Lyubich are brought over the situation could be saved: Plekhanov and the group will be for us, and we can nip the Menshevik split in the bud.
The scoundrels would not dare in that case.
I am enclosing a copy of a letter I received from a work-er in Bologna.
He understood the Vperyod “platform”!! But look at those Golos scoundrels: Golos agent Volontyor, a member of the Party School Commission, goes against its decision and carries on agitation against it among the ex-ists!! 210 Now I’ll expose them in the press.
Semashko was sent from the School Commission to Bo-logna.
The blackguards have been caught red-handed, they won’t wriggle out of it! Return the copy of the letter.
I am enclosing a letter from Finikov (return immediate-ly after reading).
Tell me, am I not right in saying that a Bolshevik like this is stronger than a hundred “concilia-tors”, for he has understood the situation whereas the lat-ter do not want to understand it? With a few such we shall defeat hundreds of “conciliators”.

224 TO THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC GROUP IN THE THIRD DUMA Comrade Poletayev has forwarded to us through Lenin the plan for the publication of the report of the Social-Democratic group which the group discussed before Pole-tayev’s departure for Berlin.
We on our part are fully in favour of the group’s plan and suggest agreement on the following final terms.
We shall set up an Editorial Committee to publish the report consisting of Steklov&Semashko&Zinoviev (or Ka-menev).
The committee shall undertake (1) to draft a plan for the report and to negotiate with the group for its approv-al; (2) to apply to the Party for money, with the group contributing no less than 500 rubles; (3) to do the final editing of the report (20 signatures) by (such-and-such) time.
The answer to this suggestion should come from the group as a whole.

CENTRAL COMMITTEE BUREAU ABROAD Dear Comrade, The enclosed letter * is the formal result of the talks with Poletayev which I began in Berlin, on instructions from the Duma group.
With the agreement of the group, I have formed an Edi-torial Committee consisting of Comrades Grigory (alter-* See previous letter.
—Ed.
nate—Kamenev), Steklov and Alexandrov to publish the report.
Since the group has undertaken to contribute no less than 500 rubles to cover the expenses, and the total cost of publishing the report has been estimated by us to run to 2,100-2,200 rubles, we propose that the remaining 1,600 rubles be issued from the Party (“trust”) funds 2 1 4 (and placed at the disposal of the Editorial Committee), to which representatives of the Bolshevik trend are agreed.

Since we have hitherto consulted with you on all cardinal steps, we consider it our duty to inform you of this.
At the last meeting Mark saw fit to say: “We ‘concilia-tors’ shall withdraw from the Technical Commission and the Organising Commission if you Bolsheviks persist in pursuing a ‘factional’ policy.
” We declare that we shall withdraw from the T.

(2) The split should be discussed with more tact, always choosing formulations to the effect that the liqui-dators have broken away, created and proclaimed a “com-plete break”, and that the Party ought not to tolerate them (“and the conciliators ought not to confuse issues”), and so on.

FRIMOU Dear Comrade, Two political emigrants, Nikita Pashev and Ivan Demidov-sky, worked at an airdrome in Kitil for a Mr.
Cherkez.
Mr.
Cherkez dismissed his workers without paying them the money due them.
But with Nikita Pashev things proved more complicated since he had been working on con-tract.
Cherkez wanted to get rid of N.
Pashev, knowing that Nikita and Ivan, being political emigrants, had to re-main silent.
He trumped up charges against Nikita Pashev, claiming that he had removed some bolts from an airplane.
Nikita was detained, and Ivan probably as well.
I know very well that both (Nikita Pashev and Ivan Demidovsky), being political emigrants, are incapable of anything of the kind.
I would therefore ask you, dear comrade, to inter-cede in the case, which may lead to the extradition of our comrades.
Please accept, dear comrade, my fraternal greet-ings.

Cher camarade, I am sitting in the British Museum and reading with interest Schweitzer’s pamphlets of the 60s; it is wonder-ful how they bear out the opinion of him as an oppor-tunist in the question of ways to unity! I obviously will not have the time to do everything need-ed to write about this.
I would therefore ask you to go (or send a reliable person) to the Bibliothèque Nationale without a day’s delay to find out what socialist literature of the 60s they have there.
The way to go about it is this: write down all the most important titles (exact dates and places of publication are important) and let them tell you what they haven’t got.
Add to the enclosed list (from Bebel and Mehring and Gust.
Mayer) and reply as soon as possible.

12 Dear Citizen, I have received your Circular No.
5.
I am enclosing an official communication * which I would ask you to for-ward to the secretaries of all the parties duly affiliated with the International Association.
I also have, dear citizen, a request to make in regard to your introduction to Circular No.
5: would you be so kind as to explain to me a point on which I am not quite clear.
The thing is this.
In the second sentence of your introduction you put forward what I think is a fine prin-ciple; you say that the secretariat is duty bound to pass on (to all organisations) documents submitted by organisa-tions duly affiliated with the International Association, and by members of the Bureau.
.
.
.
This is perfectly correct.
But, dear citizen, do you not think that the first sentence of your introduction, in which you say that you are com-municating to the parties affiliated with the Association a protest resolution sent, as you so kindly informed me, by Citizen Babin, clearly contradicts this principle? Does Babin represent an organisation duly affiliated with the Association, and if so, what organisation? Or perhaps Ba-bin is a member of the Bureau? If he is, what organisation does he represent? And what organisation affiliated with the Association is responsible to the Bureau for the Paris resolution? I shall be boundlessly grateful to you, dear citizen, if you dispel my doubts.

234 TO CAMILLE HUYSMANS Dear Citizen Huysmans, I fully agree with you, and, like yourself, believe that the Bureau cannot act as a go-between in polemics.
I also believe that the best and only way to prevent this is to circulate only those documents which you receive from the highest bodies of the parties represented in the Bureau and which concern these parties.
I was bound to inform you of the decisions of our Party conference which reconstitut-ed the Central Committee, which our Party did not have at the moment, and I would not of course have protested against the passing on of information emanating from an-other Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democrat-ic Labour Party, but I considered it my duty to protest against the circulation of polemics between groups abroad.
You also ask what I think of your draft appeal urging the convocation of a joint conference.
In my view this would not be advisable at the moment, and since I do not pretend to be impartial, I take the liberty to cite the opinion of the Poles (see Vorwärts).
The Poles refused to take part in our conference, but they also refused to partic-ipate in the conference the Bund wants to call, declaring that it would be a conference of liquidators.
It is better to wait; let us see whether the liquidators’ conference will take place and what it will do.
I shall send you shortly some rather interesting docu-ments which will give you a better idea of the state of affairs in the Russian S.

12 Werte Genossin, I do not know whether you have heard the sad news about our mutual friend who introduced me to you in Ber-lin—Suren Spandaryan.
He has been arrested in Baku.
His wife has written to his father that there is nobody to help him; she says he has nothing, not even bedding.
Nobody to take him milk, etc.
The father told me that he has many acquaintances in Baku and that he had written to one of them.
Why only to one, I do not know.
Spandaryan’s father lives here (Hotel Nicole, 19.
Rue Pierre Nicole, 19.
Paris).
He looks very sick and old.
His son had promised to do his best to send money to him from Baku—but couldn’t do it because of the arrest.
The father is now penniless and is threatened with eviction.
His situation is most grievous, I would say desperate.
We helped him with a small loan.
But I nevertheless decided to write to you.
You probably know some of Span-daryan’s friends and acquaintances in Baku and Paris.
His father has on more than one occasion forgotten to address letters he has mailed.
Because of this I am very much afraid that his letters will not reach Baku.
Do you know anybody in Baku whom one could write to about Suren and ask to take care of him? Furthermore, if you have mutual friends, it would be very necessary to take care of the father as well.
I have heard it said that he has a rich son in Yekaterinodar.
It would be a good thing if you were to write and impress on him that he should send enough money to enable the old man to pay his debts and leave from here.
I hope you will do whatever you can for both Spandaryans and drop me a line about it.
How are you getting on? I have been hoping to hear from you.
Have you managed to look into Social-Democraticliterature? Have you become a Social-Democrat and a Bol-shevik? I wish you everything of the best.
Yours, Lenin Vl.

* I am surprised not to have had a single letter from you.
It is essential for us to correspond more regularly and especially for you to write more often.
“Paris will run to seed,” everybody used to say.
This is now your responsi-bility, in other words, you must not allow that to happen.
Get the people together at least once a week, talk to them, organise them, see Alexei daily and put some spirit into the group through him.
You cannot “abandon your own” to the mercy of fate.
It will not do to disorganise what has been (so far) the main centre.

237 TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF P R A V D A 218 Dear Colleague, Received your parcel with files of Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda.
* Will you please follow it up with the issues of the old Zvezda which I am missing (you should have a list of these issues).
If you do not have the list of missing issues, let me know, and I shall send it at once.
I also received your detailed letter * concerning our co-operation.
We shall try to carry out as much as we can of this extremely broad programme.
But it must be underscored once again that it is absolutely impossible to carry on without: (1) money.
The office already owes 200 rubles, of which 100 rubles should have been sent by June 1, old style, and 100 rubles by June 15.
The debt must be paid without delay and the money sent punctually by the stipulated dates, as agreed; (2) it is necessary to send new books, works of reference, etc.
Without new books it is impossible to carry out even one-tenth of your co-operation programme.
In my previous letter I gave you a list of books and would ask you to let me know whether you can send them all.
Further, you ask in your letter “what other newspapers we should send”.
The list was sent you with the previous letter and I can only repeat my request that you inform me by telegram: “papers ordered”; otherwise there will be an interruption in the sending of articles.
We are making inquiries about Sinclair’s novel in Leip-zig.
But that is a translation of the English.
Or do you want to translate from the German translation? At your service, V.
Ulyanov * Your letter was postmarked June 18.
But we have not yet re-ceived Nevskaya Zvezda for June 17 !! Please see to it that the papers are mailed regularly.
P.
S.
As regards the agrarian question in particular, we especially need current publications—government and Zem-stvo.
Print a notice without fail in the next issue that the paper would like to receive all publications of the kind, promising to publish a list of them as well as reviews of the most important ones.

In the article by a “Non-Liberal Sceptic” * the word “ispolzovat” ** became “ispovedovat” ***!! Yet the handwriting of the author of the article is by no means difficult to make out.
More, it cannot but be familiar to the compositors and the proof-reader.
Lastly, the proof-reader should have easily caught the mistake from the meaning.
It is desirable to see to it that there should be fewer errors of this kind.

4 8 Printed from the original 239 TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF P R A V D A Dear Colleague, I am sending you the article “Some Results of Six Months’ Work”.
* You will see from the contents why I have sent this huge article to Pravda.
You could run it in four suc-cessive feuilletons set up in small type.
Each of the four articles could have a separate heading (for example: I.
Work-ers’ collections for the newspaper by months in 1912.
II.
Workers’ collections for the newspaper by districts.
III.
Workers’ collections for liquidationist and non-liquidationist newspapers.
IV.
The worker’s kopek for the workers’ newspaper).
I would very much like these articles, which are writ-ten exclusively for Pravda and addressed to its readers, to be published in Pravda.
I don’t think there could be any censorship trouble.
I agree of course to make changes required by the censors, but not to omit Chapter III.
If by any chance you should reject the article for Pravda, and if your colleagues reject it for Nevskaya Zvezda (for which it is far less suited), I shall get it published in one of the journals, however much I should dislike to.
At any rate, please reply as soon as possible or send the article back to me here.

221 You ask for a greater variety of subjects.
In this respect Y.

The paper has no literary criticism—reviews, essays or small paragraphs.
In my opini-on every contributor should be valued for his own specific subject matter.
Given a slightly more attentive attitude on your part, Y.

could no doubt contribute a bigger variety of items which would greatly enliven the workers’ newspaper.
Why did you kill my article on the Italian congress? * In general it wouldn’t be a bad thing to inform authors about rejected articles.

It is necessary to read them before going to Chemnitz and there to look up Pannekoek and make closer contact with him: Kautsky replied to him on some cardinal issues in an extremely opportunist way.
It is very desirable to make closer contact with the Left (especially Pannekoek, who now lends a hand in the cheap “game” played by Tyszka) and to carry on agitation among them for a principled rebuff to Kautsky.

We replied to the Vorstand.
It goes without saying that the Vorstand’s information is false, that it is a sheer invention by the liquidators.
We can say with certainty that this fable was given to the Vorstand by the Letts, Bundists or the Trotzky-Leute who recently held “their own” conference, which they call a Party conference, but which in reality was a confer-ence of liquidators.
So as not to make unsubstantiated statements, so as not to quote our organisational correspondence, we shall * Manuscript partly damaged.

confine ourselves to adducing only one printed document openly published in St.
Petersburg.
(The Vorstand would do well to cease once and for all to take things on faith.
) The St.
Petersburg Marxist daily Pravda printed in its issue No.
102, August 28 (September 10, new style), a let-ter from one of the biggest factories in Kharkov specifi-cally about the elections.
The letter states clearly and plainly that the “liquidator candidates” were “not an-nounced” and that they, the liquidators, “deny the need for a workers’ party” (Pravda No.
102, p.
4, col.
1).
From this alone the German comrades can see how shamelessly the Letts, the Bund, Trotsky and sundry pri-vate “informants” are deceiving them.
It is clearly a matter of enabling the same Trotsky, the Bund, the Letts or the Caucasians to lay hands on the money on behalf of angeblichen * “organisations”, whose existence neither the Vorstand nor anyone else can prove or verify.
Surely the German party with its 90 Social-Democratic newspapers can—if it does not want to put itself in an awk-ward position by blundering in serious matters—open a discussion on the question of the Social-Democratic Party in Russia and induce all the .
.
.
informants to come out into the open with documents bearing their signature.
Russia is after all not central Africa, and the German So-cial-Democratic workers would be able without much difficulty to grasp the truth and at the same time certain members of the Vorstand would be relieved of the neces-sity of listening to private and unverifiable tales.

POLETAYEV Dear Colleague, I was very happy to receive one of your rare letters.
Many, many thanks for the subscriptions to the journals.
I can send you the book by Litvinov whenever you want it.
I do not recall a book by Chistyakov.
What is it about, what sort of a book is it? 231 Your hopes that I am sufficiently well informed are, alas, entirely unfounded.
In fact, to me it sounds almost like mockery.
.
.
.
Of course I quite under-stand your reference to the “hurry-scurry”, but a political hurry-scurry, you know, seldom takes the form of silence or reserve.
As a contributor to Pravda on political questions I too experience the “hurry-scurry” and that is why I can-not remain silent even when the circumstances are not at all conducive to conversation (owing to the silence of the interlocutor).
In my view it would be extremely important before the elections on October 17 232 to set forth still more clearly and resolutely the basic principles of the anti-liquidationist platform, to print our own list once more in full, to warn against vacillation à la Sudakov 233 (strange, very strange that you say nothing on this score).
I am sending article after article about this.
Knock and it shall be opened unto you.
.
.
.
Is this applicable to your newspa-per? It would be advisable to put out an extra sheet on these questions on Wednesday.
It would cost some 100-200 rubles—but even that sum would be repaid tenfold by the success of the election campaign, for what we need are re-liable and lasting friends, do not forget that.
Don’t stint 100-200 rubles at the decisive moment, you will economise far more in the long run.
.
.
.
As regards the technicalities, it is important to give some attention to curbing the chair-man of the congress of representatives.
I would advise consulting lawyers by telephone and writing an article about the rights of members of the congress of represent-atives vis-à-vis the chairman.
I do not have the law at the moment (Legal Code, Vol.
II, 1892 edition, articles 179-91, general gubernia institutions), in any case the lawyers ought to know and will give clear practical advice on how to file complaints against the chairman and se-cure one’s rights.
Don’t grudge the expense of wiring me the election results.

I have his letter saying that this library was to be donated to the Social-Democratic Party when it was united, etc.

Communication with Pravda staff has been very unsatisfactory lately, especially after the unfortunate developments of the past few days.
243 This is very painful.
We would be very pleased if, now that you have tested the address and seen that your letter has reached us, you would write more about yourself, about the present Editorial Board of Pravda, about how Pravda is run, about its opponents, about Luch, and so on.

B.
KAMENEV Dear L.
B.
, I shall reply point by point.
1) About Haase’s letter to Ryazanov.
This “document” is private.
We do not have it.
We cannot refer to it.
For us to ask Haase (if only through the I.
S.
B.
) for an “explana-tion” is awkward, very awkward.
Your question whether “he (Haase) was given (by whom?) an opportunity to ‘explain things’” is irrelevant.
He always had and still has an opportunity.
He has even been told as much by Ryazanov.
Ergo, he does not want to.
And to the devil with him! But we will corner him and all the Germans, because now we have a document stating that the Vorstand gave money to the Letts&the Bund&the Caucasian region.
2) Your question if we “have someone better in view” is, forgive me, very strange.
And stranger still: “he (Haase) at least knows something”(??) (le préjugé est plus éloigné de la vérité que l’ignorance! * ) and “he is capable (?) of under-standing (??) the price (???) of ideological (????) differ-ences”.
.
.
.
Really, this is strange.
He cannot understand who does not want to.
And the German Vorstand (with Haase, its head) has demonstrated that it does not want to.
We are not looking for anyone “better”, we cannot and are not obliged to look.
That is not the point.
It is only necessary to reject what is deliberately “partial”.
The rest does not matter.
3) What is this about the “endorsement of the mandates of the opposition” in Basle? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for not having written a word about this to this day?? Who “endorsed”? The Russians? The Social-Democrats &the Socialist-Revolutionaries?? Who permitted them to interfere? How could the Russians interfere without getting the whole Polish delegation to cast its vote as laid down in the rules of the International? Did the whole Polish delegation vote or not? If it did, we need at any rate (be-* Prejudice is farther from the truth than ignorance!—Ed.
sides your account) a document signed by all the delegates who did the “endorsing”.
How could you, who have been here and know how acute the problem of the opposition is, have failed to realise the importance of such a document in a matter of this kind in general, and that for us in Cracow it is doubly important?? 4) If Muranov’s signature was there, drop a line [please] * to Huysmans saying that there was a misprint or an omis-sion in the reports and that you kindly ask him to make a correction in the official report, to insert Muranov, that you are referring to such-and-such a document, reminding him, etc.
5) You are going to write for the C.
O.
on the elections and on Basle, aren’t you? As regards the elections, read Steklov’s vile article in Neue Zeit and bear it in mind, without, of course, replying to him.
Hand in the article about Basle to the printers as quickly as you can and send us the proofs as soon as possible; for we have to discuss the matter: there are a number of impor-tant questions (how to write about Plekhanov? and about the Polish opposition?).
In my opinion, you should make it sharply-worded.
But there is no collective decision on this as yet, nor can there be without our article.
6) Honestly, L.
B.
, I simply cannot understand you— although we have been working together so long—when you now begin making “domestic scenes” about (a) the trip to Basle, (b) delegating you (as was proposed) to the meeting.
Why such a tone!? How can you take such an attitude?? Aren’t you ashamed to raise questions? What was so bad for the cause about your trip to Basle? Explain, for God’s sake! How you can repeat the pointless whining of Yuri and the Kiev people is in-com-pre-hensible! What was so bad for you? Explain! Now, about the meeting.
I must (a) drop my daily work for Pravda; (b) spend twice or three times as much time as you would; (c) spend twice or three times as much money * Manuscript partly damaged.
The word in square brackets has been inserted as context suggests.
—Ed.
—and there is no money; (d) walk into the trap prepared by our enemies who want to make the most of my maximum (how else could it be the way the war is going) irritation?? Tell me, for God’s sake, what’s come over you?? Why, if you wrote the pamphlet, should I have to go?? .
.
.
“It will at once make the whole thing look ridiculous”!? What does this mean?? Why did Martynov’s being with you in Basle not make things “look ridiculous”?? Why do you allow yourself to be taken in by the old wives’ tales of the Paris scandalmongers?? .
.
.
“It will at once tip the scales in favour of the O.
C.
” .
.
.
Now, really, that is being a little too naïve.
Since the Germans are against us (and that is a fact) the “scales” have already tipped in favour of the O.
C.
How can you fail to see this?? My presence would only make things ten times worse, for I am incapable of talking peaceably (like you) either with Haase or about Haase.
You know this per-fectly well! The point however is that it is not these “scales”, i.
e.
, in the Bureau, at the meeting, that are seriously decisive, it is the real alignment of forces that counts.
We have 6 curia workers in the Social-Democratic Duma group on the Jagi-ello question—6 and 6; Malinovsky writes me today: “we have 6 curia deputies&4 liquidators&2 wavering.
The Sibe-rians have not yet arrived.
” We shall mobilise the six representing the proletariat of Petersburg, Moscow and the South and fight the gossip and intrigues of Tyszka&Rosa&Ryazanov and others.
.
.
.
There you have the serious “scales”! And you know it! Why stage these “domestic scenes” when the fight is hard enough as it is?? “The Germans will take offence .
.
.
get angry”.
.
.
.
This has already happened.
And we shall send a protest about the Germans giving the money to the O.
C.
Let them get angry.
They are already involved.
We must inevitably fight with the Germans and began to do so with (a) the “Anonymus” &(b) Chemnitz.
Haase “replied” in Chemnitz.
The war is on, and you wax naïve: they’ll get angry, they’ll take offence.
I don’t understand you! I am thinking of replying to the Bureau’s proposals thus: (a) we shall turn down all the Germans for handingthe money to the Bund and the Caucasus; (b) we shall go to the meeting only with the expelled group of liquidators without the nationals; (c) preliminary condition—formal disavowal by them of the vile slander in Luch about the provocation in Warsaw.
The motives are clear.
Your opin-ion? Reply more precisely, more directly, more resolutely.
I shall go nowhere; if you carry the “scenes” to the point of refusal, I shall get Semashko delegated or.
.
.
.
* Is that what you want? Once again: were you right with your “ap-prehensions” about Basle? or was I right that no harm was done to the cause, but that both the cause and the pocket benefited? 7) The money crisis is serious.
We had a meeting of the C.
C.
with Koba.
244 It was decided to warn you urgently: look for earnings! You can count on 100 frs.
monthly for about three months&from Pravda for what you write, but after that nothing.
Think this over and let us have your answer as soon as possible.
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
From Pravda they write us: Alexinsky and Co.
(sic!) have offered articles on condition that their articles the editors do not agree with be published.
They replied: we would be glad to have your contribu-tions, but cannot accept such a condition, for our task now is to concentrate the forces of the anti-liquidators to com-bat the liquidators.
A splendid answer and perfectly correct, in my opinion.
Bear this in mind! What do Alexinsky and Co.
want? (What Co.
? Lunacharsky alone, or someone else? And who?) Is it just an intrigue, as I think (Luch, you see, is kinder, while Pravda turned me down, etc.

STALIN To Vasilyev 14/XII.
Dear Friend, We learned today that the board of the co-operative 245 is to be dissolved within a week.
There is therefore very little time left.
We earnestly ask you to take all steps to: 1) transfer Dyen 246 in good time to No.
5, 247 or at any rate make certain, concretely and with full guarantees, that the funds are in his hands.
The financial crisis is terribly acute.
Subscription money is now all we have.
To leave this in unreliable hands would be a crime! 2) It is necessary at once to prepare (or to take those already prepared by us and sent long ago) articles and statements by the six co-operators for Dyen and publish them without delay.
If we do not launch an energetic campaign for subscriptions, for donations, for support, we are lost.
3) Get Misha’s collegi-um 248 to pass a resolution against No.
16, * to counteract the liquidators’ resolutions.
4) See to it that the gathering of all (without exception) which has been finally decided upon is held—this is now trebly important.
We are drag-ging Spitsa in too.
5) Get Vasilyev out as soon as possible, otherwise you won’t be able to save him, and he is needed and has already accomplished the main thing.
* No.

Please reply to this letter as soon as possible and espe-cially about Pravda.

Best regards, Yours, ** P.
S.
The trip is possible only if undertaken immediately, if passports are obtained for everybody at once, without delay, if you see to it that there should be action, not prom-ises.
If it is postponed, they will all scatter and nothing will come of it.
It is extremely important to get everyone to take part simultaneously, for otherwise again there will be no decisions, no organisation, only promises, only talk.

You must do your best to put off the question of No.

1) For goodness’ sake, take the most energetic steps to get W.
* away from Krass and turn it over le-gally to Muranov, No.
5, and particularly to take the funds and the subscription money.
Without this we are lost.
Besides to allow the abuses to go on would be criminal.
2) Arrange a meeting over there of all six before they have time to scatter.
There is plenty of time now; they will manage to do everything after the meeting as well.
3) Be sure to get the six to publish a statement in W.
(even the five, at a pinch; we cannot delay any longer and wait).
4) Impress it finally and seriously upon Shibayev ** and all his colleagues that they must write here twice a week and correspond conscientiously.
Without this it is impos-sible to work together.
5) The same applies to Vetrov.
He has not written once, and he could easily have sent even the text of the liquida-tors’ declaration.
This is inexcusable.
6) Did you get the draft resolutions for Misha’s colle-gium? Do your level best to get them adopted.
The letters were sent mainly to the bank address.

Just learned of the defeat.
You must get Misha’s collegium to adopt a resolution against (the one No.
3 had), with the addition that the decision of the Duma group is a decision of seven semi-Party people, and circulate it in the districts.
If even the base resolution of the 7 Mensheviks for Jagiello (and for the Bund) does not finally impel No.
6 to join us, the five must speak out in W.
and speak out very sharply.

being no certainty about his not being a Social-Democrat, then the 7 simply fooled the 6, picked their pockets.
In Rusanov’s place, on arriving later, I would not have joined the Social-Democratic Duma group and would have raised a terrific row.
But if it was known that Rusanov was not a Social-Democrat, then it was wrong to accept the base resolu-tion without a protest.
At any rate I would advise the Petersburg Committee to adopt a resolution on approximately these lines (repeat the resolution which No.
3 has): The Petersburg Committee strongly condemns the res-olution of the 7 members of the Duma group who: a) did not obtain exact information about the Social-Democratic workers in Warsaw; b) made no mention in the resolution of the protest of all the Polish Social-Democrats against Jagi-ello; c) made no mention of the two (out of three) electors from the Warsaw workers; d) represented the bourgeois vote for the P.
P.
S.
as evidence of “the growth of political consciousness among the bourgeoisie”, whereas it could only be a matter of an honest man gaining by two thieves falling out; e) deduced Jagiello’s Social-Democratism from his “statement” and from the bloc of a section of the So-cial-Democrats with a non-Social-Democratic party against the Polish Social-Democrats; f) and what is most important —drew an incredible distinction between “questions of the internal life of Social-Democracy” and “questions of po-litical activity in the Duma, thereby encouraging the sepa-ration of the latter from the former”.
The Petersburg Committee condemns those who have taken such an anti-Party step and thereby divorced them-selves from the “internal life of Russian Social-Democ-racy”.

Dear Friends, We are distressed not so much by the defeat over No.
16 as by the inexcusable silence of friends (of the six or at least the five) on the matter, and the light-hearted attitude to things.
For this means killing the cause, ruining everything.
There is no declaration yet from the five or the six, because they have not yet broken away from the grip of dishonest people.
(No.
3 says himself: it smacks of a criminal act!) Remember, for heaven’s sake, that we shall all be responsible if this terrible assumption proves correct.
But the cheque must, at all costs, be made out in the name of No.

Dear Friends, The news of the inclusion by the liquidators of the point about “cultural-national autonomy” filled us with indig-nation! There are limits to everything! The people who have broken up the Party now want completely to destroy the Programme as well.
Even where the arch-con-ciliator Plekhanov draws the line, they do not.
This is im-possible.
It cannot be tolerated, and.

* Resistance and protest must be organised at all costs.
We must present an ultimatum: let us speak up, [let] them read out this bilge, this cultural-national autonomy, etc.
! Exert every effort to do this, if only through the five (better five with the Party policy than six wavering between the Party and its liquidators).
The base resolution about No.
16, the vile insertion of the cultural-national autonomy point, and the preten-sions to “poke” into the newspaper question clearly show that there can be no illusions about “peace” with such people.
251 They started the war by these moves.
It is necessary to give considered thought to this war and to wage it energetically.
For this, besides the above, two steps are essential: (1) to submit written protests signed by the five threatening to appeal to the Party organisations—on all the above-mentioned and similar questions; (2) arrange a meeting here of the live or the six (this is imperative!) and finally decide on a line of action.

Dear friends, we received your news today that the majority of the co-operative has again re-stored the national-cultural autonomy clause to please the Jewish nationalists and the rest of that company.
What is this—a mockery of the six? Do these gentry not under-stand that by interpreting the Programme to please this company they are thereby releasing the minority fromsubmission? Why, it is a public disgrace that they should gain the upper hand by making use of one chance vote of a muddled Menshevik, or perhaps relying in this case on No.
16.
We do not know what the six have done on this question But how can we silently submit, how can No.
3 agree to read such bilge publicly (and thereby assume responsibility), how could the six (or at any rate No.
3 alone) not come out at once with a statement in Dyen that these gentry are mak-ing a mockery of the Programme and heading for a split— this we cannot possibly understand.
For if nothing is said, the Jewish Marxists * will walk all over us tomorrow.
After all, there must be some limit.
And if these gentlemen think that the minority is obliged to submit even when the Programme is obviously being torn to bits, they are badly mistaken.
We sent in one general article on cultural-national au-tonomy before your letter came (we quoted Plekhanov: the Caucasians and the Bund are adapting socialism to national-ism).
Today we are sending articles directly against the co-operative.
We would ask you to see that they are printed as soon as possible, and we believe that if it is not too late you should take resolute measures to prevent changes in the Programme.
It is necessary to fight, since the others are taking such steps.
As regards the merging of Vechernaya Pochta ** and Dyen you will all doubtless adopt the resolu-tion, with the exception of the pro-liquidators.
This of course was trickery on their part, and we shall not agree to join them in anything.
Why are only four coming? We earnestly beg you to get all six to come.
This is extremely important.

1912.
252 Either there is some misunderstanding or else there exists a resolution of the Bureau unknown to me.
Le Peuple (Brussels) wrote: “As regards representation of the Russian socialist parties in the Bureau, the situation remains unchanged” (Le Peuple, 30.
XI.
1912).
Is there another resolution of the Bureau? If so, I trust you will be kind enough to inform me of it.
If not, the Central Committee of our Party has the right to appoint its own representative.
Why is this “only temporary”? Of course a new decision of the Bureau is always possible, but in this sense any representation is “temporary”.
Is there a Bureau resolution to the effect that both Rus-sian Social-Democratic “factions” (?) (the January and August conferences of 1912?) are requested to come to an agreement on the question of representation in the Bureau? I shall be much obliged if you would inform me of that resolution and the documents (if any) received from the “Organising Committee” of the liquidators.

271 TO I.
A.
PYATNITSKY Dear Comrade Albert, I would like to have a talk with you about the resolu-tion of the meeting on the non-Russian organisations.
* You regard it as “diplomacy”—and that is a great mistake.
In what do you see diplomacy? First of all in the fact that we raise a hue and cry against the Executive of the P.
S.
D.
—“and all information comes from the members of the opposition”.
This is glaringly incorrect! That Tyszka in the Executive evokes opposition and discontent among the P.
S.
D.
we have known for years.
Everyone who has worked with the Executive knows this.
The development of this opposition since 1910 has been in plain sight.
In the spring of 1912 Tyszka and Co.
dismiss the War-saw Committee, which they announce to be dependent on the secret political police, and set up a committee of “their own”.
In the autumn elections take place.
And what happens? All the worker-electors of Warsaw belonging to the Social-Democratic Party are found to be on the side of the opposi-tion! I checked this fact.
The names of the electors are Zalewski and Bronowski.
Malinovsky saw them and verified the fact himself.
Isn’t this proof enough?? On the side of the opposition we find also both the or-ganisations abroad and Lodz.
Tyszka’s policy of manoeuvring has long been heading for a fall.
It is inevitable.
The 1912 January Conference (which did not touch at all on the subject of Tyszka’s (= the Executive’s) split with the opposition) had pointed * A reference to the resolution of the Cracow meeting on the “Non-Russian Social-Democratic Organisations” (see present edition, Vol.
18, pp.
465-66).
—Ed.
to this course of events which it appraised in prin-ciple.
The federation of the worst type 254 is breaking up.
A comeback (to 1907-11) is impossible.
This has got to be understood.
There was a similar period in Austria: a separate C.
C.
of the nationals; no separate C.
C.
of the Germans.
In Austria this did not last: from here the road leads either to complete federation, or to complete unity.
With us, too, semi-federation (1907-11) cannot last; no effort must be spared to make the Party workers grasp this thoroughly.
We are out for complete unity—from below—in the na-tional question as well.
This is possible.
We had and have it in the Caucasus (4 nations).
We had it in 1907 in Riga (the Letts, Lithuan-ians and Russians) and in Vilna (Lithuanians, Letts, Poles, [Russians], * Jews)—in both these cities against the separatism of the Bund.
In Austria federation ended in separatism and break-down of the united party.
2 5 5 With us it would be crimi-nal to countenance separatism of the Bund and cover it up.
You see “diplomacy” (2°) in the fact that we blame the Bund and “grant almost an amnesty to the Lettish C.
C.
, which is following the Bund”.
No.
You are mistaken.
This is not diplomacy.
The Let-tish Social-Democratic workers have always stood for unity from below, have always been for territorial autonomy, i.
e.
, have taken an anti-separatist, anti-nationalist stand.
This is a fact.
You cannot deny it.
The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from this is: the Lettish C.
C.
is a deviation from the true path on the part of one of the bodies of the revolutionary proletariat among the Lettish Social-Democrats.
* Manuscript partly damaged.
Words in square brackets have been inserted as context suggests.
—Ed.
In the Bund, on the other hand, there is no such true path, there is no proletariat, no mass organisations—noth-ing but a circle of intellectuals (Lieber&Movich&Vinitsky —out-and-out opportunists and long-standing “bosses” of the Bund) and circles of artisans.
It would be a glaring untruth to confuse the Bund with the Letts.
The “national” question in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
has come up for discussion.
[This is inescapable.
] The breakup of the non-Russian organisations is no accident.
And we should exert every effort towards explaining the matter, towards renewing the struggle of the old Iskra.
We are against federation in principle.
We are for uti-lising the deplorable experience of semi-federation (1907-11).
We are in favour of a campaign for unity from below.
The comrades who used to work among the Jewish Social-Democratic workers of Russia or who are generally famil-iar with the conditions, should collect [information on] the harm of Bund separatism.
The Bund wrecked the Stock-holm [resolution] (1906).
256 It united nowhere locally itself (the Letts never did anything like it).
Does anyone really believe that we shall forget this and allow ourselves again to be fed with empty promises?? Never! Unite in Warsaw, Lodz, Vilna, and so on, gen-tlemen “uniters” of the Bund! [I would be glad] if you would show this letter to the Bolsheviks interested [in the national question and if] work could be started everywhere on a serious study of the question and the collection of material (Russia’s ex-perience) against the Bund “separatists”.

* I enclose a reply cou-pon for 20 pfennigs.
I am very pleased to see that on the main point you come to the same conclusion as I did in the polemic with Tugan-Baranovsky and Volkstümler 14 years ago, namely, that the realisation of surplus-value is possible also in a “ purely capitalist” society.
** I have not yet seen Rosa Luxem-burg’s book, but theoretically you are quite correct on this point.
It seems to me, though, that you have placed in-sufficient emphasis on a very important passage in Marx (Capital, Vol.
II, p.
442), 257 namely, where Marx says that in analysing annually produced value, foreign trade should be entirely discarded (I am quoting from the Russian translation).
The “dialectics” of Luxemburg seem to me (judging also from the article in Leipziger Volkszeitung) to be eclecticism.
Has any other organ of the press reviewed Rosa Luxemburg’s book? Hamburger Echo? 258 Bour-geois organs? One more question.
Bremer Bürger-Zeitung (1912, No.
256) incorrectly reported the meeting of the International So-cialist Bureau in October.
Either the Luxemburg clique, or a liquidator, or a scoundrel sympathising with the liquidators, misled the editors and attributed to Haase the words: “Lenin has simply misled the International.
” The liquidators, naturally, repeated this lie in their newspaper (Luch in St.
Petersburg) and added a vicious comment.
The Central Committee of our Party (the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Russia) wrote to Haase.

He and his wife have now energetically taken in hand Prosveshcheniye.
He has raised a little money, and we hope that thanks to their energy and assistance we shall succeed in putting up a small Marxist journal against the renegade liquidators.
I think you, too, will not refuse help for Prosveshcheniye.

POLETAYEV For Krass Dear Friend, I was very glad to get your letter of February 2 and ex-ceedingly regret that we have so far not been able to es-tablish regular correspondence, despite a number of at-tempts on our part.
The lack of such a correspondence gives rise to misunderstandings.
I welcome your criticism of the withdrawal from Luch, as I welcome all criticism from Russia: the absence of criticism makes a dead thing of it all.
In this case, however, your criticism is incorrect, and I simply don’t know from what side to start deal-ing with it.
265 I shall wait until the next letter.
As regards “reforms” in a certain newspaper, I must say that your absence is very regrettable.
Frankly, I consider the organi-sation of this business by you to be a historic service, and your closing down of the “big sister” * and your “semi-absence” in the summer to be a great mistake.
266 But the past is gone and done with.
We must make use of its lessons for the future.
The plan for a big newspaper is excellent.
I am convinced that two newspapers are needed—a big one for 5 kopeks and a small one for 1 kopek, and the present paper should be worked into “a small one”.
Publication of pamphlets and books of 5-10 sheets is another good idea.
We are taking this up, too, energetically.
We would be very, very glad if you would take this in hand and we could succeed in co-operating more systematically and effectively * Nevskaya Zvezda.
—Ed.
than in the spring and summer of 1912.
An indispensable condition for this is a personal meeting and regular correspondence.
Gorky has now started very energetically to assist Prosveshcheniye and turn it into a big magazine.
The publication of a big newspaper and books has every chance of becoming a tremendous job of tremendous im-portance and usefulness.
All the more important is it to have proper organisation from the outset.
Experience has convinced us most fully that any attempt to reach an agreement (as you suggest) with Plekhanov, Rozhkov, etc.
, is hopeless.
We are beginning at the other end.
And we are getting better results.
You know, of course, that Alex-insky and Dnevnitsky came without any agreement with us.
Given correct and firm tactics, this will hold true still more in the case of a big newspaper and the publication of books.
We are fully convinced of this.
Firm tactics— keeping the leadership by the former group—enlistment not by contract, but as contributors—all these conditions are categorical for us.
We shall find quite enough contrib-utors, I am sure, both for a big newspaper and for books and for a big magazine.
As for Bogdanov, for instance, even co-operation with him is impossible: this is clear from his new writings.
267 With Alexinsky and Dnevnitsky (Ple-khanov) it is possible, and remuneration will widen this circle of contributors fivefold.
I await an immediate reply: 1) whether you agree to the above or not; 2) if not, what your plan is; 3) how much money is needed; 4) how much you can raise; 5) how you define or plan your participation in the business as regards sphere of competence, etc.
An-swer as precisely as possible.
We must act quickly.

Take this into consideration and write a very careful and very tactful editorial note.
You should not have asked Plekhanov’s and Martov’s con-sent for disclosing the names of the anonymous writers.
If they refuse to give it (which they certainly will), you will be in a fix, yet we are entitled and obliged to disclose the names of the anonymous writers in the old Iskra; this should be done at all costs.
It should have been done without asking consent.

HERMAN Dear Comrade, We shall be living at Poronin till October 1 (Galizien, address: Herrn Ulianow), 4-6 hours from Cracow by the Zakopane line.
Write to the new address.
Thanks for the leaflet of your C.
C.
which you sent me.
273 Discuss as quickly as you can and when decided let me know whether, for the purpose of general agitation before the con-gress, you wish to issue a platform of the Lettish Bolshe-viks (or partyists, or anti-liquidators).
I think it ought to be done.
If you haven’t the money, it could be hectographed.
I think that special emphasis in the platform should be made on three points: (1) The liquidators’ renunciation of revolutionary tac-tics.
Their appraisal of the moment is a (veiled) liberal one.
This should be made clear.
(2) About the liquidators; reprint (or quote in detail Luch No.
101, editorial) and tell the Lettish workers the truth.
(3) The national question.
Separatism and federalism of the Bundists, which have “won” the liquidators.
The harm of cultural-national autonomy.
Would it not be better if your group moved resolutions on these questions? Or would it be better to write a plat-form? What would be more convenient for pre-congress agitation and for the election of congress delegates? Write your opinion (and that of your friends).
If a resolution or a platform is needed we could help write it.
What is the time limit? When is the congress? 274 All the best, Yours, Lenin Written prior to May 6 , 1 9 1 3 Sent from Cracow to Berlin First published in 1 9 3 5 in Proletarskaya Revolutsia No.

SHKLOVSKY Dear Sh.
, Please note my change of address.
We have come out here into the country near Zakopane for a mountain air cure (we are at a height of about 700 metres) for Nad.
Konst.
’s goitre.
I had been warned: if you neglect it it will be irreparable; take her at once to see Kocher in Berne, he’s first-class, a celebrity.
.
.
.
On the one hand Kocher’s a surgeon.
Surgeons like to use the knife, and an opera-tion here, I daresay, is extremely dangerous and extremely doubtful.
.
.
.
On the other hand people are treated with mountain air and rest.
A “rest” is hardly practicable with us, owing to the nervous lives we lead.
And this illness is caused by nerves.
We tried an electricity cure for 3 weeks.
Results—nil.
Nothing has changed—the same bulging eyes, and swollen neck, and palpitations of the heart—all the symptoms of goitre.
Could you make inquiries concerning Kocher? I don’t know how to go about it, and I want advice.
Couldn’t you go with somebody, a student or a doctor, to consult Ko-cher? Or do you think he would not want to talk withoutseeing the patient? Or could one have a talk with him on presentation of a letter from the doctor in attendance here (that is, in Cracow)? If inquiries of a serious nature can be made at all in Berne concerning Kocher or with Kocher personally (the latter would be best of all, of course) I would be much obliged to you.
Should inquiries point to the need of a journey to Berne, drop me a line as to Kocher’s reception arrangements, when he goes away for the sum-mer, and how we are to fix up in Berne, in some hospital (is it very expensive?) or otherwise.
All the best, and thanking you in advance for the trou-ble you are taking.

275 In my opinion, that scoundrel Semkovsky (Grigory is sending you Kampf) deserves an answer in a full voice only, not like that given to Steklov in Neue Zeit.
Write briefly but firmly and strongly about the traitors to both socialism and democracy, about the blacklegging newspaper Luch, about the bulk of the workers who are following the lead of Pravda.
If the opportunist Austrians refuse to print it, we shall publish it in the report to the Vienna congress of 1914.
276 I am strongly against any writ-ing “keyed to the meanness” of the opportunists of Neue Zeit or Kampf.
What is your opinion? Yours, LeninI am for writing to Kampf apart from Ryazanov.
That “honest broker” will mess the thing up, complicate it by outward courtesy and inward meanness.
Better go direct and get a direct reply.
If Ryazanov wants to “help” (h’m, h’m), let him do so on the side.

He publishes accounts of the moneys received by the group in the So-cial-Democratic newspapers of St.

According to the newspapers the Russian workers, since the beginning of the general strike in Belgium, have been making col-lections “for the Belgian workers”.

I have no doubt that the 800&700 francs received by you were donated by the Russian workers for the Belgian workers.
I shall write to Muranov, and if these sums are of a different designation (which is most unlikely) I shall let you know.

understand what’s what, but men like Berzin virtually help the liquidators.
They are servants of the liquidators.
Send me a translation (into Russian or German, whichever you find easiest) of Berzin’s whole article.
Berzin should be given a detailed and sharp reply.
Regards! Yours, Lenin Having only a short excerpt from you, all I can say against Berzin for the time being is this: Berzin tries to present the matter as if the “Bolsheviks”, or rather the 1912 January Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, are effecting a split by ignoring the Stockholm decision.
Berzin shows by this that he is simply an ignoramus.
He does not know what the Stockholm decision is about.
The Stockholm Congress did not accept federation.
It accepted an agreement with the non-Russians (that is, the Poles, Letts and the Bund).
279 That agreement called for union of non-Russians local-ly.
Why does Berzin side-step this? Through ignorance or to cover up the liquidators? Proof—the decision of the Party at the 1908 December Conference (i.
e.
, two and a half years after Stockholm).
This decision reads (see p.
46 of the pamphlet All-Rus-sia Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
of December 1908): (§1) “The Conference directs the C.
C.
to take steps to-wards effecting union of the local organisations .
.
.
wherever this, despite the decision of the Stockholm Congress, has not yet been done”, (§2) “amalgamation should be based on the principle of unity”.
The Conference “strongly declares against amal-gamation being based on the principle of federalism”.
2 8 0 And Berzin, after this, has the impudence to assure us that the Stockholm Congress accepted federation!! Berzin is distorting the facts! It is the Bundists who did not carry out the decision of the Congress and the Party, since they did not effect unity, but effected federation against the decision of the Party.
The January Conference condemns the Bundists and con-demns federation.
281 If the Lettish C.
C.
did not attend the January Conference (against the will of the Confer-ence that invited it) it is its own fault.
Berzin defends liquidator splitters and Bundists, he de-fends federation against the Party.

RUDIS-GIPSLIS 7/VI.
1913 Dear Comrade, I have received and read the translation of Berzin’s whole article.
It is a good article.
The only bad thing about it is that passage that roused my ire.
But I asked you right away to send me the whole article, thus showing that I considered it necessary to read it as a whole.
While scolding Berzin for part of his article, I asked you to send me the whole article.
It follows from this that you were rather hasty in forwarding to Berzin my angry comment on this part of his article.
Berzin has written me a letter in which he says that I was probably ill-informed.
(Naturally, one cannot be well informed of a whole article from just one part of it!) Berzin’s whole article convinces me that he cannot be put on a par with Braun.
Berzin’s article, I repeat, is a good article; it leads one to think that the difference of opinion between us (concerning appraisal of the Stock-holm decision, etc.
) does not involve any basic principles.
It is hardly worth beginning an immediate discussion of this difference in the press.
It looks as if Berzin is coming with us.
If you have already sent a reply (for the press) to Berzin, I would advise you to hold it up and send it to me: we shall talk it over.
Let me know as soon as you can what you have done with my draft of a platform.

We earnestly wish you success.

Petersburg First published in 1 9 6 0 in Istorichesky Arkhiv No.
2 Printed from a typewritten copy found in police records 291 TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF P R A V D A Dear Colleagues, I received the issues of the enlarged Pravda only today, 16.
VI.
1913, and hasten to congratulate the editorial staff and contributors.
I wish you every success.
The important thing now, in my opinion, is not to forget that we must fight to win 1 0 0,0 0 0 readers.
For this we must (1) have a small, one-kopek, extremely popular Sunday supplement.
Write without fail, giving your opinion on this, and also information on the estimates: i.
e.
, how much extra money the enlarged format has taken.
And what the monthly expenses now are, how much more than previously.
The great (and sole) danger for Pravda now is the loss of the broad readership, loss of a position to fight for it.
This is the first business point, and I would ask you earnestly to acquaint the publisher with all the business points and kindly let me have your answer.
(2) On the question of the 7-hour day for postal employ-ees, etc.
, the editors have made an obvious mistake.
Weare all prone to make mistakes, and there is nothing par-ticularly wrong in that.
But, in persisting in their mistake, the editors, for a long time to come, if not for always, are “leaving a thorn”, marring their reputation and position both in Russia and in Europe.
I was very pleased to see from the secretary’s letter that not all the members of the Editorial Board stood by the mistake.
I earnestly advise you to re-examine the question and take a different stand in print (by publishing article by G.
Z.
unsigned, in the name of the editors).
Two lines would suffice: “Having re-examined the matter, the editors have come to this con-clusion”—followed by G.
Z.
’s article.
Or: “Having re-examined the matter at a fuller meeting of the Editorial Board and contributors”.
This is worse than simply “hav-ing re-examined”.
283 Let the liars from Luch dance a cancan for once over this rectification—only false shame can prevent it being made.
It would be 1,000 times worse if Luch were forever able to point to this error.
An error rectified is an error no more.
Unrectified it becomes a festering sore.
In such cases one must have the courage to have it operated on at once.
It won’t be very pleasant, failing this, to have a number of Pravda friends—both individual writers and organs of the press—dissociating themselves from Pravda’s stand.
Will you please discuss all this and drop me a line without delay.
(3) As regards Y.
K.
I have already written once.
His article on Alexeyenko is excellent.
The author, of course, can give such articles regularly.
But you do not pay him— it’s a disgrace!! He writes me that he is going to stop writing.
You couldn’t imagine, I trust, that the enlarged format would involve extra expenses on paper and print-ing alone.
Naturally, you calculated on an unavoidable increase of expenditure on the literary side too.
Y.
K.
should top the list.
He has nothing else to live on now.
We cannot afford to lose such a contributor to both Pravda and Prosveshcheniye.
I therefore advise you most strongly to immediately adopt a decision to pay Y.
K—v 75 (sev-enty-five) rubles a month.
This is the minimum for a reg-ular contributor to both newspaper and journal; don’t forget the literary criticism section, too, which alwaysleaves much to be desired and without which a “big” news-paper is impossible.
Will you please give me your reply on this immediately.
I have a letter from Y.
K.
in the tone of an ultimatum, and I consider it my duty to warn the editors and publisher of Pravda that to run an enlarged paper without the services of such a contributor is a thing I don’t know who can think of.
(4) Vitimsky’s article in No.
123 is a very felicitous one in my opinion.
I congratulate the author.
As for Stal, I think it ought to be reprinted: it’s good! 284 I am enclosing a reply to Vitimsky, * which, I think, you ought to read (I am not sure whether Vitimsky’s letter is a personal one; I don’t think it is).
(5) Alexinsky’s letter concerning “Controversial Is-sues” ** has been lying in the editorial office for a month, we have been told.
I cannot understand this attitude!! The editors, apparently, do not know the position, do not know the history of the Vperyod group, and have fallen into an error with Mr.
Bogdanov (about this separately).
Why could not Alexinsky’s letter have been forwarded to us here?? This is necessary in order to discuss the one and only Vperyodist who had the sense to revolt against the vile empirio-monism and similar abominations which dis-grace the proletarian party.
In publishing Bogdanov’s men-dacious letters, 285 the editors have made it difficult to arrange a general discussion regarding Alexinsky: his let-ter, too, may be worthless, but we have to talk it over.
For that purpose we ask you to send his letter on to us as quick-ly as possible, and generally send such things to us.
(6) In regard to the Bogdanov incident I am sending a separate letter to the editors and publisher of Pravda.
*** This question is extremely serious.
I am loath to come out against the editors of Pravda in print—we have worked together too long—but for me to support otzovism is a sin a 100 times worse than supporting liquidationism—not * See present edition, Vol.

only worse, but more dishonest.
Frankly, I would be ob-liged to come out in print too against such support, which has become clear through publication of Mr.
Bogdanov’s letter.
If this is a slip, let’s rectify it.
If it is not, we shall fight.
Send us Alexinsky’s letter.
Very important.

I wrote to Pravda about Alexinsky and asked them to send me his letter.
* In regard to Bogdanov’s lie, I wrote a furious letter with an ultimatum that it be published.
We shall see.
Otherwise I shall go to Prosveshcheniye.
((I wrote to Prosveshcheniye about your article too: I am wholly for it—re the meeting of liberals and Pravda with Luch.
)) With regard to Alexinsky I advise putting the question straightforwardly and honestly, in a comradely way.
You are going to consult against Lunacharsky? Bon! Mais alors de deux choses une ** : either you revolt in print both against the philosophical (c’est déjà fait*** ) and the otzovist wing of Vperyod and you declare that there were both a philosophically reactionary and a politically anarchistic tend-ency in this group.
I (Alexinsky) am glad to be rid of both.
In that case we can accept an honest bloc.
With old squabbles forgotten, we shall welcome a contributor (a 100 times less valuable than Plekhanov) to both Pravda and Prosveshcheniye.
Or you are shuffling? In that case go alone.
You will be a casual contributor, and we wash our hands.

There are rumours here that Plekhanov is going to Beat-enberg round about the 10th of July.
Have you heard any-thing about this in Paris? There’s no need to tell Alexinsky about the school for the time being.
We still have time to do that if need be.

I strongly advise you to go to Berne: you must receive treatment, and Kocher is the only one who can cure you.
I have made inquiries of every kind, looked up medical literature (a big book by the son, Albert Kocher, on goitre), consulted physicians in Berne, and I speak from experi-ence.
Write to Professor Kocher in September asking him to make a definite appointment (and mentioning that you dis-pose only of such-and-such a sum, otherwise you’ll have to face the unpleasant prospect of haggling with the tight-fisted Frau Professor).
He will answer, fixing a date when he can receive you.
Then you can start out.
Life in Berne is cheap.
We’ll give you introductions to Shklovsky and Shenderovich—they will help you.
In a few months you will forget that you were an invalid.
All the best.
We shall be seeing you soon.

Petersburg First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXV Printed from the original302 TO THE EDITORS OF Z A P R A V D U A letter to the Editors Dear Comrade Editors, Allow me, in the columns of your newspaper, to announce our reply to the many people from the Far North, the West, East and other places, who have written to us for information about the liquidators’ “campaign” against the “insurance” expert, Comrade X.
The liquidators accused him of duplicity, of serving both the employers and the workers.
298 What does the organisation do in the case of such accu-sations? It calls together representatives of different bodies serv-ing the labour movement and authorises them to investi-gate the matter.
That is what it did.
The findings of the com-mittee of representatives from five bodies (1.
the Editorial Board of Pravda; 2.
the Editorial Board of Prosveshcheniye; 3.
the Editorial Board of the Polish Marxist organ; 4.
the six Social-Democratic deputies in the Duma; 5.
the Chair-man of the Metalworkers’ Union) were published in No.
12 of Za Pravdu for October 17.
* The committee found.
— — that the allegation of the liquidators “is untrue”; — — that X.
, having given up working for the employers, thereby fulfilled his duty.
In the previous issue (No.
11 of Za Pravdu for October 16) A.
Vitimsky made it amply clear that X.
was “guilty” only of leaving the employers to serve the labour move-ment.
Vitimsky added that he had communicated to the secretary of Za Pravdu the names of the liquidators working as secretaries of employers’ bodies.
** And what did the liquidators reply? They made no at-tempt to deny either Vitimsky’s statement or the fact that X.
had given up working for the employers.
Nor did they attempt to form any kind of committee * This refers to the article (unsigned) “Liars!”—Ed.
** This refers to the article “On ‘Criminals’” by A.
Vitimsky (M.
S.
Olminsky).
—Ed.
from among “their own” seven deputies, or from any trade uni-on, or from any “leading body” of Letts, Jews or Caucasians.
They did nothing of the kind! People devoted to the organisation set up a committee, investigate the matter and adopt a decision.
The liberal hacks of Novaya Rabochaya(??) Gazeta, who are independent of the workers’ organisations, are contin-uing their campaign of vicious lies and slander!! They are trying to fool simpletons and ignoramuses by accusing X.
of “duplicity” on the grounds that he secretly began, under a pseudonym, to help the workers, though he had not yet given up his job for the employers!! * Clearly! the workers are turning away with disgust from these contemptible anonymous slanderers from the liqui-dators’ rag of a newspaper, which is supported by the bour-geoisie.
But that is not enough.
Turning away is not enough.
A shameless smear campaign against a person is an old de-vice of the liquidators, who are out to destroy the organisa-tions of the workers.
No organisation is possible without an organisational rebuff to such a method of political “struggle”.
What should such an organisational rebuff consist in? Every worker must demand that the liquidators, from whom Marxists have turned away with contempt, should set up a committee of “their own” from “their” seven mem-bers, their “own” “leading body” of Jews, Letts, Caucas-ians, etc.
Let them try to arrive at “their own” decision and communicate it to the International.
Then we shall brand these slanderous rascals before the whole world.
While these scoundrels, these dirty characters, are hid-ing behind anonymous articles in the liquidators’ newspa-per, let every union of workers charge its executive with the investigation of this matter, by collecting all docu-ments and information from everywhere, by checking the decision of the Marxist committee of five bodies and adopt-ing a decision of their own.
Universal condemnation of the slanderers, a universal * Articles in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta: “Call Them to Account” (in Nos.
55 and 56) and “To the Pillory!” (in No.

demand: “Retract your base slander, or we shall not let you enter a single organisation”—that should be the reply of the working class, the organisational reply to the wreck-ers of the organisation.

* Our representative’s telegram, which I received yesterday, says on this question only: “unification entrust-ed to executive.
” And so the question is not clear.
301 Just in case, and subject to the extremely important reservation that there should be no haste in publishing it, I suggest the following text of an editorial statement (see-ing that the “storm” has already been raised in the dirty tea-cup of the Burenin-Gamma newspaper).
The decision of the International Socialist Bureau to call a conference of Russia’s Social-Democrats—those work-ing in Russia, of course, and not the shadows of them abroad—fully meets with our approval.
Such a conference will help most clearly to expose the treachery to the Party on the part of the liquidator gentry and the Burenin methods of fellows like Gamma, of whom it is high time that Social-Democracy rid itself.
Tomorrow (or the day after, at the latest) I shall prob-ably receive a detailed report from London.
I shall then write to you immediately again, and if it is necessary not to publish the statement I am sending you (i.
e.

This will mean, consequently, that page 3 is not to be published.

1913 Re the article you recommended for publication.
Dear Colleague, I received the article “For a Common Banner” * and in all honesty I must say that it is no good at all.
Frankness and candour above all—don’t you agree? The author has absolutely failed to understand the state of affairs in Russia and has let himself be carried away— to put it more mildly—by a spirit of, let us say, excessive amicability towards the Gothamite Mensheviks.
Russia is going through a process of restoration and con-solidation of the Marxist workers’ party.
The discussions and resolutions, which raise in the author such a short-sighted sneer, are of tremendous educative and organisa-tional significance.
The author’s ironical reference to the “Hurray shouting” is sheer liberal irony, the irony of an intellectual who is completely out of touch with the work-ing-class movement.
How is it that in no other opposition * This article was sent in by Voitinsky for publication in the jour-nal Prosveshcheniye.
—Ed.
party in Russia do the local groups of party members open-ly discuss the party’s internal differences?? Eh?? The author adheres to a sort of sentimentally hysterical point of view.
The resolutions represent an all-important process of consolidation of the workers’ party, for no one in the world can make the workers choose between two hurrahs (that of the partyists and that of the liquida-tors) other than conscious sympathy and a sorting out of trends.
To allow the somewhat rude form of proletarian “brawl” to screen the tremendous ideological and organi-sational significance of the working class’s struggle over two trends, is phenomenal blindness.
I can think of no better explanation of this blindness than the fact that the author is completely out of touch and has “fallen under the spell” of the vile Menshevik gang.
The author has absolutely failed to understand the reference to the worker curia.
47%-50%-67% in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Dumas.
* Is that a fact or not?? What has the “reac-tionary nature of the curias” (about which the crooks and the Burenins shout from the columns of Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta, drawing a red herring across the path) got to do with it?? Did not the same reactionary law, meaning the same curia law, apply in all three cases? Even an infant would understand that the reactionary nature of the cu-rias has nothing to do with it.
The fact remains that the intelligentsia have cleared off (and good riddance to the whores) and the workers have found their own feet against the liquidators.
A new historical period.
A new epoch.
Yet the author invents a “middle line ” —it would be funny were it not so sad.
The author has not understood one-hundredth of the depth of the struggle against the liquidators.
The Party cannot be restored unless it is restored against the liquidators.
The workers have grasped this now themselves.
For a month, from 20.
X to 2.
XI—4,800 signatures (N.
B.
) for the six and 2,500 for the seven (including 1,000 Bund-ist signatures.
N.
B.
! N.
B.
!).
Is that a fact or not?? This is a fact, sir, and not intellectualist whining! It is not a party, if you please, since they have no “common” organ-* Consecutive growth in the number of Bolsheviks in the worker curias in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Dumas.
—Ed.
isation, no “congress”!!! Ha-ha!! Nor will there be any-thing in common with the liquidators and Bundists—it is time to understand this instead of contemplating the old that is gone and done with.
A congress is extremely diffi-cult to call (hence the wreckers of the Party refer things “to a congress”, sort of ad kalendas graecas!).
These sig-natures, as it happens, represent the new form of the old party.
Fancy not being able to understand this! The old national “federation of the worst type” has gone for good.
This is another thing the author does not understand.
The author has a wrong idea of equality between the 6 and 7 (he is wrong to talk about the 8, since the Party does not recognise the eighth as a Social-Democrat * ).
Why shouldn’t the Party grant equality to the near-Party group in the Duma?? ** The author has not understood the se-rious significance of the conception “near-Party people”.
Our journal is not a literary miscellany, but a militant organ.
There can be no question, therefore, of publishing the article.
I would be very glad, however, to see the au-thor’s retort to my criticism, as I would generally wel-come any exchange of opinions with old friends.
If I have come it too strong with this criticism and expressed myself sometimes none too politely, I beg his pardon.
I can assure him I had no intention of being offensive, but simply, for old friendship’s sake, unburdened myself and said what I thought with open-hearted candour.
How splendidly the campaign for the six against the seven is going! What a wonderful rallying and education of the workers against the liberal labour politicians! What an excellent example, the first in Russia, of the workers’ party actually deciding the fate of its own representation in the Duma! This is no longer a crowd “who have done a little reading”, but an organised force.
The conference decided—the six acted—the organised thousands approved by discussing and signing—that is called a party against that rag of a paper, the new edition of the old Tovarishch, * This refers to Y.
I.
Jagiello.
—Ed.
** This does not bind the Party in any way; and it can educate the near-Party people.
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta, which is fouling and poisoning the working-class movement with its intellectualist muck.
And how splendidly the workers’ Duma group has devel-oped its activities! Right away a step forward not only in name, but in all its work! What an excellent speech, that of Badayev’s, on the freedom of coalition, compared with the iteration of shoddy liberal ideas by Tulyakov! Au revoir, dear comrade.
Spit on the Mensheviks more often, study the facts of the present-day labour movement, weigh their significance, and your—begging your pardon— moping mood will pass; instead of searching for a “middle line”, you will help to rally the workers against the gang of traitors.
Yours, V.

Bruxelles), that the congress will be held there (or near there) “not later than within a week” (written 4 or 5.
I).
The task now is to try and rally the Bolsheviks.
You have committed a gigantic mistake in not making arrange-ments for correspondence (this can be safely done abroad) with your travelling Bolshevik.
Try immediately to recti-fy this mistake by sending a letter at once to this Bolshe-vik—in two envelopes, addressed to Popov, with the inner envelope inscribed in Lettish: personal, for so-and-so.
Popov will find him and hand over the letter personally.
In this letter you should (1) fully recommend Popov (I vouch for him) (and give (N.
B.
) Popov’s Brussels (N.
B.
) address) and (2) ask that the Lettish Bolshevik should im-mediately give you a detailed account of everything (di-rectly or through Popov), particularly of the make-up (1.
How many liquidators? 2.
How many Bolsheviks? 3.
How many Braunists, * etc.
, and of the plans of every group in detail).
I enclose a note for Popov, to whom you will write in Russian.
Give me the exact name of the pub, the street and house number and the exact hour of the rendezvous.
P.
S.
Am I to wire you or Herman or both of you? I have learned the timetable.
It will be most conveni-ent for me to leave here early in the morning.
I shall be in Berlin at 4.

Make an appointment at once for us to meet (I must meet both you and Herman), giving the hour (7-8-8 2 p.

I shall wire you the day of my departure and we shall meet at the pub.

Dear Comrade, As regards the arrangement for a rendezvous, you have done well.
But as regards the delegate, I scold you severely.
Appar-ently, he is either a fool or an old woman, who falls for the gossip and slander of the liquidator riffraff.
Popov has been sent a formal power of attorney from the C.
C.
, and he has spoken only to Sauer (an official of the Bureau Abroad!!).
Obviously, the liquidators are slandering Popov.
But that delegate of yours! A fine fellow indeed, if he believes the liquidators.
With warriors like these it would be ridiculous to start a war against the liquidators.
Such “warriors” only deserve to lick the boots of the liquidators all their lives.
And what made you, knowing how unreliable this dele-gate was, write to him that I needed the information??!The idea was that you ask him for the information.
Now that delegate will use your letter against me: that would be the limit! I am terribly angry.

seen Buryanov, who was on his way from Plekhanov.
Ap-parently, the Plekhanovites and other non-factionists in-tend to undertake some sort of joint “action”: I believe Plekhanov wants to publish a newspaper.
Trotsky and the local crowd are very shortly putting out a journal of their own, Borba.
They have effected a reconciliation with Luch; a correspondence was conducted on this subject.
The “pure” liquidators will remain in Nasha Zarya—that’s what that crowd “hopes” for.
That is what Bukharin writes.
This news is very impor-tant.
There’s no smoke without fire, and we are probably witnessing a new wave of idiotic conciliationist activity, which the I.
S.
B.
is sure to take advantage of to stage a comic act in the spirit of the 1910 January plenary ses-sion.
Well, we’re standing on our own legs now and we’ll show up this riffraff.
We must try our hardest (extremely tactfully, of course) to collect and keep collecting all the information we can in Paris.
That fool Antonov cannot collect gossip from Steklov, but Steklov can get money out of him.
And we haven’t a penny.
Kamenev and his family are living on nothing.
See to it, therefore, that the C.
O.
A.
does not give a single kopek away to anybody but us.
We shall shortly be in desperate need of money for putting out the C.
O.
, a special pamphlet and one very important publication (ab-solument entre nous: we will publish a special bulletin of the Central Committee 309 —for Russia we’ve got a special transport possibility * ).
The conciliators of all shades are out to “catch” us! Bon! We’ll catch those scoundrels, those ridiculous moun-tebanks.
They’re getting stuck in the mud of blocs with the liquidators? Bon! Our tactic is: if the enemy makes a false move, give him time to sink deeper into the mud.
That’s where we shall catch the scoundrels.
Meantime, we’ve got to gather strength and money—we’ve got to exercise restraint (to the utmost!)—to learn as much as we can.
Paris is a convenient centre for finding out things and for “diversions”.
It is most desirable that the section * The text in italics after the colon is written in English in the original.
—Ed.
adopt a sledge-hammer resolution against Kautsky (calling his statement about the death of the Party shameless, in-solent, monstrous, ignorant).
As for the few “near-concili-ators” of our section, let them get information from the Plekhanovites, the conciliators (Makar, Lyova, Lozovsky & Co.
) and the Trotskyites—as well as the Bundists and the Letts.

and vote it: if the majority turn it down, I’ll come and give that majority a leathering they’ll remember for a long time.

It is very important that he should hand them to you immediately—you may open them in order to wire their contents to me briefly: if it is not embarrassing, arrange this, because just these days (while Malinovsky is here) a delay of a day or two (= difference between a letter and a telegram) may be of extremely vital significance.
I think you could mention N.

The need is great since the ar-rest of Krylenko.

We are all delighted.
They take 2 poods a month.

But maybe it is simply an oversight? Will you please go to the forwarding office (on no account to the editorial office) and find out what it’s all about and let me know immediately.

KAMENEV Dear Friend, 1st.
* Bogdanov’s departure is said to have caused dis-pleasure (among the intellectualist riffraff, apparently).
That “good soul” of ours, Galyorka, is moping, I believe.
The Priboi people 313 voted for Bogdanov.
* Erroneously given as “2nd” in the typewritten copy.
—Ed.
They argue (an old trick of these intellectualist mischief-makers) that there are workers supporting Vperyod every-where (why weren’t they seen anywhere?.
.

).
That’s all bosh, of course.
The story of the Vperyod group’s adventurism will have to be given in Prosveshcheniye.
But now it is necessary that you should (1) take action.
The thing has to be explained, the stupid defenders of Vperyodism and Bogdanov (Dansky is one of them, apparently) must be challenged and warned.
(2) You must get your letter about An Introduction to Political Economy 314 published for cer-tain.
Write immediately.
If yours doesn’t go, I’ll send in mine.

2 Printed from a typewritten copy found in police records 330 TO CAMILLE HUYSMANS To Citizen Huysmans Cracow, March 7, 1914 Dear Huysmans, First of all, leaving aside the altogether objectionable tone of your letter, 318 I will state the facts in regard to my report.
On February , 1914 I left Brussels; as promised, my re-port had already been written.
A quarter of an hour before my departure I wrote you a letter (in the presence of Comrade Popov) at a café near the Northern Railway Station; in that letter I informed you that my report was already pre-pared (20 small pages and the resolution of the Lettish Con-gress * ) and that Comrade Popov had undertaken to trans-late it and deliver it to you.
** The address of the café was printed on the envelope of this letter, and if the letter has not been delivered to you I shall lodge a protest with the Brussels Post Office.
If you did receive this letter, I am greatly astonished that you do not mention it.
If Comrade Popov has not yet forwarded you a translation of my report, then I am completely at a loss.
I wrote to him several times, believing him to have fallen ill, since he has not written to me for several weeks now.
Today I am sending him another registered letter, Re-corded Delivery, in order to get to the bottom of this strange affair.
I am also writing to Comrade Karlson (256.
Rue Grau.
Bruxelles) asking him to call on Popov personally.
Secondly, the expressions you use in your letter (“tergi-versation”, “policy of procrastination”, etc.
) are insulting and you have no right to employ them towards a comrade.
I must ask you therefore to take back these expressions without reserve.
Unless you do so, this letter to you will be my last.

Didn’t Herman tell you that I fought tooth and nail? The conciliators won, however.
We must fight on now, but fight with sense.
The arrests don’t surprise me, since the Congress was ar-ranged by the liquidators with an outrageous lack of secrecy.
The whole of Brussels knew about it! The whole of Paris! This will be a lesson—beware of the liquidators! Show this letter to Herman.

I thank you very much for your communication.
* It is very important.
I believe that on the terms you mention, your participation was quite correct and useful for the cause.
Your request (to state in case of need that you played no game behind the backs of like-minded comrades) I shall gladly comply with, in the expectation, naturally, of receiv-ing detailed information from you.
I repeat, this is a very important matter, regarded as a symptom; your remarks concerning “the great interest of observing the process of a new stir-up” are perfectly correct.
It is vitally essential that we be informed about this process.
The only mistake on your part is, to my mind, the invi-tation of “a big man”, etc.
, “with strong leanings towards the Mensheviks and punctiliously correct”, etc.
“In case of need,” you write, “he will state how I bore myself at the meetings.
” I believe these gentlemen’s idea of correctness differs essentially from our own.
That’s one thing.
They are incapable of understanding what it means to betray the workers to the bourgeoisie.
Further, you will never need a defence by such a fellow.
The very assumption of the idea of such a defence is a confession (a needless confession) of the weakness and instability of your position, etc.
It perverts the purpose and meaning of your participation in the meetings.
A person capable of directly informing the centre of the organised force gathers information as to the attitude of mind of the vacillating elements and even of the enemies.
There’s nothing wrong in this at all.
But to invite (thus turning into a “force”!!) a trashy intellectual, who is incapable of distinguishing the bourgeoisie from its antipode, was a mistake.
It is this that will probably lead to idle talk, gossip and squabbles.
But this mistake is unimportant.
The business itself (your and our information) is far more important.
Please write more often and establish proper contacts for this purpose.
Answer as quickly as possible.
Couldn’t we get some money from the “type”?** It’s badly needed.
It’s not worth taking less than 10,000 rubles.

let me know how frankly you can talk: a) with the “type”, b) with his various friends, acquaintances, etc.

I think you should single out those one can talk with openly and openly put to them questions such as: aa) We are going to the limit of such-and-such methods of struggle; can we know what your limits are? Unofficially, privately!! bb) We are contribut-ing so-and-so in the way of forces, means and so on; can we know what your contribution to the struggle “outside the Duma” is likely to be? You say that the “type” considers that “the liberals changed front too early in 1905”—well then, get to know whether everybody thinks this and for what length of time approximately they intend to put off the change of front (this, of course, can be expressed not in terms of time, but in terms of political changes).
c c ) Are they capable of giving money? dd) ” ” ” ” creating an illegal organ? and so on.
Our aim is to inform ourselves and spur them on to give every possible active assistance to the revolution, with the question concerning the revolution being put as frankly and bluntly as possible (to a or to b or even to c as you know best).
If possible, it would be a good idea for you to deliver a report, on the theses of which I would gladly give my opinion, if need be.

The Germans virtually have parties, and this has to be borne in mind without trying to shield the opportunists (the way Neue Zeit and Kautsky are now doing).
But it is incorrect to say that the German party is the most opportunist party in Europe.
It is nonetheless the best party, and our task is to adopt from the Germans all that is most valuable (the mass of newspapers, the large party membership, the mass membership of the trade unions, the systematic subscription to the newspapers, strict con-trol over the parliamentarians—all the same the Germans are better at this control than the French and Italians, not to mention Britain—and so on), adopt all this without play-ing up to the opportunists.
We should not cover up the opportunists from Sozialisti-sche Monatshefte 324 (they have heaps of leaders there)—the way Neue Zeit and Kautsky and the German Vorstand are doing—but hound them with all our might.
This is what Grigory always does in his articles about the Germans.
I am now reading Legien (the trade union leader) on his visit to America and intend to pitch into that mean opportunist good and proper.

1914 Dear Friend, I still do not know whether you received my letters in which I wrote about the loss of the letter concerning Rakh-metov, and what you have done in this connection.
The package (containing the first part of the collection The Beginning 325 ) has been received by you, but very late.
If you still have the wrapper with the postmarks on it, I would advise you to lodge a complaint with the ministry, enclosing the wrapper.
The loss of the letter concerning Rakhmetov is simply exasperating, and I consider complaints, protests, etc.
, absolutely necessary.
I have a strong suspi-cion that the letters of the Russian emigrants are stolen in Paris (and taken by the police to be read before delivery to the addressees).
The dates on which letters are received should be kept track of.
I hope you have finished with Alexinsky? The only rem-edy in such cases (I speak from my own long, over 15 years, experience) is an absolute boycott by the entire section (but I suppose there are a lot of snivellers in it, who won’t apply a boycott and so will have themselves to blame for the “squabbles”).

* and not in 1912, but in 1911) we in the editorial office of Sotsial-Demokrat received Vinnichenko’s pamphlet in Russian devoted to a defence against the accusations levelled at him by the Social-Democrats, for “Honesty to Oneself”.
Vinnichenko asked for an answer in writing and in print.
I remember being impressed by the pamphlet, and I wanted to write about it, but was, prevented by all kinds of petty affairs (oh, those “petty affairs”, those apologies, for business, imitation products of business, a hindrance to business, how I hate fuss and bustle and petty affairs, and how tied I am to them inseparably and for all time!! That’s a sign more that I am lazy and tired and badly humoured.
Generally I like my profession and now I often almost hate it ** ).
By the way, I mislaid that pamphlet (published in Lvov) and have forgotten its title.
Find it if you can, read it and send it to me.
I thought Vinnichenko sincere and naïve when he puts the question: “Does a Social-Democrat have the right (!! sic!!) to visit a brothel?” and keeps harping on this question, but all the time individually.
He is sort of half-anarchist or total anarchist, and the Vperyodists must bamboozle him.
He once read a lecture in Paris on “Honesty to Oneself” with Lunacharsky in the chair, did he not? Or are things in such a way that Lunacharsky is for Vinnichenko, while Alexinsky is against? I would like to know some more details about it.

1914 Dear Friend,** The Malinovsky affair is warming up.

Is it true that there are conciliationist tendencies among prominent Pravdist workers, that one of them—by the name of Malinin or Dolinin—had a long talk about this with a contributor to the newspaper, the writer M.
N.
? It is very important to know whether this is a trend—if so, what sortof trend, what it stands for, what its terms of unity are—or just an individual and a casual fantasy.
As regards Plekhanov in his Yedinstvo, 333 you should adopt straightaway a tone to the effect that this distinguished theoretician, who has great services to his credit in the struggle against opportunism, Bernstein and the philosophers of anti-Marxism—a man whose mistakes in tactics during 1903-07 did not prevent him during the hard times of 1908-12 from singing the praises of the “underground” and exposing its enemies and opponents, that this man now, unfortunately, is again revealing his weak side.
The utter vagueness of his ideas is due, perhaps, partly to his being totally uninformed: it is not clear whom he wants unity with—with the Narod-niks (see Sovremennik, in which the Himmers are already parading his name) or with the liquidators of Nasha Zarya and Mr.
Potresov, and on what conditions? And, having put these questions, you should calmly state that the reader will hardly get a clear answer to these natural questions, since we know from the literature that it is these very questions Plekhanov is vague about.
Again my greetings and congratulations on your huge success (but the business side, the business!!!) and my best wishes.
Contributor to Put Pravdy The tone of the newspaper, pending the Vienna congress, should be altered.
We are in for a period of struggle.
We must pull no punches at the insolent beggars of the different little groups, we must nip in the bud their attempts at disorganisation.
They dare to split the four-fifths!! * Drop me a line whether you agree, and when you are issuing.
You should hit out at the liquidators and the little groups at once and as hard as possible: the 40,000 must know exactly where we stand.
It is our duty to make a laughingstock of the adventurists.

We shall work out the tactics in minute detail.

You are well up in the busi-ness, you speak French perfectly, and you read Pravda.
We also have in mind Popov, Kamsky and Yuri.
Letters have been sent to all of them.
So answer at once, without an hour’s delay.
Consent! Very truly, * V.

We haven’t decided yet about the delegation and haven’t formed it.
We are searching.
It’s all at the stage of prelim-inary talks so far.
But time is short.
We must make great haste!! Consent, do! It will make a good change for you and you will help the cause!! Grigory’s wife is ill.
I don’t want to go “on principle”.
Apparently the Germans (the resentful Kautsky & Co.

350 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, * I am terribly afraid that you will refuse to go to Brussels, and thus place us in an absolutely impossible position.
And so I have thought up another “compromise”, which you will simply be unable to refuse.
Nadya believes your elder children have arrived already, and you could easily leave them for 3 days (or take Andrei with you).
In the event of the elder children not having arrived and it being absolutely impossible for you to leave the children for 3 days, I suggest that you go for one day (the 16th, even for half a day, to read the report), either leaving the children for the day, or even sending for K—vich for that day at an extremity.
(We shall pay the expenses.
) You see, it’s extremely important that the main report, at least should be read really effectively.
And for that purpose excellent French is definitely needed, otherwise the effect will be nil—French, because otherwise nine-tenths will be lost in translation for the very Executive Committee for whom the effect is primarily intended (the Germans are hope-less, and they may not be there).
Besides excellent French, of course, an understanding of essentials and proper tact are needed.
You are the only suit-able person.
So please—I beg you most earnestly—consent, if only for one day (you will read the report and apologise, plead-ing illness in the family, and go away, handing things over to Popov).
If you have already refused by letter, wire (Ulja-now.
Poronin—10 words cost 60 heller): “agree one day”, “agree 16 only”, etc.
All the very best.

Grigory will hardly be able to go— Zina is still in hospital (a bad “phlegmon”) and his nerves have gone to pieces.
I am no good here.

How to determine the proportionate share of expenditure on the education of different nations? (if this share is required to be not lower than the share of the given nation in the population).
You should consider this.
Collect data.
Go through the literature.
Go into details.
Give examples in figures from the life of the Caucasus.
Yet not a word from you about this! * The italicised words marked with an asterisk are in English in the original.

To include autonomy in self-determination is wrong.
It is a downright error.
See my articles in Prosveshcheniye.
* You are vacillating and “searching” for something.
It’s wrong.
You should understand the Programme and stand for it.
Write me a criticism of my articles in Prosveshcheniye, and we’ll talk it over.
It is shameful to stand for an official language.
It is a police-regime idea.
But there is not a shadow of police-regime practice in advocating Russian for small nations.
Don’t you understand the difference between the truncheon and the advocacy of a free man? Amazing! “I exaggerate the danger of Great-Russian nationalism”!!! Now that’s really funny! Do the 160 millions in Russia suffer from Armenian or Polish nationalism? Is it not a shame for a Russian Marxist to adopt the point of view of an Armenian hen-coop? Is it Great-Russian nationalism that oppresses and shapes the policy of Russia’s ruling classes, or is it Ar-menian, Polish?? “Armenian” blindness makes you a Hand-langer of the Purishkeviches and their nationalism! To change the subject.
Collect immediately and send me exact information: 1) on the time and frequency of publica-tion in the Caucasus of Social-Democratic newspapers in Georgian, Armenian and other languages (from such-and-such a date to.

So many issues.
Liquidators’ and ours.
2) Circulation of each of them.
3) The number of workers’ groups which have made donations.

, Vol.
4 8 Printed from the original Written in English 358 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I am extremely grateful to you for giving your agree-ment.
I am positive you will carry off your important role with flying colours and give a fitting answer to Plekhanov, Rosa Luxemburg and Kautsky and Rubanovich (the in-solent fellow!) who are going to Brussels in the hope of stag-ing a demonstration against us generally and against my-self in particular.
You are sufficiently familiar with the business, you speak well, and I am sure you will now have enough “cheek”.
Please don’t take my desire to give you occasional advice in “a bad sense”.
It is meant to make your difficult task easier.
Plekhanov likes to “disconcert” comrades of the “female sex” with “sudden” gallantries (in French, and so on).
You must be prepared to meet this with quick re-partees—I am delighted, Comrade Plekhanov, you are quite an old spark (or a gallant cavalier)—or something like that to politely take him down a peg.
You should know that everybody will be very angry (I’m very glad!) at my notbeing present, and will probably want to take it out on you.
But I am sure you will show them your “nails” in the best possible way.
I am tickled in advance at the thought of the cold, calm and somewhat scornful snub they will be publicly inviting.
Plekhanov likes to heckle and bully his victim.
My advice is—cut him short immediately, saying: you have a right, as has every member of this conference, to ask questions, but I am not answering you personally, I am answering the whole conference, so will you please not interrupt me—and by this means promptly turn his heckling into an attack upon him.
You should be on the offensive all the time.
Or, say: I shall take the floor when my turn comes, in lieu of an answer and for an ans-wer (I prefer it that way), and you will be quite satisfied.
In my experience this is the best way to deal with insolent fellows.
They are cowards and will sing small at once.
They don’t like it when we quote resolutions.
But that is the best answer: I have come here chiefly to convey the officially documented decisions of our workers’ party.
For those who are interested in these decisions I shall tell about one of them.
Especially nota bene and look through beforehand: 1) The resolution of the 1912 January Conference on the constitution of the Conference.
* This is on the question of the validity of the January Conference of 1912 (Rosa Luxemburg will probably raise the question of validity and so will others).
(By the way, I am glad that .
.
.
the Germans will hardly understand you, if they understand at all—sit closer to the Executive Committee and speak for them.
At the same time you yourself have a full right to ask Huysmans after every German speech—the trans-lation, please!) 2) The resolutions of 1912 and 1913 on flexible forms ** (for Kautsky: this fool cannot grasp the difference between recognition of the underground and the search for new forms of screening this underground and organising it).
* See present edition, Vol.
17, pp.
453-54.
—Ed.
** Ibid.
, pp.
472-73 and Vol.
18, pp.
458-59.

3) The resolutions of II.
1913 on unity from below * (“You exclude 670 groups of workers??” Nonsense! We invite them.
“The majority has no right to exclude the minori-ty.
” Except in cases when the minority flouts the will of the majority and does not bow to formal decisions.
This is our case).
Yours, V.
U.
I advise you not to forget the official definition of the aim of the conference (take the French text of the reso-lution of the I.
S.
B.
of XII.
1913 from Popov or Huysmans), which is: To exchange opinions on moot points!! Just that! To exchange opinions—that is what you are doing.
Another important subject for popular elucidation (you have to be extremely popular with the French) is that of the illegal organisation, of the complete trust, secrecy, etc.
, which it calls for.
It is all very well for you Euro-peans: you have an open, legal party, you have lists of party members, you have open control and verification!! Every-thing’s easy then!! With us, however, an accurate and open recording of party membership in the illegal organisation is impossible, as is also open control.
Therefore, the maximum trust is needed in order to maintain discipline and good teamwork, whereas the liquidators, in rejecting the idea of an under-ground, are destroying the very possibility of joint work.
The opinion that it is impossible today in Russia to de-termine the strength of the trends, to say whose lead the majority follows, is erroneous, however.
Thanks to the newspaper, to the contributions from the workers’ groups, etc.
, this can be determined quite relia-bly and unmistakably.

In Grigory’s opinion we should not walk out because of a refusal to take minutes and publish them; but a writ-ten statement should be submitted.
The Executive Com-mittee is an intermediary.
This should be kept firmly in mind (this is stated in the official resolution of the Inter-national Socialist Bureau of XII.
1913).
Not an arbiter, but an intermediary.

We are an autonomous party.
Keep this firmly in mind.
No one has a right to impose anybody’s will upon us, and the International Socialist Bureau has no right either.
If there are threats, this is a mere phrase.

You handled the thing better than I could have done.
Language apart, I would probably have gone up in the air.
I would not have been able to stand the hypocrisy and would have called them scoundrels.

Huysmans had done all against you & our delegation, but you have dejoné ses his sallies * in the best manner.
You have rendered a very great service to our party! I am especially thankful because you have replaced me.
The telegram (yesterday) says “you (we) and the Letts” participated in the voting of an omnibus resolu-tion on tactics and organisation (there are no more tactical differences, etc.
).
I’m sure this is a slip of the pen.
You and the Letts did not participate (in the programme either).
The liquidators’ last card is the help of the foreign organ-isations, but that card, too, will be beaten.
* I’ve sent your son 150 frs.
Probably it is too small sum? Pray, let me know at once how much more you have spent.
I shall send it immediately.

Your divergence I cannot understand precisely & think it is not important.
Important was only the vote & you were right of participating in it.
That’s all.
Why it is “extremely unpleasant” for you to write about you being delegated from the delegation—I do not under-stand.
Your quarrel with Popoff is a bagatelle.
Why are you against being delegated??? Write frankly, please!! Thank you for details about conference! The comrade from the Lettish party is here.
We shall speak with him precisely about their participation in our congress.
It’d be very good if you commence an exchanging of letters with Kautsky (he is a mean creature, totally without character, under private influences, always changing po-sition according secret influence and angry against me be-cause of “money story”: it is especially mean to act as “impartial” or to play the role of “impartial”, being par-tial & angry especially against me personally because of private quarrel with me because of money.

If he begged you to write him & if you can undertake the work of translating in French all report and to sending him it (especially about 4.

But, naturally, it is a very hard work & what concerns me I do not ask you to make it.

RUDIS-GIPSLIS 346 Dear Comrade Rudis, I recently met a highly respected and valuable Lettish Social-Democrat, * who told me about the “Left opposi-tion” in the Lettish party.
He said you belonged to it.
I do not know to what extent the opposition which you and your friends are raising to the Lettish C.
C.
is a really “Left opposition”.
I am sure, at any rate, that if you are doing so, you are acting in good faith.
In any case, the leftward shift on the part of the Lettish C.
C.
is an obvious fact.
Proof of this is provided by the resolution in No.
32 of Trudovaya Pravda and the refusal to vote in Brussels for the tainted, absurd resolution cov-ering up the liquidators.
The Polish opposition voted for; in my opinion this is either treachery or a dirty “game” or diplomacy of the worst kind.
The 4th District in Riga is said to stand for closer rela-tions with our C.
C.
? Is that true? Are the majority of Lettish workers for it or not? I think it would be important to acquaint the Lettish workers with our “14 conditions”.
I sent them to Herman I don’t think he would refuse to let you have them for a short time to read.
* A reference to E.
Zvirbulis.
—Ed.
Further, it would be important to make clear our atti-tude in principle towards federation.
We are against it in principle.
We are for democratic centralism.
In that case, why preserve the old rotten “agreement” of 1906 with the Lettish Social-Democrats, which retains the federative clauses, such as that providing for a delegation from the Lettish C.
C.
to the general C.
C.
?? Even the Poles in Stockholm (1906) rejected this federalist clause in principle.
I do not believe that the class-conscious Lettish work-ers stand for this clause—it facilitates manoeuvring, diplomacy, clannishness.
It is harmful to the work.
Further.
Is it true that there is vacillation among the class-conscious Lettish workers on the question of the need for combating the separatism of the Bund and cultural-national autonomy?? It would be very deplorable! Has the resolution of our summer (1913) meeting OD the national question been translated into Lettish and pub-lished? 347 The Polish opposition in Brussels adopted the liquida-tors’ stand and “Tyszka’s” play at diplomacy: a backheel for the Pravdists, a blow at them from behind, and sepa-ration from them “in the face of Europe”.
They now want, in the Tyszka way, to uphold the federalist clauses in agreements and “cover up” the nationalism of the Bund (cultural-national autonomy), defend the rotten (for the liquidators useful) “lawfulness” of the Party up to 1912 (i.
e.
, prior to the Party’s re-establishment against the li-quidators).
I hope the Letts will not follow this path.
I would like to know your opinion and that of your Riga friends, of the 4th District and others.
All the best.

370 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, Hugeous regards from all of us to Abram.
Let him visit friends in Lausanne.
He will find interesting documents there* and I will address a demand to you to translate these documents in French & send to Sentinelle (and to me send also with an occasion).
350 (What party? Where published? Is it a decent organ? Please send me one copy of the most characteristic issues of this paper.
) I am extremely anxious & angry with the position of the European socialists in the present war.
My conviction is that all—& the German socialists first of all & chief of all—got “chauvinists”.
It is quite insupportable to read German and French (l’Humanité!!) socialist papers!! Ex-treme “chauvinism”! I am afraid that many, too many socialists, have lost their head (if I dare say so) in the pres-ent crisis, and that in the last end it is the opportunism which is responsible for this extreme “infamie” of the Eu-ropean socialism.
I am told Martynov (liquid.
) in Zurich has had a conference (private, I suppose) and firstly at-tacked German socialists—but later on (the second day of discussion) a changé d’avis (sous l’influence funeste d’Axel-rod) et a denie tout ce qu’il avait dit plus abord!!!** Shame!!

Dear Friend, Yesterday evening we read about the arrest of 11 people (including 5 members of the R.
S.
D.
L.
Duma group) 351 near St.
Petersburg and today we sent a telegram to Branting for you to find out (le cas échéant through the Finns) wheth-er the 5 members of the Duma group have been arrested or not.
It’s a bad job if they have! All the more inadmissible is your departure for Oen-mark.
Generally, I strongly protest against such a remov-al.
Now of all times you have to be in Stockholm in order to organise contacts more properly, frequently and widely.
This is a difficult job that requires an experienced man, knowing at least one foreign language.
It simply cannot be shuffled off onto “somebody”.
If you are molested (by the police) in Stockholm, you should hide yourself in a village outside Stockholm (this is easy, they have telephones everywhere).

SHLYAPNIKOV 3/I.
1915 Dear Friend, I received your two letters with the news of your depar-ture.
The arguments you have advanced against my supposi-tion (about the possibility of your not going to Copenha-gen, not leaving Stockholm) have fully convinced me.
I see that I have overlooked a really very important circumstance.
If I have offended you, I am prepared to tender my voluble apologies and earnestly ask you to forget it.
The village * is really far more dangerous now (and in-convenient for the work) than the town.
Generally speaking, the situation now is such that the fight against tsarism calls for the utmost care—especially as regards the preservation of reserves.
To expend still more forces (soon after our immeasurable losses) would mean weakening ourselves completely for the moment of more decisive actions against tsarism.
Therefore I ask you most earnestly to double and triple secrecy precautions and 1) either not go beyond asking for somebody to be sent to Sweden, 2) or confine yourself to the briefest of visits.
I would ask you earnestly to confine yourself to the former and not make the latter (if there is the slightest possibility of not doing so).
* Meaning Sweden.
—Ed.
It would be better not to go to the conference (16/I) of the Scandinavians.
Grigory and I have just discussed this for the umpteenth time.
The Swiss are not going.
That means there is an obvious intrigue of the Germans and Troelstra&Branting.
They will try their hardest to muddle things up and will not allow you to make your Swedish speech.
Unless there is an absolute guarantee that you will be allowed to make such a speech, you had better not go altogether.
We should send (through Litvinov) α) a complete translation of our manifesto, β) a translation of the govern-ment’s report concerning the arrest of the R.

group in the Duma—and all this to be sent not as a rapport, not as an account (so that it should not appear as if we recog-nise the conference), but as a communication.

Gorter Dear Comrade Gorter, Comrade Radek has shown me your letter.
It would certainly be very good if an international Social-Democratic journal could be founded under the editor-ship of Pannekoek.
We must fight Neue Zeit’s mean way of defending opportunism of the worst brand by means of sophisms.
The only question is—will we have enough money and literary forces to establish the journal immediately? If not, we must without fail issue one (or two) pam-phlets in German, without waiting until the war is over.
The pamphlet should consist of articles by Russian, Dutch, German (Radek), French (perhaps Merrheim) and English (perhaps Rothstein) comrades, who consider it necessary to wage a ruthless fight against the opportunist traitors (in-cluding Kautsky).
In my opinion, we should under no circumstances lose any time in doing this.
It is necessary, right now, while the war is still on, to tell the whole truth—naturally, not in Germany, but in Switzerland, so that we can speak freely about the revolutionary struggle, without a censorship.
If a French or English contributor cannot be found at once, we should not wait; better issue the first pamphlet ourselves (i.
e.
, without the French and English).
We can make do with a translation of Merrheim’s opinion (namely, that to speak about a “war of liberation” is a deception).
Radek says that your pamphlet has come out in English.
I am very glad to hear it—I shall now be able to read and understand it.
I understand Dutch to the extent of approx-imately 30-40%.
I congratulate you on your splendid at-tacks on opportunism and Kautsky.
Trotsky’s principal mistake is that he does not attack this gang.

Wijnkoop Translated from the German 400 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, * I have written to you once or twice, but truth to tell, there is little news here.
The news from Russia is not bad, you will read it all yourself soon, I hope, when you come here.
You don’t mention a word about what length of time your dentist has appointed for your treatment.
Even approximately? You should travel either by post-chaise (up to Flühli twice a day, at 9 a.
m.
and 4 p.
m.
from Schüpf-heim, and to us, to Sörenberg, only once a day, at 9 a.
m.
from Schüpfheim).
To catch the morning post (that is, the post-chaise), I think you must start out from Berne at 5.
30 a.
m.
and wait 1 2 hours at Schüpfheim.
But if you leave Berne at 2.
05, as we did, the post-chaise will take you only as far as Flühli; from there you will have to hire a horse-drawn vehicle (for that purpose you will have to telephone from Schüpfheim—there is a restaurant there op-posite the station.
The keeper for 10 pfg.
will telephone us here, Hotel Marienthal in Sörenberg, saying you are coming and asking for a horse-drawn carriage to be sent: in that case they will just manage to get to Flühli from here and bring you down here from Flühli).
The fare by post-chaise is fr.

Horse and carriage here costs 4 frs.

for 2 people) from Flühli to Sörenberg.

I wrote Grigory yesterday about inviting Grimm to Kommunist.
Today I read Trotsky’s answer (to Kom-munist) in Nashe Slovo.

Tell Grigory this.
Another request: when you see Kasparov, ask him to obtain the official address of the Bureau (in Geneva? or in Berne?), which undertakes to forward money to Russian prisoners of war in Germany (letters as well as money, but chiefly money).
It is very important to have the official address, so that I can apply to them and be sure the money will not get lost.
Another request (tut-tut! Our tons of things and requests will crush you completely, eh?): buy citric acid in crystals (Zitronensäure).
It’s a bad job—going out into the coun-try after everybody else!! There is still no reply from Neuchâtel.
366 Would you believe it! Au revoir, Yours, Lenin When opportunity offers, ask Radek before your departure whether he would like to come.
If he does, we shall invite him.

ZINOVIEV Dear Friend, I am greatly surprised that you—for no apparent reason —have shirked a meeting! There was no need to make peace, as the visitors were remarkably peaceable (only one of them wanted Kamenev expelled from the Party).
We came to an agreement splen-didly (without posts).
370 The translation of Radek is not very good (Part I is dull) (it is needed, though, for the sake of solidity).
I have for-warded it to N.
I.
371 Before I forget.
The visitors have persuaded me that it is not worth airing in the press our differences in the Edi-torial Board of Kommunist (about you and me having voted against Trotsky).
They are right.
Delete it!! As to Chkheidze’s group, 3 7 2 we must start a campaign against it.
Therefore (since the passage regarding the vot-ing is to be deleted), I raise again the question of insert-ing my small article “An Instructive Experience” (the talk with the visitors has shown once again that the whole crux now is in the Chkheidze group).

Should we propose amendments to Radek right away? (&an all-out struggle against the opportunists;&civil war; &a split with the opportunists).

I don’t think there will now be a conference of Left-ists: Kautsky & Co.

Radek is silent.
I do not agree with the end of your article (about Nashe Slovo).
“Peace” as presented by Nashe Slovo should be attacked a hundred times more sharply.
We should not make excuses (“that is not the point”, “we admit”) but attack: the Nashe Slovo people are engaging in phrase-mongering about “peace”, while seeking peace with the social-chauvinists.
The gist of their peace slogan is peace with the social-chauvinists.
It should be pointed out (and elaborated) that peace without terms is nonsense, a mere phrase.
Then it should be elaborated that peace for the ignorant mass has a different meaning (à la “Gaponade” 380), but as a slogan of the Party it is charlatanry.
We are for participation in the Gapon unions, but against the “Gapon” slogans.
I advise discussing this further by letter.
Yours, Lenin I am sending you Fridolin’s letter.
I advise inviting him; let me know whether you write to him, or want me to write.
((Return all the letters of Radek, Fridolin, etc.
)) I am not sure that you communicated all your latest literary “titles” to me.
Eh?? I think we ought to obtain Alexinsky’s book La Russie et la guerre.
What do you think? I believe the “Bibliography and Notes” in Kommunist were better unsigned (for the sake of variety and avoiding repitition of the same names).
Vote this proposal.
Yuri, if he likes, may leave his sig-nature (“Pyotr Kievsky”): I suggest that his article 381 be given in the same section.

1915 Dear Comrade, I am sending you the report on the Berne preliminary conference by our representative Comrade Zinoviev.
Will you please show it to Comrades Pannekoek and Gorter and let us know as soon as possible your opinion and that of your party (or resolution).
I think this preliminary conference was very important and useful only in the sense that it definitely showed up the “strange” (to put it mildly) role of certain German “Leftists” (Frau Clara Zetkin in particular).
A few months ago I asked one of the German “Leftists” in the presence of Comrade Radek whether, if things came to a split, Clara Zetkin would go with the old or with the new party (that is, the revolutionary, and not the national-liberal party like that of today).
“With the old one,” this “Leftist” an-swered without hesitation.
Comrade Radek got very angry with this Leftist and assured me that the man was mistaken, and that Clara Zetkin would decidedly and sincerely fight the mean German social-chauvinists.
And now this argument has definitely been settled, but not in favour of Radek.
Zetkin wishes to go together with Haase-Kautsky, but Haase-Kautsky desire “unity” (with Südekum: we call this in Russian “unity of lackeys, a splitting of revolutionaries”, that is, unity with the na-tional bourgeoisie, a splitting of the international working class)!! I am convinced that this “Left” conference with Zetkin, with Haase, without Lichtstrahlen and the Tri-bune people, is sheer hypocrisy: the objective significance of this conference consists merely in strengthening the old disreputable party by means of a sham struggle of the “Left” (à la Zetkin) against the “Right” (the Whigs and Tories of present-day Britain!).
We must (together with the Tribunists and some of the German Leftists, not à la Zetkin—perhaps also with the Lettish party and the Polish Social-Democrats (known asthe Opposition)) do something very quickly, if we do not want to miss this very important moment.
Comrade Radek promised to translate our resolutions into German.
* You are already familiar with our Manifesto (of the Central Committee)—it has been published, un-fortunately in abbreviated form, in your Tribune.
David in his book quotes this Manifesto very conscientiously (al-most unbelievably so for an opportunist).
We are send-ing you Radek’s translation and would ask you to let us know as soon as you can whether you consider it possible and advisable to prepare a joint resolution and come for-ward with a joint declaration of protest against the “Left” conference (Zetkin & Co.
).
We, I believe, shall do it—in one form or another.

Democratic “Opposition”, and probably also the Lettish Social-Democrats).
I don’t think it matters much—theses or resolutions.
What matters is that we clearly and popu-larly formulate the revolutionary tactics, define the imperial-ist nature of the war and defend Marxism against falsifica-tion by Kautsky, Plekhanov & Co.
Unfortunately, Radek has not yet sent me his draft dec-laration.
I hope that you, on reading our resolutions, will answer me in the shortest possible time whether you agree with us in principle.
Everything should be ready by Au-gust 7-10.
If you can say quite definitely whether any one of your people could be in Berne between August 7 and 10, then perhaps it would be possible to arrange a small conference in Berne and jointly draw up the theses.
If not, we shall have to arrange it by correspondence, and this will take a long time.

And then in three other languages.
I think two purposes can be served: 1) A Vademecum for Russian Social-Democrats, agitators and “leading workers”.
A clear, popular, precise summary of all arguments.
A clear summing-up: correctness of the expulsion of Nasha Zarya, the struggle against it and against the Organising Committee&Chkheidze [Vademecum for elections to the Duma].
2) A precise statement for the people abroad: a political step for welding the III International more serious than a dozen talks and meetings with a dozen Grimms, Zetkins and suchlike Klatsch-Weiber *** in trousers and skirts.
Answer without delay.
If you agree, we shall discuss the plan in still greater detail, and then divide the sub-jects.
3) The O.

riffraff will be induced to come forward with a platform of “their own”, but they have nothing of their own! Could you send me cuttings of Hamburger Echo gems? A gem in Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung: a letter from Russia that Axelrod is making concessions to the “opportunists”.

421 TO DAVID WIJNKOOP 30/VII.
1915 Dear Comrade, I received your letter and postcard.
I am sending you the complete French translation of our Manifesto; I have already sent you the translation of our Party’s resolutions, made by Radek.
You now have all the documents (as regards the “United States of Europe”, I think we shall adopt Gorter’s point of view).
I am very glad that we agree in essentials.
What we need is not the solemn declarations of leaders (against which Pannekoek has written so well), but a consistent revolutionary declaration of principles to help the workers find the correct path.
This is most essential.
I was par-ticularly pleased to hear that you are in touch with the Bel-gian friends (we could send P.
Golay’s pamphlet for them, if you haven’t already seen it 389 ) and wish to talk person-ally with some of the Leftists in another country.
If the Belgian anonymous group “Étoile” and another, German, group published a declaration of principles together with your and our party—this would be a good and serious be-ginning.
The Swedish Left with Höglund are on our side: I received a letter today about this.
It would be a good thing if you wrote to England and persuaded some group there (if only a small one) to draft a joint declaration.
Sincere regards and wishing you success.
Yours, N.

I have a right to demand and will demand from them statements in writing and secretaries’ minutes of general decisions (so that we can catch the cheats, who want to break away and throw the blame onto us!).
Are they leaving? When? Or not? Two fools engaged in counting money could have figured out in 3 months how much 100 rubles is worth in frs.

IX.
You, too, probably are already familiar with Radek’s draft.
This draft seems to me rather academic (this objection, of course, is unimportant) and—what is far more important—unsatisfactory in regard to the most important point, which is driven home so well, for in-stance, in Gorter’s pamphlet, namely: a decisive struggle against opportunism.
If we are silent about this before the workers, we shall be hushing up a circumstance without which nothing real can be created.
Will you please let me know your opinion and the opinion of your Central Committee.
Also, whether a representative of your party is coming for certain (and if not, would you give Radek a mandate or send a declaration, etc.
).
If pos-sible, write to England, to the minority of the British So-cialist Party; let this minority send either a representative, or at least a declaration.
If, as a result of this conference, we receive not only diplomatic conjuring tricks of the leaders (so well ridiculed by Pannekoek), but also a Left Marxist international declaration of principles, it will be a very useful thing.
The group of Belgian internationalists, of whom you know, should also send a declaration or give you a mandate (sections of parties will certainly be admitted too).
An anti-chauvinist opposition to Vandervelde—however small— would be extremely important.
It is the first step that counts! Awaiting your reply, With S.

440 TO ALEXANDROVICH 19/IX.
1915 Dear Comrade, Comrade Kollontai has forwarded your letter on to me.
I have read and reread it attentively.
I can understand your passionate protest against the emigrant colony, which apparently did anything but please you.
The experience of 1905, however, has proved, in my opinion, that there are emigrants and emigrants.
Part of the emigrant body, which prior to 1905 had devised the slogans and tactics of revo-lutionary Social-Democracy, proved in the years 1905-07 to be closely linked with the mass revolutionary movement of the working class in all its forms.
The same applies today, in my opinion.
If the slogans are correct, if the tactics are the right ones, the mass of the working class, at a given stage of development of its revolutionary movement, is bound to come round to these slogans.
You write that for the people “Plekhanov is merely a name”.
I cannot agree with this, although, perhaps, the difference between us here is only a seeming one.
Plekhanov is the most strik-ing, and in Russia, thanks to the bourgeois and liquidator press, the most popular exponent of the extremely wide-spread “people’s” patriotism.
In showing up Plekhanov we are, in fact, answering a host of questions, thoughts, doubts, and so on, that arise in the minds of the people.
But, of course, it is up to an intelligent propagandist and agitator to translate the dispute of a revolutionary inter-nationalist Marxist with Plekhanov into another language, to approach the matter in a different way, to make allow-ance for the specific qualities of the environment, etc.
, etc.
For that matter, you probably take the same view your-self, since you distinguish only the “Left trends” (the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats) and our dispute with Plekhanov & Co.
is precisely that of determin-ing and separating trends.
As to the urgency of the problem of sending people to Russia you are quite right.
We do what we can in this field lately.
The other day I received another letter from a Social-ist-Revolutionary, who writes that after the conference of the Trudoviks&Popular Socialists&Socialist-Revolution-aries in Russia (a chauvinist conference) 403 he gives the Socialist-Revolutionary Party up as a bad job.
I, too, doubt whether it has any viable elements in it.
At any rate, I consider it a fact that there are now 2 main revolutionary trends in Russia: the revolutionary chauvinists (to over-throw the tsar in order to defeat Germany) and the revolu-tionary proletarian internationalists (to overthrow the tsar as a means of assisting the international revolution of the proletariat).
Any rapprochement between these trends be-yond occasional “joint actions” is, in my opinion, impos-sible and harmful.
The war has linked together the prole-tariat of all the great powers of Europe, the war has placed on the order of the day the task of putting into effect prole-tarian solidarity.
A difficult task, to be sure, but one that is posed by life itself and cannot be shelved.
If you are going to work in Russia and should you wish to help the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Left Social-Democrats, I would advise giving help to each of them separately, helping to link * the respective groups, both in different places among themselves, and with the centres abroad.
The Social-Democrats separately, the So-cialist-Revolutionaries separately.
This will yield definite benefit and make for less squabbling.
Rapprochement, when possible, will proceed more normally.
There will be greater trust.
I wish you every success and all the best.

You proved to be entirely right! I don’t think it’s worth having Gezänk * with Radek over the “pighead”, etc.

** She and Siefeldt have already found several Italian addresses; she has found an Italian to go through the translation.

I think the first thing to do now is to have it translated into Italian and given to an Italian to be vetted.
And then (avoiding Balabanova, who appar-ently won’t be of any help and is even capable of being an obstacle) it is necessary to start looking out for some newspaper or a league of Italians in Switzerland who would agree to publish it at their own expense: I don’t think this is a utopia, as the publication of 2,000 copies will cost 80 frs.

Does Platten attend the meetings of the party’s Execu-tive? Does he have the minutes? Has he a vote or not? Does he agree to develop the decision on “revolutionäre Aktionen” to keep it from being a dead letter? (In that case we should arrange publications, pamphlets, supplements to Swiss pa-pers concretising the idea of “revolutionäre Aktionen”, and smuggle all this into Germany.

ZINOVIEV I think we ought to go to Grimm and ask him to mark off exactly (with a red pencil) what passages he “wants delet-ed”! 411 Polemic? What about Trotsky and Vie Ouvrière? 412 Is the reference to Longuet-Pressemane less polemicalthan the reference to Chkheidze? Begründung? The same can be found in Trotsky and Vie Ouvrière.
I have my doubts whether it’s any use having talks with Grimm.
If he confined himself to quite minor amendments, I would be for making concessions.
But that is improbable.
In that case there are two alternatives: either we give up the idea of publishing it in the Bulletin and issue a leaflet.
Or we publish it in the Bulletin the way Grimm wants it, and in addition issue it complete as a leaflet marked: “Published without censorship”.
At any rate the main thing now is to get Grimm’s pencil marks of what he wants deleted.
That’s the main thing.
Go about this tactfully—speak him fair.
I shall answer the rest this evening or tomorrow.

I’m rather surprised that there is no news from you.
Let me confess, while I’m at it, that the thought occurred to me for a moment that you might have “taken offence” at my not having gone to see you off the day you left.

1916 Dear Friend, This is my third postcard to you.
This time in French, to make the work easier for the censors, if they are the cause of this delay with the mail.
As a matter of fact I have been worrying for several days now at the absence of any news from you! If you were offended with me, you would prob-ably have written to other friends, but as far as I know you have not written to anybody.
If I don’t get a letter from you within the next few days I shall write to our friends to find out whether you are ill.
I have inquired se-veral times about poste restante mail, but there is nothing.
The conflict with our young Polish friend has been settled satisfactorily; it was just a slight “misunderstanding” (that is his statement of the case).
Now everything is going well;the journal is already being made up; it should be issued in January.
* We have written to “your” editor in one of the towns of Romansh Switzerland.
** He simply doesn’t answer Strange, is it not? We are all looking forward to your mak-ing arrangements about novels and short stories in Paris where you will probably find lots of people, writers, pub-lishers and so on, since you are working in the National Library and are well acquainted with these people.
The weather is fine.
Last Sunday we went for a lovely walk up “our” little mountain.
The view of the Alps was very beautiful; I was so sorry you were not there with us.
Recently Camille Huysmans delivered a very long “dip-lomatic” speech at the congress of the Dutch party.
414 I don’t know whether you will be able to find the text of it in the French newspapers.
If you don’t, you will find it here.
He touched, “in passing”, on the September confer-ence and protested strongly against the “attempts at ex-propriation” (he doesn’t want to be “expropriated”, this secretary!) and so on and so forth.
A big diplomatist, a politician!.

What unworthy means! How are you getting on? Are you content? Don’t you feel lonely? Are you very busy? You are causing me great anxiety by not giving any news about yourself! .

451 TO INESSA ARMAND Friday Dear Friend, Only today did we receive your long letter; which was most welcome.
This is my fourth letter to you: all the first three postcards were poste restante.
If you haven’t received them, then they either go astray or else there are special rules (or misrules) in regard to poste restante mail.
Trotsky has written to our young Polish friend that he is not going to write for the Dutch journal * himself and cannot advise his friends of the nation among whom he is living to do so.
It looks like there is no avoiding a fight with Trotsky even on this question!! We received a postcard today from your brother.
** It is good to know that he has received something (either a letter or a No.
of our newspaper for the end of March) and writes about “sympathy”.
There is more sympathy, he says, in his part of the world than he expected.
By the way, I nearly forgot (I am in a great hurry to get this off by the next train).
If there are special misrules regarding poste restante mail, maybe that is the reason why I do not receive any letters (I have not had a single one from you), though you do write? Let me know at once: if you underline the date twice, it will mean that you do receive my letters and write to me.
Write to the same ad-dress at which we received your long letter.

Will you please 1) find out (tactfully—all this is secret) about this in detail: the date, place, duration, composi-tion; 2) ascertain whether a representative of our Party can attend; try to make this possible and get in yourself; 3) make a special attempt to find out, as quickly as you can, who exactly is going to be there from Scandinavia, get in touch with them, see them, and put them in touch with us as soon as possible.

Nevertheless your sympathies, I have no doubt about it, are with France.
The split among the German socialists, as one French minister expressed it, is not a matter of indifference to France.
Therefore we must help inform the Russians as well as the French about this.

But it should definitely be added: not “only” Otto Rühle, but also the group of International Socialists of Germany (l’Humanité, too, wrote about it).
Please insert this when next writing to Petrograd.
And also the following: only Otto Rühle and the International Socialists of Germany declared plainly for a split and against the “marsh”; as to the Internationale group (the German group of whom also Homo wrote in l’Humanité: a beauty of a newspaper!)—this group is * This refers to the Secretariat Abroad of the Mensheviks’ O.

It is very important to find out whether Chkheidze spoke about Zimmerwald in the Duma.

Try, through Radek, to trace Chkheidze’s speech in the Social-Democratic press of Ger-many as fully as possible (Martov & Co.
speculate on what Chkheidze said or is going to say for Zimmerwald).
I am drawing up the theses for our “Antrag” for 23/IV on the “peace programme”.
Should we enlist Radek’s co-operation for this job? I don’t think we should.
Radek is behaving so meanly! I still * haven’t got many copies of the theses, and I find it repugnant to write to Radek, seeing that he is out for squab-bles.
Why didn’t you answer whether you sent my insertion to the theses to be set up? You could have handed it in to the printing shop yourself and get the proofs from there (and order many copies: oh, to hell with him, that Dreckseele von Radek!).
We have the right, as authors, to order the proofs of the theses.

1916 Dear Comrade, Excuse me for not having answered your letter earlier.
I have been lecturing in various towns of Switzerland.
I thank you very much for your friendly reply.
I shall be very pleased if our collaboration proceeds without any friction.
Frankly speaking, there was never any question about you and Comrade Pannekoek being “decent people”, as you term it.
What worried us was the sudden change in the editorial regulations.
Under the first draft we were given editorial rights (Editorial Board= a union between your group (you& Trotsky) and the “Zimmerwald Left”; and in the bureau of this Left, as you know, we had two votes out of the three: Radek’s, Zinoviev’s and my own).
With the change in the draft we lost our editorial rights and became mere contributors.
Of course, we could not chal-lenge your right to draw up the regulations.
But it is only natural—is it not?—that we, as contributors, should nevertheless wish to have certain guarantees of our rights.
I trust the matter is now clear and definitely settled.
Immediately on receipt of your letter I gave orders to the forwarding office to send you our organ (Sotsial-Demo-krat—non-periodical; Nos.
33-51 were issued since the be-ginning of the war).
Are you receiving it? I take this opportunity to discuss important questions relating to our collaboration.
(1) Our theses (on the right to self-determination) * were sent to you by Radek (please forward them on to Gorter too; I am writing to him about this in detail in connection with his pamphlet).
I consider the Dutch-Polish standpoint to be altogether erroneous theoretically and a result of the policy of the small states practically.
Cannot our joint struggle against old and new annexations (what are annex-ations?) draw us somewhat closer together? The German, English and Russian standpoint is after all more important (and objectively more correct) than the Dutch and Polish! Gorter demands “national independence” for the Dutch East Indies.
Very good! But this is precisely the right to self-determination!! If Kautsky and the Russian Kaut-skyites (including Trotsky) present the question wrongly, this is only another argument against the Kautskyites! (If you are interested in this question, ask Gorter to send you my letter.
I shall be very pleased to discuss this ques-tion more fully with the Dutch Marxists.
) (2) The German group Die Internationale.
Have you read their theses in No.
3 of Grimm’s Bulletin? 427 In my opinion this is a decisive step to the right after the first issue of the journal Die Internationale.
Not a word against the Kautskian Centre—and that is the main thing for the German party.
Not a word about the split (Otto Rühle is quite right—and they keep silent about this after his article!!).
Not a word about obvious methods of struggle—about the illegal organisation, etc.
And the phrase: “in the era of imperialism there can no longer be national wars”! This is theoretically false.
Colonial wars are national wars.
(India against Britain, etc.
) This—practically—is chauvinism: we representatives of the Great Powers forbid the oppressed peoples to wage national wars!! My conclusion is this: Die Internationale wishes to come to an agreement with the Kautskyites.
These theses cannot be interpreted in any other way.
On top of it all, Ströbel in Neue Zeit lauds Bernstein! 428 Zetkin in Gleichheit * See V.
I.
Lenin, “The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination” (present edition Vol.
22, pp.
143-56).
—Ed.
is against the Zimmerwald Left: diplomatic phrase against “Bolshevik sectarianism” (!!).
A phrase worded so diplo-matically that no one can understand where our “sectarian-ism” comes in!! Zetkin stands for “aurea mediocritas” be-tween Ledebour and the Zimmerwald Left.
But how this is to be achieved—of this not a word.
What is our mistake? —so far, not a word about it, not a single line in Switzer-land, where there is no censorship.
How else can you account for it, other than as a desire to come to an agreement with Kautsky & Co.
? (3) The “draft” (Bulletin No.
3) drawn up by you and the S.
D.
P.
strikes me as being a very bad one.
429 Not even Radek could defend this draft.
Why this curtailment of the Party’s Programme? The programme of socialist revolution? Today there is no need for it—and such a programme lacks a point dealing with the conquest of political power.
In such a programme § 6 (A) and § 5 (B) are very odd; § 6 (B), too, sounds queer: it is precisely in the event of a social-ist revolution that we shall have need of a militia to defend the new order.
We are not pacifists, are we? We cannot count on a victory simultaneously all over the world (without civil wars? without wars?)! The colonial pro-gramme is absent altogether.
Only in the event of our being quite sure that we are right on the threshold of such a revolution shall we need such a programme—but even then it would have to be for-mulated quite differently.
Today, however, we need something quite different: the labour movement needs clear views on the necessity of breaking with the social-chauvinists and Kautskyites, on the illegal organisation, on the means and methods of mass struggle, etc.
(4) We shall soon send you our theses to points 5-8 of the agenda of the second conference.
* It would be a very good thing if we could come to an agreement—on some of the points, if not on all of them.

In brief—he is a Kautskyite, that is, he stands for unity with the Kautskyites in the Inter-national and with Chkheidze’s parliamentary group in Rus-sia.
We are absolutely against such unity.
Chkheidze with his phrases (that he is for Zimmerwald: see his recent speech, Vorwärts 5/III) cloaks the fact that he shares the views of the Organising Committee and of the people taking part in the war committees.
* Trotsky at present is against the Organising Committee (Axelrod and Martov) but for unity with the Chkheidze Duma group!! We are decidedly against.

I still have no copies (of the German theses on self-determination).
When is this going to end??? If Radek is holding up No.
2 of Vorbote, this is foul play on his part.
We must think over ways of combating this.
Should we not send a collective letter to Roland-Holst? Why not? Why should we stand on ceremony with him? This is a broken promise, we’ll say, it’s bad for the business, it’s bad faith, it’s an obstacle to the discussion for the April conference, precisely at the conference! Return my theses (on peace, etc.

ZINOVIEV I have just (8 p.

I definitely insist on the insertion: “repudiation of state debts”.
Only today I saw an article in Berner Tagwacht standing for this demand.
And not a word there about petty pro-prietors, concierges, etc.
Why should we worry about them.
Simply say: “for the sake of the revolution and in connec-tion with it—cancellation of payment on all state debts”— that is the only serious blow at finance capital, the only guarantee of a “democratic peace”.
Unattainable without a revolution? Certainly.
This is no argument against such a point, but an argument for revolution.
Certainly.
There isn’t the shadow of any reason to disagree with the Dutch and Berner Tagwacht on this score.
Tomorrow I shall be sending you a long letter.

ZINOVIEV In your version of the “history” of “disagreements” there are factual inaccuracies.
For instance, before my de-parture from Berne, and not at our last meeting, we discussed this point, and I not only did not “let it drift past my ears”, but answered at length and repeatedly, and you did not indi-cate by a single word, neither then nor a whole month later, that this question was still an open one to you, that it was in the form of an ultimatum, etc.
But, of course, if you are bent on “squabbles”, in one form or another, then you have no interest in the facts, and I am in no position to prevent you.
It is left for me to choose one of the two alternatives you propose.
I choose the first.

I don’t agree with you about Alexander.
Unless we see eye to eye (you and me) I shall abstain, and you can re-solve by one vote that “we have decided to call him”.
(1) To show him at the conference would be his undoing.
That is clear.
In Sweden and Norway the Russian Govern-ment has no sleuths, but here the place is alive with them.
Martov & Co.
will tell the world.
I am absolutely against his appearing at the conference.
I do not abstain, I am against.
(2) Alexander himself is demanding a man to be sent to Russia (I shall write to Ludmila).
(3) Since Alexander is not going, we should wait a bit and call him on the eve of his departure.
Otherwise it will all be to no purpose.
(4) There is no need to hurry, all the more as Alexander will be influenced by Kievsky; we must bide our time, ex-change letters, etc.
(By hastening Alexander’s arrival you will be hastening his going over to Bukharin & Co.

But if we wait a bit, the C.

What for? Over what? If he is not going, we have nothing to fight over.

) What about Radek’s theses? We must wait a bit with the No.

It is extremely important to squelch Radek’s theses right away.

After your removal it appears that you came to an agreement, all three, on the “theses”, 447 for which we can bear no responsibility either directly or indirectly, not even recognise any proximity to them, leave alone equality, in our Party.
If you wish to persist in them and in such an “agreement” and in federation, we can only regret it.
You ask about contributions—to what journal? Kommu-nist has been suspended owing to breach of the temporary agreement.
That means to a new journal? That is, to yours, on the basis of the “theses”? We cannot contribute and shall be compelled to fight it, since we find your attitude to the Party’s Programme (§ 9) to be not only wrong and harmful, but frivolous.
Really, during 8 months of agree-ment and life together you three never once drew a pen on this question, which has a 12-year history within the Party, never once made a statement in the Editorial Board of the C.
O.
, never once attempted to refer back to Party literature, etc.
Your arguments for a “free” journal (free from the Party Programme? from the central bodies of the Party?) are just as frivolous, if not worse—anti-Party.
If you wish to persist in the theses, we (1) are prepared to publish them and (2) we are bound to give our opinion: publish them yourselves (if you do not want us to do it) and furnish them with a discussion pamphlet in which all three of you could make clear to the Party your motives.
P.
S.
You write that the question of money is “unpleas-ant”.
Not always.
When money is treated in a true Party manner, it is a pleasant thing to the Party.
When money is used as a weapon against the Party, it is indeed “unpleas-ant”, even worse than unpleasant.

ZINOVIEV Today I sent you a parcel.
(1) I am sending our theses; whole sentences have been omitted from them.
Please insert them immediately (you have the rough copy) and return to me at once (for Platten).
(2) Have you another copy? I am afraid Grimm may let us down.
That will leave us without our theses on the eve of the conference, and at the conference!! (3) I am a bit uncertain whether it is worth while my going to the conference.
There is no mandate (from the Letts) and there probably won’t be.
To attend as a “guest” would be rather awkward, I’m afraid; I may be turned away for all I know (the decision of the 5-8.
II.
1916 meeting is not binding on the conference).
448 What does Radek say to this? (4) Is Radek “hiding” Fröhlich or not? A number of meet-ings of the Lefts and formal conferences are needed.
(5) Fröhlich and others will be arrested (I assure you) if they live in Berne.
It is our duty to tell Fröhlich and the others: if you don’t want to be arrested, go to some secluded nook (somewhere near the conference; Grimm should tell them where it will be); that’s the only way to avoid arrest.
And a meeting of the Lefts could be arranged there.
Talk it over with Radek and Fröhlich (what about the Serb? * You say nothing about him) and let me know.
(6) The Ledebourites, that is the Kautskyites, will pro-bably mess up the whole conference!! Everyone will be look-ing at them!! How many will there be from the I.

ZINOVIEV I am not sending this by express, as it would only waken you, according to my reckoning, without appreciably saving any time.
I quite agree with you about inviting the French and promising 50 frs.
Advise the Brest people to travel via George: it is im-portant that he and we should “intercept” them first in-stead of Grimm (if possible it would be good to do the same with the Parisians 449 ).
I haven’t had time yet to read the indictment.
450 I shan’t be long.
If you like, I’ll send you Sukhanov’s new pamphlet, if you promise me Junius * (for 1 2 day at least.
Get it from Radek, but don’t mention me).
Neither Platten nor Nobs have it.
It would be extremely useful for the cause for Alexander first to work a little in England.
It is dangerous at present to go to Russia, we shall be ruining a good man (in Sweden as well as in Russia).
Coming here just now is harmful, since he and you will not be able to restrain yourselves, and we shall only be sullying a valuable man at the con-ference.

ZINOVIEV (1) Vorbote obviously will not come out before the con-ference.
It is necessary immediately to order as many print-ed copies of our theses as possible.
And quickly too.
(2) Have you made the insertions in German? (3) I don’t know what material I have to collect.
You should collect it and write to me what is missing.
Otherwise nothing will come of it.
(4) Send me the proofs of the protest against Martov.
(5) I know nothing about the Scandinavians.
4 5 2 Two letters have been sent to Kollontai.
There is little hope after the events in Stockholm (6) My personal finances are not altogether hopeless: whence these “false rumours”??? (7) Did you receive the parcel? (8) Will you send the German theses (the corrected copy) which I have sent you?(9) I cannot come on Friday.
I have a lot of work to do and I am very late with it.
Since Radek has no theses and there are no hopes of com-ing to an agreement with him (on the question of annexa-tions and the right to self-determination), the “bureau” for the time being is useless.
It will be useful in the evening on the 2nd day of the conference, when the composition will have become clear.
(10) Can’t you give me a more exact address besides the name of the village you have given me? 453 The collection of material for the war with Martov is very important.
Attend to this carefully and in good time, otherwise we shall be late in finding the missing material.

Since these conditions have not been fully accepted, I con-sider that the agreement has not gone through.
This is now final.
It is no use talking and writing about this any more.
These people confirm my worst suppositions—a desire to hide behind Radek, without working on their own, and to shuffle responsibility off onto me!! This is the end! Write me more fully about your trip.

ZINOVIEV You are 1,000 times wrong about the Japs.
Let them publish separately in their own name.
We can’t have them shuffling off the responsibility for this folly upon us: let them answer for it themselves.
I am for a discussion, but not for an agreement with the Editorial Board of “imperial-ist Economists”, and I shall have nothing whatever to do with such a journal, as I have written many a time.
This must be put an end to.
It’s no use dragging it out.
We must announce Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
About the Distributing Committee, there can be no question of having it transferred here.
We have no one here, while in Berne we have Zina& Inessa (how could you allow her to leave?? I’m surprised!!)& Shklovsky& Ilyin& Karpinsky& Kasparov.
They must be organised and none of them allowed to leave.
I would like very much to get Avanti!, as I see it here only in the library.
I have not seen what you write about.
We cannot promise A—der 100-150 frs.
460 You can’t throw promises about and then find you haven’t got the money (“pressure on the groups” are mere words).
A six-month trip can only do good, as he won’t be going homebefore that in any case, and Norway is only a place for scandal.
The Stellungnahme should be put in, as the Manifesto and all the rest are all poor.
We must show that we said this before more exactly and fully.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear A.
, I received your nervy letter 465 and hasten to answer you immediately.
You have obviously been fretting a good deal.
You have no reason to.
Everything has been sent to you.
If you haven’t received anything, then one or another cen-sor has not let it through.
Zina assures me that she has sent you everything, and if she says she has, she has.
If the censor does not let things through, one must havepatience, patience, and persistence.
Expect another letter from N.
K.
I have read the material.
466 A lot of splendid stuff.
Espe-cially the article on the war industries committees.
Alto-gether, the collector of this material has done a splendid job—my sincerest greetings to him again and again.
I have already written to you about the absolute necessity of terminating all talks with the Japs & Co.
and I stand by this.
A year (!!) has passed since “the differences”, and the people have not been thinking, not been working, only hiding behind others’ backs and talking scandal.
If they still fail to understand that it is dishonest (to throw the responsibility onto us, for I am responsible if I form a bloc with an Editorial Board of muddleheaded views), then they are hopeless.
And if they want to “publish” and bear the responsibility themselves, then let them publish the pamphlet themselves, they have the money; it’s no use hiding behind others.
Let them give an article to the C.
O.
themselves—we shall put it in!! We must think seriously about Belenin, 467 please think of it, I beg you.
The Japs are obviously incapable of doing transport work.
Is there anybody else in the town * where Belenin recently was? Couldn’t he give this job to some foreigner (they are better than the Russians: more reliable, if slower)? If Belenin is to go away, it shouldn’t be for more than 2 year.
It would be better though to find work in Copenhagen: I’m sure that’s possible.
How much does Belenin need a month to live on? Answer.
Put off all personal cares and think, in the interests of the cause, how best Belenin can fix himself up for 2 year.
Frankly, he will only wear his nerves thin among the Japs.
They are shallow, mean people, really! I wish you all the best, and beg for two words of immediate reply.

About the Japs, you are entirely wrong.
You don’t want to understand that they are dodging a discussion, throwing the responsibility onto me and meanly hiding behind Radek.
If they want a discussion, let them publish the pamphlet (and bear the responsibility themselves!!) or give an article for the C.
O.
—we’ll publish it! For a year the scoundrels have been hedging, and you vacillate and indulge them.
I shall have nothing to do with their editorial board or their collection and I repeat my proposal: that we put an end to this claptrap once for all.
About “guaranteeing A.
for 2 year”, I shall try to find out how much money he needs.
*** This can’t be decided at a guess.
For “trips” and 2 year living it won’t be enough; one trip has shown it.
Transport went and will go without him through his agents.
And since he is not going home, it will be more useful for him to go to America for 2 year than to sit doing nothing among idle riffraff and fret him-self ill.

468 I don’t agree with your amendments, and so I have decided for the time being to send my letter to Alexander without them * (for in bargaining one must not start small when dealing with such sordid hucksters).
I’m prepared to make concessions only in the discussion and income.
Change of name is essential, as it is of a basically different character (not what Kommunist wanted to be); besides, there are vital practical reasons for a change of name.
Alexander should not be put on the Editorial Board: this would mean calling everything into question and risking falling out with A.
This is extremely harmful.
It will work only if we here have the majority.
Otherwise it’s of no use.

This is the height of meanness! I’ll never agree to it!).

It was sent to you simultaneously with a registered letter on July 2, by registered book-post.
If you have not received it, what is to be done? I don’t suppose you can make inquiries.
I can do so through the post office, but it will take an awfully long time.
Copy it again? (Maybe in dupli-cate, sending one copy via Sweden, would be more reliable?) There is nothing in it the censor could object to, and I can’t make out why and how this could happen.

Now we shall have to use another: V.

Ivanovsky, let us say.
I advised there (if the word “imperialism” is so “horri-fying”) to change the title, say, to: “The Peculiarities of Contemporary Capitalism”.
Now this will have to be changed again: “Latest Eco-nomic Data on Modern Capitalism ” or something like that.
The titles (chapter headings) to be deleted (when sent to Russia).
Perhaps even the chapter headings should be changed? It could be done.
I would ask you to keep the present format (which is what I was asked to do).
No cuts can be made without break-ing it up.

Then let him offer his services (there, in Petrograd) to call oh the way at Moscow, Kiev, Odessa (where he is trav-elling) for the same purpose and for passing on the address for letters to us.
Teach him (thoroughly) to write with invisible ink and to maintain the strictest secrecy in Russia: he must act the part of a soldier who is going to Rumania to fight, and stick to that! We don’t know yet when we shall be back.

But afterwards? If their faction builds up and a struggle develops? If he wants us not to make a copy of his article or show it to members of the Party, we cannot agree to this.
We shall not conceal anything from members of the Party.
) I think the answer I propose will suffice for the time being.
Let him make himself look ridiculous.
We must have his article in order to show it to Alexander, the Bureau and so on.
This is essential.
I approve of your letter to Bukharin.
I suggest (not in the form of an ultimatum) an addition.
494 I think it best for the time being to send the letter only in your own name: it is not so official and, considering the tone, more conven-ient.
We shall discuss it; it is not so urgent as the reply to Yuri (had we not better get Yuri’s answer first, before sending your letter to Bukharin?).

PYATAKOV Dear Comrade, You demand for yourself very strange privileges in the Party.
It is unheard-of and, given any sort of Party attitude towards the matter, unthinkable that contributors should dictate terms making the contribution of articles contin-gent upon the editors inviting third persons, at the choice of the contributor, or “guaranteeing” that the Editorial Board’s reply (to an article it does not know of!) will be recognised by the contributor as a “comradely” one and so on.
In the interests of the business, however, we consider it advisable, by way of exception, to accede to your ultima-tum, namely: on Point 1—we invite the comrade named by you * or anybody else you may desire, who belongs to our Party; on Point 2—all contributors are always guaranteed publi-cation of their articles without alteration, if they so desire, or return of the articles.
Your wish here is not a privilege, but a gratuitous demand; on Point 3—all we can do is to send you the reply of the Editorial Board (or of any other contributor) to your article and leave it to you to decide whether you want both arti-cles published or not.

If you want us to discuss the differences you point out, send me your article again as quickly as possible and mark off exactly what you disagree with.
The phrases about the “epoch” have become empty phrases—Radek and others have shown this.
Did the “epoch” of 1789-1871 exclude non-national wars? To talk about “defence of the fatherland” in general is theoretically absurd.
For defence of the fatherland= war in general.
That’s the crux of the matter.

You couldn’t help noticing that I was extra-careful to avoid any sharply worded expression of displeasure in my first letter (which you have not answered).
I wrote nothing about bad faith: omission, too, is a mild, and not harsh expression, which includes simple forget-fulness and inattentiveness, and these are far removed from bad faith.
Why this exaggeration, this talk about “bad faith”? Where, in my own hand, have I written about 5 pages? Send it to me, if you are not yet persuaded that you were wrong.

2) It is part of a book, for the publication of which we already have an agreement; the chances of its being pub-lished, therefore, are real.
Double publication is a luxury we can ill afford.
3) The main and important things about the history of the International have already been said by you in your article in Sotsial-Demokrat.
4) The collection must be limited (α ) to Russian mate-rial& (β ) to highlights of the controversy, to vexed and mooted questions of the Party.
5) And defeatism—where does that come in? Write and tell me candidly what you think of thisproposition: from a businesslike editorial point of view (specifically) or from the point of view of grievance.
But our disputes and efforts towards agreement must ! ! continue in any case.
A 160-page collection, according to my plan, would give rich, extremely valuable Russian material& a discussion on self-determination (without Yuri *) &defeatism&Trotsky, &about the Interna-(Chkheidze), tional that is, everything that brooks no delay.
Cost about 2,500 frs.
& 400 to Ludmila (= ditto trans-port)& about 500 for transport=nearly 3,400.
We can just about manage that, and no more.

ZINOVIEV Well, now you’ve said it!! I couldn’t help smiling, re-ally.
You’ve written yourself into “court”.
.

In fact, any court in every case would find that to label a proposal to hold over an article as “uncomradely”, would make collegiate work impossible.
Luckily for you there is no “court”, otherwise you would certainly be “convicted”.
We still have to “cut down” though.
We have bulged out of the former plan of the collection (Russian material & the discussion on self-determination).

ZINOVIEV There is no conflict: you are imagining too much, really.
Recollect (or reread) my letter: I did not state that I was voting against your article, I only wrote: “write and tell me candidly” what you think of such-and-such a plan.
** You wrote.
And that’s all.
So the article is going in.
Yuri will “reconcile” us still more, I believe, 505 as it is precisely his conclusion that “in the epoch of imperial-ism” there can be no “defence of the fatherland”.
In fact, “in an imperialist war, engendered by the epoch of imperialism, defence of the fatherland is a deception”.

If we put the Swede& Norwegian in the collection, then we must include an article on disarmament.
It won’t take me long to write, a few alterations to my article.
506 But will there be space for it? We must decide.
Answer.
Let us figure out again how much our collection will bulge—it’s bulging enough as it is.
3) Reply to Bukharin.
Must decide this too.
If you do not wish to say that the main thing is differences on points of principle, then I agree to change it, giving two reasons (for non-publication): (α) technical and financial (β) on points of principle.
Send me such a variant (don’t forget to connect both parts of the letter in good literary style) and let us decide the matter quickly.
Of course, bear in mind that our reply to Bukharin is of great significance: it has to be well considered, and a copy must be kept.
4) We must decide about the Paris collection: make-up and size?If 2,000 5-sheet copies (= 10,000 sheets) cost 500 frs.

BUKHARIN 512 14.

1916 Dear N.
I.
, As regards the “ill-fated” article, as you call it, you argue very strangely, really, or rather you don’t argue at all, but get excited and skip your arguments.
Now just look, really—from a distance—what you make of it: “.
.
.
I simply have a feeling (!) that it is not a matter (!) of points of accusation (!), but ‘generally’.
.
.
”.
This is what you write, word for word!! How can one argue like this? It amounts to stopping the mouth of every person who wants to argue and discuss.
The Editorial Board’s letter gives precise indications and formulations of the differences, but you work yourself up: feeling, accusa-tion, generally.
.
.
.
You read a lecture “On the same subject”, and none of the O.
C.
writers “so much as mentioned anarchism”.
But again—is that an argument? There is nothing about anarchism in the Editorial Board’s letter either.
What exactly you said at the lecture cannot be established.
That the O.
C.
writers are foolish—is a fact.
But you add: “I gave it to them hot on other points”.
.
.
.
“Opportunism is fear of what the liquidationist-yellow Maria Alexeyevna 513 [Potresov] will say.
” Pretty strong.
Yes.
But it’s wide of the mark! For I maintain that Potresov here is right against Bazarov.
514 (1) Is this correct or not? You do not go into it.
—(2) Is it a bad thing for the yellows to be right against the er-rors of our people? You disposed of the issue by the use of strong language.
It works out that it is you who “fear” to give thought to the significance of Potresov’s being right against Bazarov! “.
.
.
You cannot impute to me denial of the struggle for democracy.
.
.
.
” I impute to you a number of mistakes on this question and point out exactly which.
But you avoid the issue.
You formulate three “statements”, alleged to be “abso-lutely indisputable and orthodoxically Marxist”, to which the first chapter “could be reduced ” .
But these statements (1) are so general that they are still a long way off from concreteness; (2nd and most im-portant of all) it is not what the article says!! “Neither Gr.
nor you even attempt to tell me where the heresy is.
” Pardon me, this is untrue.
This is stated most precise-ly in the Editorial Board’s letter, but you do not answer the things we said and pointed out.
Not a sound in reply to any of our numerous and precise remarks!! One of our remarks: you break off quotations from Marx and Engels in a way that misrenders the sense or makes for inexact conclusions.
You answer only on this point, and how do you answer? That “I know the continuation (of the quotations) perfectly well”.
“But on the points in question they had views which are not liable to misinter-pretation.
” And that’s that!! It would be funny were it not so sad.
“Misinterpretation” is just what we write about precise-ly; without examining a single argument or producing a single quotation (I compared them purposely; I did not write you for nothing; I compared more than one quotation!), you dismiss the matter: “not liable to misinterpretation”.
The blame rests fully upon you—instead of a discussion of differences, you wave the matter away.
No one accused you either of “heresy” or of “anarchism” in this connection, but we wrote: “let it mature”.
These are “two big differences”.
You not only do not answer our remarks, but you read a different meaning into them.
You can’t do that! “The article has been lying a long time.
.
.
.
” Now this is backdated cavilling.
We corresponded with Gr.
on this for a long time, as we had other articles to attend to.
You had not fixed any dates yet, and no one could know of your possible departure.
This is just cavilling.
As for “chucking out” and polemic in a non-break tone, I must say that I have not yet entered into polemic with you in the press, but exchanged letters with you before any polemic and in order to avoid it.
That’s a fact.
Facts are stubborn things.

Kievsky is for the press (not to you, but to P.
Kievsky) and we grant him a privilege we have never grant-ed anyone before: we send the article to him first for his “agreement”.
(Unfortunately, the copyist fell ill in the mid-dle of the work: that is why we haven’t got the article yet, and you probably won’t see it before your departure; but we have the mail with America, and P.
Kievsky will probably forward it on to you.
We cannot take it from this copyist and give it to another, because he is in a different town; we have no other one in view; he is hard up, and we can-not deprive him of even these tiny earnings promised him beforehand.
) P.
Kievsky’s article is very bad and he’s hopelessly muddled (generally on the question of democracy).
* That we always thought highly of you and spent months, many months, corresponding in detail and pointing out since the spring of 1915 that on the question of a minimum programme and democracy you were vacillating—you are aware.
I would sincerely be pleased if we had a polemic only with P.
Kievsky, who started it, and if our differ-ences with you were ironed out.
To achieve this, how-ever, it is necessary that you should go into the questions at issue carefully and attentively, and not wave them away.
I am very, very pleased that we both see eye to eye against “disarmament”.
I was also very glad to make the acquaintance of Franz: he must have had some good work done on him in the way of Bolshevik propaganda; no small credit for this is probably due to you.
The man tries to go deep into things and promises well.
I am enclosing the certificate.
Correspondence with Amer-ica can be conducted only through Scandinavia: otherwise everything gets lost; the French censorship is brazen.
Regarding America.
I wrote a number of letters there in 1915: all were confiscated by the accursed French and British censors.
* I don’t know what Grigory wrote you, and I cannot answer you on this point.
You call what he has written you “impertinent non-sense”.
.
.
.
H’m.
.
.
.
H’m! Aren’t you afraid of this being a “break” tone? I never push things that far in my polemic with P.
Kievsky.
I would very much like (1) To have the manifesto of the Zimmerwald Left pub-lished there in English.
(2) Ditto—our pamphlet on the war (revised for the new edition).
(3) To arrange, if possible, for the most important pub-lications and pamphlets of the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labour Party (I have only the Appeal to Reason) to be sent gratis to the C.
C.
(4) Cahan, editor of a Jewish New York newspaper, visit-ed me in Cracow in 1912 and promised me, among other things, to send publications of official economic statistics of the United States (these publications are given out to newspaper offices free of charge there), saying that his paper had such a huge forwarding office that this would be no trouble.
He did not keep his promise.
If you meet him, put out feelers as to whether it is hopeless or not.
(5) It would be a good thing to form a small group of Russian Bolsheviks and Lettish Bolsheviks capable of fol-lowing interesting literature, sending it, writing about it, translating and printing what we send from here, and in general discussing together and “pushing” all kinds of questions about the III International and about the “Left” in the international socialist movement.
If a couple of Bolsheviks were actively linked with a couple of Letts possessing a good knowledge of English, then the thing might work.
(6) Generally, give special attention to the Letts.
Try in particular to see Berzin.
He can probably be traced through Strahdneks.
(7) At the end of 1914 or in 1915 I received from Ameri-ca a leaflet of the Socialist Propaganda League with a profession de foi in the spirit of the Zimmerwald Left.
I am enclosing their address.
I sent them a long letter in English.
Probably went astray? I shall try and find the copy and send it to you, if you think it worth while on inquiry.
I also wrote to the Letts about the League through Strahdneks: must have gone astray too.
(8) There should be a base in America for work against the English bourgeoisie, which has carried the censorship to crazy lengths.
This to §5.
(9) Try and answer us without delay, if only by a couple of lines in a postcard, so that we can make an attempt to establish proper contact with America; and give us notice (1-1 2 months) beforehand of the date of your return.

I missed the post today: the P.

, and I was engaged at the congress.
The congress impressed me favourably.
For the first time during the war, not only a Left emerged at the Swiss * This refers to additions to the translated text of Lenin’s speech at the congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party (see present edi-tion, Vol.
23, pp.
121-24).
—Ed.
congress (in 1914 it did not exist at all, and in 1915 it only began to take shape) but it started to build up into an opposition to both the Rights and the Centre (Grimm).
No little credit for this is due to Radek; previously, in the summer, he had got things mixed up a bit, for Grigory wrote me positively that Radek had written him boasting that he had “reconciled Grimm with Platten” (a fine service!).
But Bronski is following a line that is three times more vacillating and three times more foolish than Radek’s.
Radek arrived and we “made it up” (relations had been strained to the verge of a break).
On the eve of the con-gress we managed to arrange a private meeting of the Left delegates (which I had been urging for three weeks, but unsuccessfully until then!).
This meeting was attended by all the Left leaders, the Young included.
* Radek and I easily carried through a resolution of ours, acting in concert and agreeing to acceptable concessions.
At the congress the struggle has already begun.
The first fight was over an appraisal of the Nationalrat group.
The Lefts attacked.
The speeches of Naine and Platten were splen-did.
Greulich’s defence of the Right was extremely feeble.
Grimm played at Centre again and by aid of “little amend-ments” obtained a unanimous vote (spoiling the game a bit).
He saw that the majority was obviously on the side of Platten.
Tomorrow there should be a fight on the ques-tion of Kienthal; we have taken a hand here in drafting a Left resolution; it is much better than the one of Nat.
-rat.
We shall see what will come of it! I’m like an old war horse in battle.

Printed from the original526 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, Instead of “imperialist economism”, you write that you don’t understand the expression “economic imperialism”.
The old “economism” wrongly posed the question of the attitude of capitalism to the political struggle.
The new “economism” wrongly poses the question of the attitude of capitalist imperialism to the political struggle.
I am writing about this at greater length in my article against Yuri (this “merchant” has “consented” to being published—that means, he will go into Sbornik No.
3 or No.
4).
The differences with Radek are of more than mere theo-retical interest for Russia (as well as for Germany, Britain, for countries with colonies).
For Switzerland—yes.
Grimm is an insolent beggar and a swine: he meanly attacks, not me (as Grigory mistakenly believes, being poorly informed by Zina), but Radek.
It was like this (entre nous): Friday evening we arranged a meeting of the Lefts (where Radek and I acted fully in concert) and adopted (setting up a committee) a resolution on Kienthal.
It was attended by Platten, Nobs, Münzenberg and some others, i.
e.
, all the leaders of the Lefts.
On Saturday afternoon, when the congress was on (it started Saturday morning), a meeting of the “Young” (and also congress delegates) was held outside the congress premises.
Münzenberg was in the chair.
The report on (our) resolution was made by Ra-dek.
I did not speak.
The resolution was adopted.
To this meeting (the door not being locked!) some ladies came un-invited—(Genossin Block (Bloch), a lady friend of Grimm’s and a gossip), Dimka (another gossip and a lady friend of Martov’s) and others.
Obviously, they “reported back” to Grimm.
And Grimm decided (believing this old wives’ silly tittle-tattle) that the “actual mover ” = Radek, and wrote in the press that this mover (Urheber) spoke “Vor einem anderen Forum”.
516 Kharitonov is publishing a refutation in Volksrecht.
I carried on strong agitation with Platten and Nobs fororganising (or rather, rallying) the Lefts.
* I am making a report to them on this (Platten has promised to arrange it).

If you do not agree to deleting it, then I advise sending it only to closest and most reliable friends in Ger-many, for example, through Radek.
Should you agree to alter the unguarded expressions (the letter, in view of the present postal systems, arrests in Germany and France, etc.

BRONSKI Dear Comrade, I think it desirable to have the following logical con-struction of the resolution (based on Platten’s resolution 519 ) (the phrase in brackets is from Platten word for word): 1.
“The present world war is an imperialist war.
” 2.
(“The criminal policy of peace”), namely, of Switzer-land, which may also become involved in the imperialist war, on the one hand as a result of this policy, on the other owing to the imperialist environment.
3.
Therefore, “defence of the fatherland” is a “hypocrit-ical phrase” for Switzerland too.
4.
Rejection in principle of defence of the fatherland, and “the strongest methods of proletarian class struggle”.
A fullest possible list of these methods.
Immediate demobilisation.
5.
“The complete destruction of militarism” not in the pacifist sense, but in close bearing on the socialist revolu-tion and as a result of it.
In my opinion, this may give us a good five-point reso-lution.
It goes without saying that I give no formulations here, and merely point out logical sequence and train of thought.

4 Printed from the original 531 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I have just received your postcard.
I sent a postcard to you in Berne, poste restante, a very short one containing a single request for your response, as your silence began to worry me a bit.
I am very keen now on the idea of publishing leaflets on Swiss affairs.
Something in the nature of a circle of Left-wingers has formed here.
This term is inaccurate, though: so far just a number of meetings (evoked by my theses).
Attended by Nobs, Platten, Münzenberg and several others of the Young.
We discuss the war resolution in connection with the tasks of the Lefts.
These talks have brought home to me most clearly: 1) how devilishly weak (in all respects) the Swiss Lefts are; 2) how poor is the “system” of influence of Bronski and Radek, who have been writing articles about the Lefts in other countries! The whole point is that everyone is willingly Left when it comes to foreign coun-tries: it’s cheap!! But when it comes to Switzerland.

Abramovich promises to distribute 1,500 copies of pam-phlets and leaflets (will you undertake to translate them? Systematically and regularly? Answer!), while Münzen-berg, with whom I spoke yesterday, the head of the organisation of the Young with 4,000!! German members, undertakes to distribute a maximum of 1,500!! Guilbeaux, to whom I sent the theses, * writes that he is very pleased with them and will use them as a basis for his newly formed Committee of Internationalists.
We shall see! I have read Humbert-Droz’s Plaidoirie!! 520 My God, what a muddle in his head! And this in 1916! A hopeless Tol-stoyan, I’m afraid.
Grigory writes me that in No.
25 of Arbeiterpolitik there is a paragraph on “Three Editors of Kommunist” 521 and that “Radek is taking the same line with Y.
B.
& Bukharin as Tyszka with Lyova”.
.
.

At last Grigory too has come to see it, although he still hangs back on the grounds that “despite this we ought not to break with Radek”.
Ha, ha! I wonder how you are fixed up.

Really, you are mistaken in thinking that I blame you in any way.
Not at all! I am sure that without your intervention it would have been much worse, as the publisher * evidently gives an ear to “outside” advice from the philistine camp.
It can’t be helped.
One good thing—you have succeeded nevertheless in saving some part of it (and a fairly large part).
All the best wishes for a happy New Year.
Yours, Lenin Written January 3 , 1 9 1 7 Sent from Zurich to Sceaux First published April 2 2 , 1 9 5 8 , in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda No.
9 5 Printed from the original 534 TO INESSA ARMAND I’d like to share with you my ideas concerning the fol-lowing plan.
I have set going my theses on the tasks of the Swiss Lefts, both in German and in French.
In this connection I have hit on the plan of founding a small publishing business and issuing sheets, leaflets and small pamphlets elaborating these theses.
* Maxim Gorky.
—Ed.
I wrote to Abramovich.
He answers that he undertakes to distribute 1,500 copies.
He has credit in Imprimerie co-opérative for six months.
A leaflet will cost 50-70 frs.
He promises to find out the details and let me know (I asked for details as to the cost of 2, 4 and 8 pages for 2,000 and 5,000 copies; the cost of the matrices; and~ how soon they can be issued).
But so far I have heard nothing from him! Told Abramovich in reply that the plan would have to be abandoned for the time being owing to difficulties, of which more below.
I was compelled, or rather impelled, to answer in this way by the fact that Abramovich appears to be in the blues or something: he sometimes doesn’t answer for weeks!! He’s not used to carrying on correspondence, if you please, and is in the blues!! You can’t work like this.
To rely solely on Abramovich in this business seemed to me rather risky.
Further.
I wrote to Guilbeaux—he answered: the theses are “excellent”.
Very well: will you help distribute the leaflets!? How many copies? No reply to this day! (Obviously, because of the plan for their own little journal.
) I went to Münzenberg: will you help? I will.
But we can’t handle more than 1,500 (this is terribly little!!)—we are overloaded with literature! I have no German translator.
Nobs half-promised, but obviously won’t do it.
What’s more, the party (i.
e.
, the Parteivorstand) is deciding only tomorrow (7.
I) whether to postpone the congress or not.
A lot depends on this, of course.
Such is the state of affairs that produced my “bold plan” and then its abandonment (for a time).
Would you care to tackle this business? Tentatively and approximately in the following manner: You will be publisher of the French pamphlets.
I take upon myself the editing (writing and editing).
You will also be the translator.
You would go to La Chaux-de-Fonds (for a short time, for a few days; I don’t think there would be any need to live there) and ascertain the financial and technical details.
You would also find out whether you could raise money (or get an advance) for this publishing business (how much?—I don’t know.
I think from 100 frs.
to seve-ral hundred, up to 300-500 frs.
depending on the answer of the printing shop and on what scale the business is contemplated).
You could visit several centres of French Switzerland (La Chaux-de-Fonds, Fribourg, Genève, Lausanne, Bern, Neuchâtel and so on—this list is given only as an example) forming distributing groups, reading lectures, etc.
, mak-ing contacts and arrangements, checking.
I repeat: this is a tentative plan of work at its widest scope (probably only part of it would be practicable).
A French publishing business might get the Germans moving.
I don’t think Abramovich is lying—he will distribute 1,500.
We can add a minimum of 500 for Geneva, etc.
Total=2,000.
We could make matrix-moulds so as not to risk losing money on a large number.
The youth leagues to be paid 20% for distribution.
(a) Will it pay? (b) And how long will it take for the money to come back? Everything depends on these two questions (a&b).
If (a) it does not pay at all, then we should not start it, for we have no donors.
We can only go in for what can pay for itself.
If (b) the money takes a long time in turning over, i.
e.
(this is most important), if the pamphlets are not paid for punctually and regularly, then the business either cannot be started altogether or else a large sum must be assigned to put several leaflets into circulation (there may always be need for issuing a polemical reply, as our enemies will not keep silent; the enemies have newspapers; to answer them we should have the possibility of issuing an extra pamphlet or leaflet).
The situation in the Party is such that a furious struggle may flare up.
These are the advantages and disadvantages, the bright prospects and difficulties.
If this idea generally does not interest you, or if, for one reason or another, you do not consider it possible or suitable for you to undertake and organise this publishing business, then please drop the thing without ceremony.
This will remain just a talk of mine with you on the subject of one of my plans (until I am eventually able, perhaps, to find a chance of resuming my plans).
If you are interested, then go and see Abramovich, gointo all this in a businesslike manner and drop me a line at once giving the results.
We shall then discuss the plan again together most thoroughly and exchange letters.
The leaflets, in my opinion, should be of two kinds: (αα) for the masses and (ββ) for socialists.
Both of them small: from to 8 printed pages of small size (small close-set type).
Subjects (tentatively): (α α )—against defence of the fatherland; against indirect taxation; high cost of living; introduction of socialism as an immediate aim; expropriation of the banks, etc.
(β β )—poor and sound arguments for rejecting defence of the fatherland; against the social-patriots and the Centre; against the Grütlianer 523 people outside and inside the party, etc.
, etc.
How to prepare for the party congress; a bourgeois-reformist labour party or a socialist party? The leaflets could all be under a single trade name, Svet, say, or any other name.
Münzenberg told me that they (the “Young”) would distribute even without commission charges, but that, I think, is impossible.
At 20% (1 c.
per every 5 c.
of sales price) they would probably distribute energetically.
I hope I have made this all clear to you now, that is, I have written everything I know (as regards plans and in-formation) to help you form an opinion of the whole enter-prise.
I would consider it extremely important to publish the same things in German and Italian.
But for that we need (1) translators; (2) more money.
So far we have neither.
I think that if the French job started, the Germans would find translators, maybe.
Possibly, the thing may not work with us simply because we may not be able to take the right tone as far as the French mentalité is concerned! This worries me greatly and scares me very much.

I wrote a very excited letter to Olga, which Karpinsky called abusive.
I’m afraid she took offence.
I shall write her an apology.
It has been hard to bear the fact that Brilliant has won Guilbeaux away from us.
But I see from your letter that this was unavoidable: given Guilbeaux’s weakness, we could not, of course, make head against the joint influences of Lunacharsky (poet!)& Brilliant (he has money, Grigory writes me)& Naine& Graber.
We shall wait and see what sort of organ they will have.
If you get l’Humanité and have no further need of it after reading, please send me cuttings (the text of congress resolutions; articles on the congress; the speeches of Lon-guet & Co.
; their resolutions; interesting articles, which are generally rare.
And so on).
524 On what a shameful resolution Longuet& Renaudel have found common ground (2,800 against 120!!) and Bourderon & Raffin-Dugens have gone over to them!! And Merrheim? Didn’t he vote together with Jouhaux for the pacifist resolution of the C.
G.
T.
!! Disgraceful! I connect this with Kautsky’s 5 articles on peace (the same claptrap)& the Italian Socialist Party and Turati’s speech of 17/XII.
1916 (the same claptrap).
The victory of Kautskian pacifism over Zimmerwald, which Grimm (appeal of the I.
S.
C.
of 30.
XII.
1916) 525 paints over with r-r-revolutionary phrases!! Just as in the II International: a revolutionary signboard& reformist essence.
I am starting a campaign (or rather, I wish to start it) to expose this lie.
And what a disgrace in the Swiss party! 10 days ago the War Committee (specially elected by the Central Com-mittee of the party) drew up 2 resolutions: 5 votes against defence of the fatherland and 4 in favour.
Up till now not one has been published!! The opportunists (and Grimm!) are trying their hardest to get this question shelved and the congress put off (on the excuse that the workers are not prepared! Actually, it is they, the opportunists, who are dragging out the prepa-rations.
.
.
).
They don’t want to conduct the elections to parliament (autumn 1917) under the slogan of non-defence of the father-land!! A shame and utter depravity.

All the very very, best.
I wish you good cheer and the best of everything in the New Year.

Printed from the original539 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, Yesterday we had a meeting of the Left Germans.
Mostly workers, some young people.
We haven’t got the work running smoothly yet: I have a dual, uncertain impression.
He’s a nice one, Nobs! A worker sent him a Left article about the mean trick in putting off the congress.
Nobs put the article in over the man’s signature, and the next day printed another article of a different trend; he mutilated the Left article, pruned it away, and I discovered this by acci-dent at the meeting, when I criticised the article in just those passages which Nobs had mutilated! And these are “Lefts”! Incidentally, it emerged at the meeting that there were contacts with the Lefts in Neuchâtel, who had previously come out against the opportunists.
It wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a trip there with addresses (or letters of intro-duction, which I could get here) and brief them, read them a lecture, make contacts and so on.
Did I write you that Naine, at a meeting of the Partei-vorstand (7.
I), had the honesty to speak against Grimm to reproach him precisely as “international secretary”? Olga writes me today that Guilbeaux delivered a report on the French congress, scathingly criticised the Longuet-ists (“he out-does you”, as she writes) and stood for a split.
That’s good, but he, Guilbeaux, has no base, he is a man of moods, he has no foundations, no theory.
That is dangerous.
He is expecting his wife from Paris, who is car-rying on agitation there.
Guilbeaux and Brilliant have agreed to adopt a resolution of protest against postpone-ment of the congress.
They are having a meeting of dele-gates on 22.
I to vote this resolution.
The day after tomorrow, Sunday, we here are having a meeting of the Bureau of Lefts (Grigory, Radek and I) on the question of a protest against Grimm.
We shall see! I wish you all the very best, and ask you again to make a trip somewhere, if only for a time, if only with lectures or anything else, so as to have a change, to throw yourselfinto some absorbing occupation, something useful to new and fresh people.
Believe me, work among the French is extremely needful and extremely useful.
I have received the book and catalogues.

4 9 Printed from the original 540 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I have received your letter and the cutting from Russkiye Vedomosti.
Thanks very much.
Dear friend! I know how terribly bad you feel and I am eagerly anxious to help you in any way I can.
What-about your trying to live at some place where there are friends and where you could chronically have talks on Party affairs and chronically take part in them? I received a letter today from Guilbeaux, a short one.
He writes that they are preparing a meeting on the question of peace.
I have written 4 articles (or chapters) on this for Novy Mir (they are said to pay 5 dollars for an article, which would be most welcome, by the way).
529 I am sending them to you.
Will you consider the following plan: I could let you have further material and you would prepare a French lecture on this subject, a highly topical one, and make the round of French Switzerland with it? It would be extremely useful to the cause, as there is no end of pacifist muddle in everybody’s head, and this muddle can be dissipated only by steady, systematic influence.
No really, tackle this, draw up the most detailed theses for your lecture (we could discuss them together) or else write out the whole lecture.
The French workers in Switzerland have no one to lecture them on the Marxist attitude to pacifism, and you could do that and give the workers plenty of food for thought.
Startpreparing little by little right now; the work will absorb you.
Believe me, absorbing work is most important and soothing for health and mind! I’ll send you cuttings from Bataille, 530 the texts of resolutions, texts from Avanti! (I can obtain back numbers of Avanti!—you can easily learn to read Italian; that, too, would be extremely important, as there are very many Italian workers in Switzerland, and they, too, have no one to teach them Marxism).
Grimm is calling (this is between ourselves) a conference of socialists of the Entente for 23.
I (to discuss their conduct at the conference of chauvinist socialists of the Entente).
We are preparing a sharp protest against Grimm (even to the extent of demanding his resignation from the I.
S.
C.
) for his despicable behaviour in the matter of congress post-ponement.
* I strongly advise you to look for Volksrecht (I shall send you the issue containing the resolution), Berner Tagwacht (you can have that sent from Berne, can’t you? Especially the issue of 8 or 9.
I) and Grütlianer (4.
I and 9.
I).
I shall be writing you more about this.
The meeting of the Swiss party’s Executive (Parteivorstand) of 7.
I.
1917 was an historic one: they have postponed for an indefinite time a congress devoted precisely to the Militärfrage!! And Grimm took the lead coming out in favour of postponement together with the social-patriots!! No, this is a thing we shall make him pay for.
We are having a meeting of the Lefts here today.
Grigory and I have written to Radek, inviting him and Roland-Holst and others to protest against Grimm.
We shall invite Guilbeaux too, but he is right out of his depth on this question, and your lecture (whether a public lecture or a talk in the Geneva group of Lefts to begin with) would be useful in the extreme.
Olga has written me that some Left Frenchman is arriving to see Guilbeaux (and she has put Guilbeaux up to the idea of inviting me to meet him.
I feel awkward about it, it’s inconvenient; I am not going).
But is it a Frenchman arriv-ing for 23.
I?? If you could spend some time around that date (23.
I) in Geneva and read (or prepare) your lecture there, you could probably run into the Frenchman from Paris by accident (the accidental part of it is important) and teach * See next letter.
—Ed.
him quite a lot.
Prepare your lecture or talk for 25.
I, will you?? (And if “they ” are not to return by 25, then, after your talk with Guilbeaux, put it off until their return: in this way you could “catch” both Guilbeaux and the Frenchman, eh??) You had better wait going to see Abramovich, as he wrote me yesterday that he was sending information from the print-ing shop.
We had better wait till it arrives.
All the very very best, and wishing you to come to speedy grips with your lecture (it will come in useful to you later in any case).
Yours, Lenin P.
S.
Pacifism now is the question of the day.
It is here, i.
e.
, on this question, that we must now teach (Guilbeaux and the French in particular) to present it in a Marxist manner.
Answer me on this point without delay.

4 9 Printed from the original 541 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, Only today, Monday, we finished the conferences on the anti-Grimm protest which we had started yesterday.

We adopted such an emphatic statement against Grimm (demanding his removal from the I.

) that Platten called it “political murder”.
This is strictly between ourselves for the time being.
It will take a week or two to have this sent to Roland-Holst and the others and get their reply.
I am pretty tired—I have got unused to meetings! I trust that you are not answering my suggestion about your French lecture trip not because you are absolutely against it, but simply because you are considering this plan with the idea of accepting it.
I am not hurrying you, and shall not repeat my persuasions, but I would very much like you to take a change of air, to visit new and old friends, I would dearly love to say a lot of kind words to you to make things easier for you until you get into your stride with work that will engross you completely.

As you did not send me the original, and I would hardly undertake a French translation myself, I sent it, of course, as you suggested, omitting the passage about Engels.

“ Well, well! I am surprised! We, Grigory and I, quoted this passage—more than passage: statement, declaration of Engels—many times, directly and indirectly, in 1914 and 1915.
Engels, it should be remembered, wrote this first for the French socialists and it was published in their Almanach du Parti Ouvrier.

feeling—if not realising clearly—that the war of Bou-langer&Alexander III against Germany of those days would be anti-democratic only on their part, but on the part of Germany (of whose imperialism there could be no question at the time!!) it would really be only “defence”, really a war for national existence.
And now, what the French themselves acknowledged in 1891 to be correct, you suddenly cry down, and how! And just before that, at a meeting of the Swiss Lefts, they (semi-pacifists, what can you do?) dismissed my reference to this statement of Engels’s with amazing frivolity of their own peculiar brand.
You did not say anything either about my article in reply to Kievsky.
My work with the Swiss Lefts, like my reflections on the absurdities which Radek has talked himself into, convince me more and more that on the vital question of motives for rejecting defence of the fatherland our stand is the only correct one.

Non-attend-ance of the French and Italians enabled Radek& Levi& Grigory& Münzenberg to tell Grimm the whole truth to his face.

I know about Marx’s English works; they are special things that I shall have to read in due course (I bought some of them in London and started to read them, but did not finish), but now I have no time.

549 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I haven’t had a single line from you for a long time.
You promised almost a week ago to write “tomorrow”— and not a sound.
Has there been anything special to pre-vent it? Drop me at least a line, if you aren’t in a writing mood, otherwise I feel worried.
Re 1.
II, I wrote you briefly, if I am not mistaken.
On 3.
II there was a meeting (strictly private) between Grimm and his friends& Nobs and Platten.
(Münzenberg and Bronski were invited, but refused to go to these Zen-trumsleute, and a good thing too.
) Nobs and Platten are weak-willed men (if not worse), and are dead “afraid” of Grimm.
They adopted some amendments to the resolution (of course, Grimm “tricked” Nobs and Platten).
I haven’t seen these amendments yet.
They should be published to-morrow (Thursday).
536 On the whole, the Lefts here, I must say, are super-trash.
Yesterday there was a meeting (meetings tire me; nerves no good at all; headaches; left before the end)—a general meeting.
Re-elected the executive of the whole Zurich organ-isation.
Elected Bronski too.
And would you believe it— the social-patriot scoundrels (with Baumann at the head) got up and walked out.
* We don’t want to work with Bronski!! And Nobs& Platten swallowed the pill and put through a postponement!! What a disgrace!! And these are Lefts!! And the Young are “afraid” of Nobs and Plat-ten!! I hear that Humbert-Droz has lectured already in Geneva and is seducing the young people with his idiotic pacifism.

It’s a fully Centrist, Kautskian resolution.
Grimm made a mess of it, and Nobs and Platten backed down.
On Sunday there was a congress of the cantonal Zurich S.

This is a great success.
Abramovich was to have sent you the text of my reso-lution (the practical part of which was largely included in the resolution tabled at the congress the day before yester-day (you will get it from the newspapers if you haven’t learned about it already)).
537 I think you ought to prepare a lecture (in French) on the three trends in the Swiss party.
The material—referendum& three resolutions (that of the Right, Grimm’s and the Left).
It’s worth it, really.
Humb.
-Droz, seeing that he is a Tolstoyan, should be fought all along the line.
Most definitely! It isn’t true that revolutionary mass action in Switzer-land is “impossible”.
What about the general strike in Zurich in 1912? And we had this action in Geneva and in La Chaux-de-Fonds too.
Now, during the war, action by the masses and even a revolution in Switzerland are still more possible (this would be of importance for France and Germany).
There is ground in the Swiss party for building up a Left trend.
This is a fact.
It will be rewarding, though not easy, work.
Where did you find the documents on Engels’s preface to the class struggle? In Neue Zeit? Do you know that the Berlin “leaders” have struck out of this preface its revolu-tionary end? Re the war (of ‘91) I am waiting for your remarks on that “central point” on which you say I was silent.

4 9 Printed from the original 552 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, If you send me your theses on the war question, I shall be glad to discuss them, of course.
As for your coming out against Golay, I don’t see why the idea of its being “awk-ward” should occur to you.
In my opinion, on the contrary, it’s anything but awkward and extremely useful.
We have got to come out as strongly and bluntly as possible against the ridiculous pacifism of the French (achieving socialism without revolution, and so on) and the ridiculous belief in democracy.
Golay, in my opinion, should be given a special and public trouncing for recanting the valuableadmissions in his pamphlet Le Socialisme qui meurt.
I con-sider this pamphlet excellent material for criticising the weakness and shallow thinking of the French Lefts.
I have received from you a copy of the Russian text of the leaflet (I am very pleased that you liked it).
But there is no sign of the French text!! Yet I asked for it to be done in duplicate!!! The thought that we shall be late preys on my mind—there is only 2 months to go until 1.
V and the difficulties of communicating with the warring countries are enormous.
As regards Usiyevich, you write yourself that he is “spineless”.
So I did not scold him for nothing (and I asked for the letter to be shown to you so that we could agree on methods of influencing him).
So please hurry up as much as you can with the French and English translations of the leaflet.
If for any reason you couldn’t do it in duplicate, then at least let me know exactly when you sent the leaflet (French) to Abramovich.
I am ever so pleased to hear that you are coming out more often before the youth.
A useful thing! The young are the only people worth working on! Everything must be done to break down their pacifism and disbelief in the mass move-ment (what about the Zurich strike of 1912? And in Geneva in 1900 or 1902?).
It would be a good thing if you could collect material on the big strikes in the history of the labour move-ment in French Switzerland.

I have read Pannekoek’s discussion with Kautsky in Neue Zeit (1912).

4 9 Printed from the original553 TO INESSA ARMAND Dear Friend, I haven’t heard from you for a long time.
Things here in Zurich with the German Lefts are as bad as ever.
After Nobs and Platten crossed “back to Grimm” the leaders of the Young tagged along after them.
Münzen-berg turned down Radek’s articles against Grimm; Bucher and other friends of Münzenberg repeat the same phrases about the danger of a “split”!! It would be funny, were it not so disgusting.
.
.
.
I am urging Grigory to try a German newspaper (he is being offered 300 frs.
for it?), but it looks as if this last card will be beaten too.
I envy you and Grigory, because you are both able to lecture publicly.
After all, when you deliver a public lecture you have fresh people in front of you, workers, a crowd, and not just officials or officials-to-be, or a handful of people browbeaten by officials.
In a public lecture you speak to the mass, you make direct contact with it, you see it, meet it and influence it in your own way.
Apparently here, in Zurich, the fuss and bother over the German Lefts is over.
The referendum motivation and the resolution of the Lefts in Töss are the only fruits.
I don’t regret the time wasted, though (I am in a very angry state of mind just now, as I have come in from a meeting of the Lefts that did not take place: our people scattered!).
I don’t regret it because to my theoretical understanding of the rottenness of the European parties has now been added a practical understanding of some use.
Public lectures are a good thing, anyway, and they should be used for a direct fight against both the Centre (Grimm & Co.
) and the “Lefts” (like Nobs, Platten, Naine, Graber, Droz, etc.
).
I suppose you don’t feel like working on the translation of the leaflet into English? In that case, drop it: I’ll send it as it is to Paris, maybe they’ll find some Englishman there.

You did not “take offence”, did you, at my writing you about your not having gone over the French text? Incredi-ble! Incredible because Abramovich, too, wrote to me on the same subject.
Besides, is it conceivable that anyone can take offence at such a thing?? Inconceivable!! And on the other hand, the complete silence, for instance on the question of the English translation is strange.

Of course, if you don’t feel like answering, or even if you do, and have decided not to, I shall not pester you with my questions.
The Lefts in Switzerland have now scattered away from us both here and in Berne.

In my opinion everybody these days should have a single thought to rush off.
Yet people are “waiting” for something!!.

I am sure that I will be arrested or simply detained in England if I go under my own name, as it was England that not only confiscated a number of my letters to America, but asked (her police) Papasha in 1915 whether he corre-sponded with me and whether he was in touch with the German socialists through me.
It’s a fact! Therefore, I cannot personally make any move unless very “special” measures have been taken.
What about the others? I was certain that you would rush off to England, as only there could you find out how to get through and how great the risk is (they say via Hol-land, London—Holland—Scandinavia, the risk is slight) and so on.
Yesterday I wrote you a postcard on my way back, * thinking that you were doubtlessly planning and had decid-ed to go to Berne to see the consul.
But you write that you are undecided and want to think it over.
My nerves, naturally, are overstrung.
No wonder! To have to sit here on tenterhooks.

Probably you have special reasons, your health maybe is bad, and so on.
I shall try to persuade Valya to go (she came running down to see us on Saturday after having kept away for a year!).
But the revolution doesn’t interest her much.
Oh, yes, I nearly forgot.
What you could and should do immediately in Clarens is to start looking out for pass-ports (α ) among Russians who would agree to give theirs (without them knowing it’s for me) to enable another per-son to leave the country; (β ) among Swiss men or women who would give theirs to a Russian.
Anna Yevg.
and Abram should be made immediately to go to the embassy to get a pass (if they are refused, to complain by wire to Milyukov and Kerensky) and leave, or, if they don’t intend to leave, to let us know on the basis of facts (and not words) what the procedure is for getting a pass.
All the best, Yours, Lenin * See previous letter.

In Clarens (and the vicinity) there are many wealthy and not-so-wealthy Russian social-patriots, etc.

Why not? I cannot do it.

can.

We have more money for the journey than I thought, enough for 10-12 persons.

KARPINSKY AND SOPHIA RAVICH Dear Friends, Things are going well.
The plan, of which Comrade Mi-nin knows, is being carried out.
Platten takes everything upon himself.
Below I am giving you a copy of the condi-tions which Platten has submitted.
Apparently they will be accepted.
Otherwise we shall not go.
Grimm is still trying * April 4.
—Ed.
to persuade the Mensheviks, but we are acting entirely on our own, of course.
We think we shall leave on Friday, Wednesday and Saturday.
And now this.
We want a detailed protocol to be drawn up about everything before we leave.
Platten, Levi (of Berner Tagwacht, representing the press) and others will be invited to sign it.
French participation would be highly desirable.
N.
B.
Talk it over immediately with Guilbeaux, explain the situation to him, show him the terms, and if he sympathises, ask him to come at a wire from here (expenses defrayed).
This would be very impor-tant.
It is highly probable that we shall also invite Charles Naine (Platten will talk it over with him on the telephone).
Still more important: if Guilbeaux sympathises, perhaps N.
B.
he could get Romain Rolland too to sign.
Extremely im-portant: there was a paragraph in Petit Parisien that Mi-lyukov has threatened to prosecute everybody who comes in through Germany.
Tell Guilbeaux this.
French participa-tion, in view of this, is especially important.
Answer im-mediately.
Sincerely yours.

In Moscow a daily appears—Sotsial-Demokrat.
In Kharkov, Kronstadt and Helsingfors, too, there are dailies.
The All-Russia conference starts tomorrow; up to 300 delegates are expected.
Petrograd is seething; meetings and demonstrations are going on since yesterday over the govern-ment’s Note.

Arranging messen-gers is no easy job, but we shall nevertheless take measures.

You will learn it all from Pravda, which we are sending you.
Telegrams don’t reach destination.
The question of organising tele-graphic communication therefore remains open.

I fully agree with you that Zimmerwald has become a hindrance and that the sooner we break with it the better (you know that I disagree with the conference on this point).

D.
P.
L.
* groups submitted to the Legal Committee, I ask the Committee to take into consideration that the point in this statement “demanding an explanation” from Hanecki is an absolutely impermissible attack on the honour of an absent comrade (absent on Party business) and an agent of the C.
C.
at that.
To “demand an explanation” at the word of an avowed slanderer, Mr.
Zaslavsky, who has repeatedly been called a slanderer in the newspaper, is generally impermissible, and especially impermissible is it to have this done through the press.
Mr.
Zaslavsky acted only as a scandalmonger.
A clear legal line should be drawn between the notion of a scandal-monger or slanderer and a denouncer (who demands the establishment of demonstrable facts).
The principle should be established that the Party should not answer scandalmongering and slander (if only by re-peating that a slanderer is a slanderer) until (1) a precise accusation is made in the press over the signature of a defi-nite person who is not an avowed slanderer, (2) an accusation which should allow both parties to appear in a court of law, (3) an accusation of a serious nature supported by political organisations.
Failing this, the comrade affected, and not the Party, should answer the accusation either in a special pamphlet (or leaflet: with documents) or merely sweeping aside the scandalmongering.
Especially impermissible is the shadow of any doubt as to the honesty of a Party functionary or the slightest attempt to rummage (“demand an explanation”) in his private life without a preliminary questioning of witnesses (Rozanov, Chudnovsky, Schter and other Copenhageners) and a study of documents.
I request the Legal Committee to consider this statement of mine concerning the absolute impermissibility of such * Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania.

1917 Dear Radek, Owing to illness I was unable to follow reports during the last few days.
I therefore have a vague idea of Zimmer-wald affairs.
If it’s true that that muddled wretched Grimm (no wonderwe never trusted that ministeriable scoundrel!) has handed over all Zimmerwald affairs to the Left Swedes and that the latter are convening a Zimmerwald conference within the next few days, then I—personally (I am writing this only in my own name)—would strongly warn against hav-ing anything to do with Zimmerwald.
“What a good chance this is to seize the Zimmerwald International now,” Grigory said today.
In my opinion, this is super-opportunist and harmful tactics.
“Seize” Zimmerwald? That is, to take upon ourselves the dead weight of the Italian party (the Kautskyites and pacifists), the Swiss Greulich & Co.
, the American S.
P.
(even worse!), all kinds of Peluso, Longuetists, etc.
, etc.
This would mean throwing overboard all our principles, forgetting everything we wrote and said against the Centre, getting ourselves muddled up and disgraced.
No, if the Left Swedes have taken Zimmerwald into their own hands and if they want to muddle along, we should put an ultimatum to them: either they declare Zimmerwald dismissed at the very first Zimmerwald conference and found a Third International, or we quit.
In any case, that vile (“Grimm-controlled”—it is Grimm’s after all) Zimmerwald should be buried at all costs and a real Third International founded of the Lefts alone and against the Kautskyites alone.
Better a small fish than a big beetle.
Read this letter to Orlovsky and Hanecki.
My best re-gards.
Excuse the brevity—I’m ill.
Things here mostly resemble the eve of the June days of 1848.
The Mensheviks and S.
R.

In the early nineties it was taken over by the liberal Narodniks headed by N.

It propounded reconciliation with the tsarist government and waged an implacable struggle against Marxism and the Russian Marxists.

41 4In this letter Lenin evidently refers to his What the “Friends of the People” Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats, which was proposed to be published abroad (see present edition, Vol.

The two works mentioned are Frederick Engels’s The Housing Question and “Afterword to On Social Relations in Russia” (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works in two volumes, Vol.

546-634, and Marx/Engels, Werke, Bd.

44 8A St.

It published and circulated works by Karl Marx, N.
G.
Chernyshevsky, D.
I.
Pisarev, and N.
Flerovsky (V.
V.
Bervi); it had a printery of its own in Switzerland.
Later the group conducted revolutionary work among the workers and peasants, acquainted the workers with the history of the international proletarian movement, and sponsored the study in circles of the first volume of Marx’s Capi-tal.
They failed, however, to understand the historical role of the proletariat, regarding it merely as an intermediary between the revolutionary intelligentsia and the peasantry.

O.
Mar-tov, G.
V.
Plekhanov and A.

B.
Struve on behalf of the “democratic opposition” group.
The project was never realised, however, since Dietz refused to print the announce-ments as not conforming to censorship requirements.
Further talks between the representatives of Iskra and Struve were interrupted and never resumed (see present edition, Vol.

Ryazanov, Y.
M.
Steklov, E.
L.
Gurevich) originated in Paris in the summer of 1900 and took shape as an independent group in 1901, after the “Unity” Conference.
In its publications it distorted Marxist theory, rejected the revolution-ary tactics of Iskra, and was opposed to Lenin’s principles of Party organisation.
Owing to its deviations from Social-Demo-cratic views and tactics, its disruptive actions and lack of contact with Social-Democratic Organisations in Russia, the group was not admitted to the Second Congress of the R.

Most of the members of the St.
Petersburg Rabocheye Znamya group came over to the Iskra organisation.

p.
55 28The letter refers to the Iskra promotion group founded in Berlin in the autumn of 1900.
The group played a major role in the organ-isation of the transport of the paper to Russia and the collection of funds.
Similar groups were set up in other European cities (Ge-neva, Zurich, Paris, etc.
) where there were student youth and revo-lutionary emigrants from Russia.
They collected funds for Iskra, arranged for the shipment of illegal publications to Russia, obtained passports, established contacts and carried on other work for Iskra.
The neutral group of Social-Democrats in Berlin formed around V.
A.
Bazarov in the autumn of 1900.
Its aim was to overcome the split between the supporters of the journal Rabocheye Dyelo and the Emancipation of Labour group, which developed following the Second Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad.
Among others, the group included M.
G.
Vecheslov and I.
B.
Basovsky.
According to Bazarov, the group sent its represen-tatives to Geneva early in 1900 to persuade the Iskra and Sotsial-Demokrat organisations to effect a reconciliation with the Union.
The group published three or four proclamations on political topics and existed until the summer of 1901.
p.

30A conference of representatives of S.
D.
organisations abroad was held in Geneva in June 1901.
It drew up a resolution recog-nising the need to consolidate all the Social-Democratic forces of Russia on the basis of the revolutionary principles of Iskra and to unite the Social-Democratic organisations abroad, and condemning opportunism of all varieties and shades: Econo-mism, Bernsteinism, Millerandism, etc.

After the conference the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and its organ, the journal Rabocheye Dyelo, intensified their efforts to propagate opportunism, making it impossible for the supporters of Iskra to unite with those of Rabocheye Dyelo, and thereby predetermined the failure of the “Unity” Conference.

On the first item on the agenda “Agreement in Principle and Instruc-tions to Editorial Boards”, Lenin delivered an eloquent speech, censuring the opportunist activity of the Union.
When the op-portunist amendments and addenda to the June resolution adopted by the Third Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats were announced at the conference, the revolutionary section of the conference (members of the Iskra and Zarya and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisations) read out a statement saying that unity was impossible and left the conference.
On Lenin’s initiative these organisations in October 1901 united into the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.

In December 1902 the Southern League ceased to exist as an independent organisation.
As a result of persistent work on the part of the Iskra supporters in Odessa (Rozalia Zemlyachka, K.
O.
Levitsky and others) to combat the Economists and the Borba group, it merged with the Iskra organisation in April 1903.

p.
112 71Kautsky’s pamphlet Die soziale Revolution was published in Geneva in 1903 in the Russian translation by N.
Karpov, edited by Lenin.
The editors’ note on pages 129-30 reads: “To show the reader how great is the concentration of industry in contem-porary Russia we shall give two examples.
In 1894-95 the number of factories and workshops (i.
e.
, enterprises using mechanical pow-er or employing no less than 16 workers) in European Russia was estimated at 14,578, with 885,555 workers and output total-ling 1,345 million rubles.
Of these the big factories, i.
e.
, with 100 or more workers, numbered only 1,468, i.
e.
, one-tenth, but they employed 656,000 workers, nearly three-fourths of the total and the value of their output amounted to 955 million rubles i.
e.
, seven-tenths of the total sum.
From this one can judge how radically we could raise productivity of labour, increase wages and reduce working hours if we expropriated all the manufac-turers, closed down the small enterprises, and left only one and a half thousand big factories working two eight-hour shifts or three five-hour shifts! Another example.
In 1890 there were about nine and a half thousand handicraft tanneries in European Russia by A.
N.
Potresov, p.
106with 21,000 workers and output totalling 12 million rubles.
At the same time 66 steam-powered tanneries with 5 2 thousand workers also produced 12 million rubles’ worth of output!” p.

Later the report was published in the Social-Democratic paper for members of religious sects Rassvet (Daybreak) No.
6-7 for 1904.
The draft resolution on the publication of a periodical for members of religious sects was written by Lenin (see present edi-p.
115 tion, Vol.
6, p.
473).
74This refers to the “personal conflict” between Lenin and Martov at the Second Congress of the League.
Martov charged that in his report to the congress of the League Lenin had presented him as an intriguer and a liar on the question of the method of organis-ing the Editorial Board of the Central Organ at the Second Con-gress of the Party, and he challenged Lenin to put the matter to arbitration.
Lenin lodged a protest against this method of strug-gle, accepted Martov’s challenge, and in his turn pressed for arbitration.
The conflict was settled through the mediation of G.
M.
Krzhizhanovsky during his stay abroad in the second half of November 1903 by means of a mutual exchange of statements between Lenin and Martov.
These statements were published in Commentary on the Minutes of the Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad, Geneva, 1904.

three other conciliators—A.

The conciliators opposed the convocation of theThird Congress of the Party and dissolved the Southern Bureau of the C.

meeting or even informed that the question would be taken up, the resolution was printed in Iskra No.
72 on August 25.
On November 5, Iskra No.

The organiser of the expropriation, Kamo (Ter-Petrosyan), and all the participants in it managed to escape.
But the tsarist authorities informed the police abroad of the serial numbers of the 500-ruble banknotes seized in the expropriation; in December 1907, persons changing these banknotes were arrested simultaneously in Berlin, Munich, who helped the Bolsheviks p.

The Russian Government, having established Kamo’s identity, secured his extradition as a criminal.
During the search for the Tiflis expropriators, arrests were made in the Russian Social-Democratic colonies in Berlin, Paris, Munich, Geneva and Stockholm.
Protests against the violation of the right of asylum for political emigrants compelled the West-European police to release the arrested shortly after.

Grozhan, who toward the end of 1907, on instructions from L.
B.
Krasin, arranged a private loan to the Party treasury.
The incident may have been connected with delay in payment of the debt.

Lenin sent the issues to Zinoviev to be used as source material for articles in Proletary.
The article by L.
B.
Kamenev referred to was his “The Liqui-dation of the Hegemony of the Proletariat in the Menshevik History of the Russian Revolution (How A.
Potresov Liquidated G.
Plekhanov and Iskra)” reviewing the five-volume The Social Movement in Russia at the Beginning of the Twentieth Century put out by the Mensheviks, edited by L.

p.
219 155This letter was written in connection with the circulation abroad by some otzovists of a leaflet alleging that the Bolshevik Centre had declined to render assistance to persons suspected of being involved in an expropriation in the Urals.

5 of the Vienna Pravda of Sep-tember 20 (October 3), 1909.
Kautsky declined to lecture but welcomed the organisation of the school.
Observing that “it would be gratifying if the R.
S.
D.
could at last overcome faction-al division which weakens it so much”, Kautsky urged that philo-sophical differences should not be brought to the fore in either propaganda or the organisational sphere.

p.
224 159The letter sent to the Council of the Capri school read as follows: “Dear Comrades! Of the two prospects noted in our letter to you the second has materialised: you do not wish to carry out the de-cisions of the local organisations but propose to negotiate with the Bolshevik organ only as a separate exclusive group.
You know full well that by taking this stand you yourselves are im-peding further talks.
We can give you only one advice: publish your last letter to us.
” However, the School Council published its letter only after the end of the course in “Report of the First Higher Social-Democratic Propaganda and Agitation School for Workers” in Paris late in 1909.

In his reply of October 18, 1909, V.
A.
Karpinsky, who was in charge of the library, agreed to the transfer to Paris on con-dition that the library remained independent and would not function under the auspices of the Editorial Board of the Cen-tral Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, but would merge with one of the existing libraries in Paris.
p.
225 161A reference to a Bolshevik library organised by V.
D.
Bonch-Bruyevich.
In July 1905 Lenin presented it with over 400 titles from his own personal library.
p.
226 162The background of this letter is as follows: The Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat refused to print Lenin’s article “On Methods of Consolidating Our Party and Its Unity” as an editorial and suggested that he submit it as a signed article.
In reply Lenin submitted the question of methods of consolidating the Party and its unity for discussion by the Editorial Board and proposed a draft resolution on it (see present edition, Vol.
16, p.
77).
Lenin and Kamenev voted for the resolution, Martov and Warski were against, and Zinoviev, who in general objected to the adoption of a political resolution on this question, abstained.
Since the article and the resolution were rejected, Lenin submitted his resigna-tion from the Editorial Board of the C.
O.
The Executive Committee of the Bolshevik Centre drew up a collective statement to the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat from the Bolshevik members of the Board and the representative of the Polish Social-Democrats to the effect that the “incident”, being based on a misunderstanding, should be considered closed (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Ed.
, Vol.
47, p.
287).

For a number of years it was edited by Franz Mehring and Rosa Luxemburg and was the organ of the Left Social-Democrats.
From 1917 to 1922 it was the organ of the German Independents, and after 1922, of the Right-wing Social-Democrats.
p.
231 165Der Kampf—a monthly, organ of the Austrian Social-Democrats, published in Vienna from 1907 to 1934.
Its orientation was op-portunist, Centrist, camouflaged with Left phraseology.

Ekk (Mukhin) was accused of unseemly behaviour.
The case was examined in 1909 by a special commission which found that there was “no grounds for bringing Ekk before a Party court”.
Ekk was not informed of this decision; in reply to an inquiry ad-dressed to F.
E.
Dzerzhinsky (Yuzef), he received an answer dated March 9, 1910, that the C.
C.
of the Party had “endorsed the decision of the commission as it stood”.
Later, however, theEkk case was reopened; the last commission was unable to complete the investigation in view of the outbreak of the First World War.

Its composition was as follows: from the Bolsheviks, Lenin and G.
Y.
Zinoviev; from the Mensheviks Y.
O.
Martov and F.
I.
Dan, and from the Polish Social-Demo-crats, A.
Warski.
When Martov and Dan found themselves in the minority on one or another question, they created conflicts and complained to the Central Committee Bureau Abroad about the Bolsheviks and the representative of Polish Social-Democracy.
The C.
C.
Bureau Abroad addressed an inquiry to the C.
C.
concerning the “extent of the jurisdiction of the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad in matters relating to conflicts arising in the Editorial Board of the Central Organ”.
The Bolsheviks proposed to the C.
C.
that a plenary meeting of the C.
C.
be called to replace Martov and Dan in the Editorial Board of the Central Organ with pro-Party Mensheviks (see present edition, Vol.
16, pp.
191-94).

235 171A reference to publication by the Editorial Board of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata in February 1910 in Paris of a leaflet entitled “Letter to the Comrades” and signed by Axelrod, Dan, Martov and Marty-nov.
The authors of the leaflet charged the paper Sotsial-Demo-krat with having become an affiliate of Proletary and declared their intention to continue publishing Golos Sotsial-Demokrata.
Lenin analysed this document and gave it a political appraisal in the articles “Golos (Voice) of the Liquidators Against the Party (Reply to Golos Sotsial-Demokrata)” and “Party Unity Abroad” (see present edition, Vol.
16, pp.
156-64 and 185-89).

B.
Kamenev was delegated to the Editorial Board of Trotsky’s Pravda after the January 1910 plenary meeting of the Central Committee, which put off the question of making the paper an organ of the C.
C.
until the next Party conference, but decided to subsidise it and to send its representative to the Editorial Board “as a third editor”.
After the publication in the paper’s issue No.
14 of “Letter from Pravda to Thinking Workers ” in which Trotsky sided with the liquidators and the otzovists, Kamenev withdrew from the Editorial Board.
p.
243 177A reference to G.
V.
Plekhanov’s article “The Latest Plenary Meeting of Our Central Committee” published in Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata (Diary of a Social-Democrat) No.
11 (March 1910) in which he wrote: “.
.
.
what is Golos Sotsial-Demokrata for Men-sheviks of a certain orientation? It is in effect their factional— and, moreover, irresponsible—centre.
By voting for the resolu-tion pledging the closure of Golos .
.
.
our ‘Mensheviks’—members of the C.
C.
—laid down on the altar of the Party the heart, so to say, of their faction.
The skeptic will say that not all promises are carried out.
But, I repeat, we have no right to think that the comrades who gave this promise were insincere.
” p.
244 178The disruption of Party unity by C.
C.
Bureau Abroad member B.
Gorev-Goldman (Igor) referred to here consisted in the fol-lowing.

P.
, to take the most vigorous steps to put an end to the organisational division, to follow the example of the Bolsheviks and close factional organs.
Together with the representative of the Bund in the C.

Bureau Abroad, Gorev-Goldman voted against endorsing the letter.
This was made public by the Editorial Board of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata in its “Letter to Comrades”.

C.
was the case of V.
K.
Taratuta (Victor), a member of the Bolshevik Centre, who demanded that the C.
C.

The plenary meeting appointed an investigation commission which after a thorough inquiry unanimously agreed that there were no grounds whatever for accusing Victor of being a provocateur and cleared his name completely.
p.
257 188A reference to preparations for the publication of the newspaper Zvezda (Star) in St.
Petersburg.
It came out from December 16 (29), p.

Petersburg.
p.
259 191It had been learned from V.

B.
Since the amendment dealt with strikes of war industry workers as an expedient means of preventing the outbreak of war, the I.
S.
B.
proposed that the parties approach the trade unions concerned and report back to the I.
S.
B.
Lenin made marginal notes on the circular (see Lenin Miscellany XXV, pp.

C.
is to consist of 4 Bolsheviks& 1 Polish Social-Democrat & 2 Plekhanovites (variant: 1 Plekhanovite & 1 from Golos)& 1 from the Bund& 1 Latvian.
” This was followed by the reservation which Lenin criticises as reducing the first part of the point to nought: “Only after the Latvian and Bundist have formally announced on behalf of their organisations that they are withdrawing from the C.
C.
if it is thus constituted, will we demand as the ultimate minimum: 3 Bolsheviks& 1 Polish Social-Democrat& 1 from Golos& 1 Plekhanovite& 1 Latvian& 1 Bundist.

Veltman-Pavlovich (Volontyor), one of the lecturers at the Vperyod school in Bologne, was a member of the party school commission in March 1911.
By giving a one-sided, factionalist picture of the work of the commission, he incited the students against it with the result that studies were disrupted.

Vladimirov and other conciliators, and some Vperyod supporters.
A meeting of the group held on July 1 (new style), 1911, discussed the situation in the Party and adopted a resolution drafted by Lenin (see present edition Vol.
17, pp.
216-24) with a majority of 27 votes.
Ten votes were cast for a conciliatory resolution sub-mitted by the minority.
It is the conciliatory speeches of Lyubi-mov and Vladimirov at this meeting that Lenin calls “the worst repetition of the worst speeches of the Economists”.

The “ play of intrigue” on the part of the conciliators and the Polish Social-Democrats with the Golos group was expressed in the support they gave to Martov and Dan, who had withdrawn from the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, after the June conference.
The fifth member of the Editorial Board, Leder, issued an ultimatum that he would “withdraw” unless two other Mensheviks were brought in.
The conciliators sided with the Polish Social-Democrats.

Lenin supported the review of the Radek case, believing that the charges laid by the Chief Executive stemmed from the acute struggle it was waging against the Rozlamists.
The commission worked for five months and arrived at the con-clusion that there were no grounds for the party trial of Radek and his expulsion from the party, and recommended that Radek be considered a member of the Social-Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and of the R.

On December 7 (20), 1912, the decla-ration of the Social-Democratic group was read out in the Duma.
In December 1912 talks were conducted, on the insistence of the liquidators in the Social-Democratic Duma group, on the merging of Pravda and Luch into a “non-factional workers’ newspaper”.

with Party functionaries.
The absence of news about the beginning of this reorganisation caused Lenin grave concern, since in January 1913 Pravda again made a number of mistakes in its work.
On January 15 and 23 the newspaper published letters to the editor from deputy Y.
I.
Jagiello, Polish Socialist Party member, in which he advertised himself as a representative of the Polish working class; on January 17 and 24 Pravda pub-lished front-page advertisements announcing the current issues of the liquidators’ newspaper Zeit, the organ of the Bund; Pravda displayed indecision in the fight against the liquidators; despite the recommendations of the Cracow meeting, it did not pub-lish certain articles forwarded to it by the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad, etc.
On January 22 (O.

) a joint meeting of members of the Bureau of the C.
C.
, R.

, in Russia with Pravda editorial staff was held, attended by 12 persons, among them C.
C.
members Y.
M.
Sverdlov, G.
I.
Petrovsky, F.
I.
Goloshchokin, Secretary of the C.
C.
Bureau Vera Lobova and others.
A report was made at the meeting on the decisions of the C.
C.
and the Cracow meeting con-cerning the reorganisation of the Editorial Board; Y.
M.
Sverdlov was endorsed as editor of the newspaper with the right of veto and censorship of all articles; a member of the St.
Petersburg Committee was elected to the Board for the purpose of closer contact with the St.
Petersburg Bolshevik organisation, and Konkordia Samoi-lova was endorsed as secretary of the Editorial Board.
As a result of these measures, the general level of the newspaper rose.
From February 10 (O.
S.
) a Sunday supplement was issued in the form of loose sheets.
The paper’s circulation increased.
In a number of subsequent letters Lenin noted a considerable improvement in the work of the Editorial Board.

335 264Lenin is referring apparently to the paragraph “A Quibble” pub-lished in Pravda No.
6, January 8, 1913, in which Pravda de-nounced the improper conduct of the newspaper Luch, but made a mistake in quarrelling with the editors of the journal Rabochy Golos over minor questions not involving principles.
The journal Rabochy Golos (Worker’s Voice), organ of the Tex-tile Workers Trade Union, was being prepared for the press, but did not appear.
p.
335265This refers to N.
G.
Poletayev’s incorrect attitude to the with-drawal of Bolshevik deputies of the Duma from the staff of the liquidationist newspaper Luch.
Poletayev considered that mutual collaboration of Bolsheviks and liquidators in Pravda and Luch was permissible.
This point of view was denounced by Lenin.
p.
337 266After the appearance of the first number of Pravda, Poletayev left St.
Petersburg and withdrew from the newspaper.
His absence led to the closing down of Nevskaya Zvezda (“big sister”).
Lenin attached great importance to Poletayev’s work in Pravda.

p.
341 273Exactly what leaflet of the C.
C.
of the Lettish Social-Democrats Lenin is referring to has not been established.
Probably it is a notice about the convocation of the Fourth Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats, issued abroad shortly before, and published in the Central Organ Zihña (Struggle) on March 29, 1913.
The leaders of the Lettish Bolsheviks reprinted this notice in their organ Biletens (Bulletin) with critical comments concerning the agenda of the congress drawn up by the liquidationist C.
C.
, as it revealed a tendency to evade key issues of principle.
They criticised most sharply the point of the C.
C.
decision which stated the latter’s intention of making no preparations for the con-gress until 3,000 rubles had been paid in to the C.
C.
account for this purpose.
The Lettish Bolsheviks regarded this as a further attempt to put off the congress, the convocation of which was insistently demanded by the bulk of the membership.

348 282This refers to the re-election of the Executive of the St.
Peters-burg Metalworkers’ Union.
The meeting, held on August 25 (Sep-p.
347tember 7), 1913, was attended by about three thousand people.
Despite the attempts of the liquidators to set the meeting against the Bolshevik Executive, the vast majority, amid applause, adopt-ed a resolution expressing appreciation of the Executive’s activi-ties.
The liquidators’ list collected only some 150 votes.
The Bolshevik list, published beforehand in the newspaper Severnaya Pravda, was adopted by an overwhelming majority.
Secretary of the Executive of the St.
Petersburg Metalworkers’ Union up till August 25 (September 7),1913, was the liquidator V.
Abrosimov, who was subsequently exposed as an agent provo-cateur.

117 for May 23) and “Luch Against the S.
D.
Group” (issue No.
119 for May 25, 1913), Pravda defended the wrong action of the S.
D.
group in the Duma.
After Lenin’s remark, this error was rectified.
In the resolution of the 1913 Poronin meeting of the C.
C.
with Party officials on “Social-Democratic Activities in the Duma” Point 3 (h) was revised and endorsed in a new and improved wording.

In the same issue Pravda published the fragment of a poem by the American poet, Horace Traubel, a former workman “Common Men and Women” translated by L.
Stal.
p.
352 285Lenin is referring to A.
Bogdanov’s letter-statement “A Factual Explanation” published in No.
120 of Pravda, May 26, 1913, in which Bogdanov tried to refute the fact, pointed out by Lenin in his article “Controversial Issues”, that negation of Duma work and of the employment of other legal possibilities derived from “Vpe-ryodism” (see present edition, Vol.
19, p.
154).
Together with his letter “The Question of Mr.
Bogdanov and the Vperyod Group” (ibid.
, pp.
173-74) Lenin sent in to Pravda a paragraph directed against Bogdanov’s distortion of the Party’s history (this para-graph was not published at the time and has not yet been found).
After the writing of his article “Ideology” containing undisguised propaganda of Machist views Bogdanov was struck off the list of Pravda contributors.
p.
352286In April-June 1913 Pravda carried articles by Plekhanov “Under a Hail of Bullets (Passing Notes)”.
One of them was directed against A.
N.
Potresov, “Mr.
Potresov in the Role of My Accuser” (Nos.
112 and 114 for May 17 and 19, 1913).
Following this Pravda published no more articles by Plekhanov up to June 7, while Potre-sov, in his feuilleton “In the Grip of His Past (On Plekhanov)” published in Luch Nos.
119, 121 and 122 for May 25, 28 and 29, 1913, continued to “fling mud” at Plekhanov.
Criticism of Potre-sov’s attacks on Plekhanov is given in Lenin’s article “Work-ing-Class Party and Liberal Riders (On Potresov)” (see Collected p.

Altogether 19 numbers were issued.
The paper was closed down on August 1 (14).

L.
P.
in 1911, wrote for Zvezda and Pravda and took part in the insurance movement; in 1913-14 he was a member of the Editorial Board of the Bolshevik journal Voprosy Strakhovaniya.
In order to discredit the Bolsheviks the liquidators accused Dansky of work-ing in the bourgeois press.
The Party committee investigating this accusation found that Dansky since joining the ranks of the Bolshevik Party, had ceased working in the bourgeois press, and therefore recognised him as an honest member of the Party and qualified the accusation levelled against him by the liquidators as slander.
The question of Komarovsky was dealt with a second time by a committee consisting of representatives of the newspaper Za Prav-du and the journals Prosveshcheniye and Voprosy Strakhovaniya, 6 worker deputies, in the Duma, members of the staff of the Priboi Publishers and a representative of the “organised Marxist workers”.
The committee’s findings published in No.
32 of the newspaper Za Pravdu for November 10, 1913, under the heading “An End to Slander”, stated that “the committee sees no obstacles whatever to X’s continued contributions to Marxist publications and to his presence in comrades’ midst”.

The article was in response to “An Open Letter to M.
Firin” by the Menshevik Koltsov (B.
Ginsburg) published in Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No.
87, November 20, 1913.
Koltsov, who took part in the smear campaign against the Bolsheviks in connec-tion with the Dansky affair (see Note 298), accused Chernomazov of lying and slander because the latter declared that Koltsov him-self, while serving in the Council of the Oil Industrialists’ Congress in Baku, had acted in a similar role as Dansky, who was accused of political double-dealing by Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta.
In his “An Answer to D.
Koltsov”, beginning with the address “Dear Com-rade”, Chernomazov stated that he had read “An Open Letter to M.
Firin” with “a feeling of deep pain” and upheld his position in a polemic with Koltsov.
This document is a postscript to L.

Kamenev’s letter addressed to the editors of Za Pravdu.
p.
365 301This letter to the editors of Za Pravdu was the second letter writ-ten by Lenin on receipt of the first reports concerning the decisions of the December meeting of the International Socialist Bureau of the Second International on the question of unity within the R.

The December meeting of the I.
S.
B.
, held in London on Decem-ber 13 and 14 (N.
S.
), 1913, adopted a resolution on this point moved by Kautsky on behalf of the German delegation.
In a speech on December 14 introducing his resolution Kautsky declared that “the old Social-Democratic party in Russia has disappeared”.
It was to be restored on the basis of the Russian workers’ urge for unity.
In his articles “A Good Resolution and a Bad Speech ” and “Kautsky’s Unpardonable Error” Lenin examined the resolution and qualified Kautsky’s speech as monstrous (see present edition, Vol.
19, pp.
528-30 and 546-47).
At a conference held in July 1914 in Brussels in accordance with a decision of the I.
S.
B.
, the leaders of the Second International, under the guise of “reconciling” the Bolsheviks with the liquida-tors, demanded of the Bolsheviks that they cease their criticism of the liquidators.
The Bolsheviks refused to bow to this demand and continued their irreconcilable struggle against the liquidators, the enemies of the labour movement.
p.
366 302In connection with the December meeting of the I.
S.
B.
the liqui-dationist Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta (No.
97 for December 3, 1913) published a telegram from London reporting that the Bolsheviks’ demand that the Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma (the Six) should be represented by one of its members in the Inter-parliamentary Section of the Second International was rejected by the I.
S.
B.
As a matter of fact this question was not discussed bythe I.
S.
B.
and the Bolsheviks presented no such demand, since according to the Rules of the Inter-Parliamentary Section only one socialist group from each parliament, the one that had most deputies, was to be represented on it.
In the case of the Russian Duma this representative was one of the liquidationist “Seven”, who had a nominal majority of one.
This question was dealt with by Lenin in his article “How the Liquidators Are Deceiving the Workers” (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Ed.
, Vol.
24, pp.
p.
367 205-07).
303Apparently this refers to an article by Lenin in connection with the decision of the December meeting of the I.

His meeting with the delegates was exceptionally cordial.
The Congress, which opened the next day, was a turning point in the history of the S.
D.
Party of the Lettish Region.
It adoptedresolutions of a Bolshevik nature on practically all questions, except for certain amendments which the Mensheviks and concilia-tors contrived to wangle.
The Congress’s greatest achievement was the election of a Central Committee that took a Bolshevik stand and the passing of the Central Organ Zihna into the control of Bolshevik adherents.

This publishing business was founded in St.

Owing to increased persecution of the labour press by the tsarist government fol-lowing the outbreak of the war Priboi had to close down and did not resume publishing activities until March 1917.
In 1918 Priboi merged with the publishing house Kom-munist, which was formed as a result of the merger of various publishing houses (Volna, Zhizni Znaniye and others).

Part I of the collection did not appear.
Several dozen copies of Part II, which the publishers were late in taking delivery of from the printers, were confiscated.
The bulk of the edition, how-ever, was distributed.
Part II contained fourteen articles by Lenin besides the preface and the conclusion, which were also written by him.
p.
386 316This refers to a meeting called by the All-Russia Literary So-ciety in January 1916 in connection with the increased persecu-tion of the press and the reactionary bill on the press which the government was preparing.
The decisive role at this meeting was played by the representatives of the liberals and liquidators; a liberal resolution was adopted.
p.

393 322Elections to the Insurance Council in St.
Petersburg were held on March 2 (15), 1914.
A sharp struggle developed around these elections between the Bolsheviks on the one hand, and the liquidators and Socialist-Revolutionaries on the other.
The liquidators suffered complete defeat at these elections, three-fourths of the electors’ meeting declaring in favour of the Bolsheviks’ electoral platform and rejecting that proposed by the bloc of the liquidators and Socialist-Revolutionaries.
The defeat of the liquidators was further demonstrated at the elections to the All-Russia Insurance Agency.
Of the 57 delegates 82 per cent were Pravdists.

This accusation was quashed as far back as in 1907 by the decision of a committee of ten political convicts (Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and non-party people) of whom six were former codefendants in the trial.
The committee’s deci-sion was communicated the same year to Lenin and the C.

Alexinsky raised the “An-tonov case” again in 1912-14 with the aim of using it against the Bolsheviks, who, he alleged, had been “shielding a traitor”.

was shifting to the left.
Gipslis wrote that not only Riga’s largest 4th District but all class-conscious Lettish workers con-sidered it necessary to establish closer contacts with the Russian C.
C.

p.
430 349Lenin’s telegram to the Cracow chief of police followed a search of his house in the village of Poronin on August 7, 1914, madeon the basis of false information accusing him of being a spy.
During the search the gendarme officer took away the manuscript of Lenin’s book on the agrarian question in the belief that the statistical tables given in it represented a coded message, and ordered Lenin to present himself to the military authorities in the town of Nowy Targ the next morning.
On arriving there the next day Lenin was arrested and imprisoned.
His arrest evoked active protests on the part of progressive elements among the Polish public.
The Polish Social-Democrats Jakub Hanecki and S.
Bagocki, the Zakopane doctor and one-time member of Na-rodnaya Volya Dluski, the well-known Polish writers Jan Kas-prowicz, Wladyslaw Orkan and others came out in his defence.
At the request of Nadezhda Krupskaya, Austrian M.
P.
s Victor Adler and Herman Diamand, who knew Lenin as a member of the International Socialist Bureau, interceded with the govern-ment on his behalf and offered to act as guarantor for him.
The charge of espionage was so absurd that the Cracow police admitted that “there is nothing reprehensible here against Ulyanov” and on August 19 he was released.

All the delegates were arrested except the Bolshevik deputies, who enjoyed parliamentary immunity.
But they too were arrested a couple of days later, tried and exiled for life to Eastern Siberia (see Lenin’s article “What Has Been Revealed by the Trial of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Duma Group”, present edition, Vol.

This organisation made a proposal to the Georgian Bolsheviks to use the war for the purpose of uniting the nations oppressed by tsarism and organising a revolt against Russia under the auspices and with the material support of one of the belligerent powers.
In their reply the Georgian Bolsheviks rejected this proposal, which they regarded as a provocation on the part of the imperialists.

173 for July 26, 1916, in which he criticised Platten’s resolu-tion adopted at a party meeting in Zurich on July 24, 1916, fol-lowing a discussion of the activities of the Social-Democratic parliamentary group.
The resolution condemned the reformist activities both of the Right-wing parliamentary group and of the Centre, headed by Grimm, and contained criticism of the measures being taken by the Bundesrat, which might lead to an infraction of Swiss neutrality.
Grimm did not attend the meeting.
On reading the resolution he declared his disagreement with its various points and his intention of “laying down his mandate to the party”.
Grimm asked for his statement to be discussed so that he could hand in his resignation at the next union meeting.

L.
Pyatakov (Yuri) sent in his article “The Proletariat and the ‘Right of Nations to Self-Determination’ in the Era of Finance Capital” for Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
This article and Lenin’s reply to it were to have been published in No.
3 of the collection, which did not come out at the time owing to lack of funds.
Lenin replied to Pyatakov’s article in his articles “Reply to P.
Kievsky (Y.
Pyatakov)” and “A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism” (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
567 pp.

504This refers to the articles “Swedish Social-Democracy and the World War” by Karl Kilhom and “Certain Features of the Contemporary Labour Movement in Norway” by Arvid Hansen (published in the second issue of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata).
p.
568 505Lenin’s ironical comment stresses the error of and certain uni-formity in the wordings of Pyatakov’s and Zinoviev’s articles concerning “defence” of the fatherland (see Sbornik Sotsial-De-mokrata No.
2, December 1916, p.
27).
p.
568 506By the article on disarmament Lenin meant “The Military Pro-gramme of the Proletarian Revolution”, which he had written in German and slightly revised for Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, where it was published in No.

p.
573 510Lenin’s note and Krupskaya’s letter to Shlyapnikov were in reply to the latter’s first letter written upon his return to Europe from America (he returned to Copenhagen on September 29).
In his letter Shlyapnikov gave an account of the work he had done in America and wrote that he was planning to go to Russia.
In view of this Lenin, for reasons of secrecy, refers to Shlyap-nikov as “Bel.
” in his note.
p.
573 511Lenin is here commenting on Zinoviev’s article “ ‘Defeatism’ Before and Now”.
It was published in the first issue of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
Lenin’s remarks were accepted by Zinoviev only in part.
Point 2 of Lenin’s letter refers to the publication in Gazeta Robotnicza No.
25 for 1916 of the Resolution of a Meeting of the Editorial Board, held June 1-2, 1915.
The resolution attacked the slogan of defeat of the tsarist monarchy which the C.

575 514The journal Letopis No.
5 for May 1916 published an article by V.
Bazarov, “The Present Situation and Perspectives”, giving an analysis of the economic crisis in Russia caused by the impe-rialist war.
In this article Bazarov called the division of the Party’s Programme into minimum and maximum an “anachro-nism” and stated that the struggle for democratic reforms was needless.
Potresov in his article “Notes of a Publicist”, published in August 1916 in No.
1 of the Menshevik journal Dyelo, wrote that “Maximalist optimism” (this was how he characterised Ba-zarov’s views) which does away with “all immediate tasks of democracy” “is the greatest enemy of the democratic movement, its best and most reliable disorganiser”.
It is probably this statement in Potresov’s article that Lenin has in view.

The journal appeared from December 1915 to December 1917.
p.
579 516This refers to the editorial “The Party Congress” published in Berner Tagwacht on November 7, 1916.
The part of the article in which a very brief account was given of the discussion at the congress of the question of the attitude to the Kienthal Confer-ence, contained malicious hints about an unknown mover of the draft resolution and claimed that the signatures under this draft were invalid.
On November 8, 1916, the newspaper Volksrecht No.
262 published a statement by Ernst Nobs who wrote that he “fully shares the views” set forth in the draft resolution moved by the p.

p.
584 518This refers to the draft of a letter to “A Woman Social-Democrat of Germany” (probably Clara Zetkin) in which Armand, on be-half of the editors of the journal Rabotnitsa, invited an exchange of views on questions relating to the women’s labour movement and suggested calling an unofficial conference of Left women socialists.
The words quoted by Lenin are from the following text of Ar-mand’s letter: “It seems to us that during the war this movement (i.
e.
, the women’s movement.
—Ed.
) could play a very important role for socialism.
When most of the proletariat— the men—are at the fronts, the other part of the proletariat— the women—should take our socialist cause into their own hands.

519This refers to Platten’s draft resolution on the war issue, writ-ten with a view to the emergency congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party, at which the question of the attitude towards the war was to be discussed.

588 521The newspaper Arbeiterpolitik No.
25 for December 9, 1916, published in its “Our Political Diary” section an unsigned paragraph dated December 6, 1916.
Touching on the discussion of the question of the right of nations to self-determination in the pages of No.
1 of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, the writer stat-ed that Lenin’s views on this question were not shared by “three members of the Editorial Board of Kommunist, a theoretical review of Russian Left radicals”.
Such a report could only diso-rientate the reader, as it did not mention a word either about the theoretical mistakes or the anti-Party factional behaviour of this group after the appearance of Kommunist.
The same issue of Arbeiterpolitik carried as an editorial a short article by Bukharin entitled “The Imperialist State” with a footnote from the editors commenting favourably on his article.
p.
588 522In connection with the “Shklovsky scandal” Zinoviev wrote: “.

p.
594 526The newspaper Volksrecht No.
5 for January 6, 1917, car-ried an article on the party meeting held in the Zurich People’s House on January 5.

p.
603532This refers to the referendum on the question of convening an emergency congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party to dis-cuss its attitude towards the war.
Despite the fight started by the leaders of the party Robert Grimm, Jacques Schmid, Friedrich Schneider, Herman Greulich and Gustav Müller (see present edi-tion, Vol.

This docu-ment was signed, among others, by Grimm, Nobs and Platten.
The original draft of the majority, rejecting “defence of the fatherland”, was published in Volksrecht, January 9, 1917 (No.
7) over the signatures of Affolter, Graber, Naine, Nobs and Schmid.
p.
609 537This refers to the “Proposed Amendments to the Resolution on the War Issue” drafted by Lenin and adopted at the cantonal congress of the Zurich Social-Democratic Organisation in Töss.
This congress was held February 11-12, 1917.
The party organ Volksrecht, in its issue No.
36 for February 12, 1917, devoted an editorial to it, headed “Der Parteitag in Töss”.
The congress had before it two draft resolutions: (1) a social-chauvinist draft submitted by minority members of the Com-mission on the war issue, and (2) a Centrist draft from the Commission majority.
The latter was adopted by 93 votes to 65.
The Lefts voted for the resolution in order to prevent the social-chauvinist draft from being adopted, but they moved Lenin’s “Proposed Amendments to the Resolution on the War Issue”, whichwere adopted by the congress (see present edition, Vol.

610 538The reference is to Leaflet No.
1 “Gegen die Lüge der Vaterlands-verteidigung” (Against the Fatherland Defence Lie), afterwards issued over the signature: “A group of Zimmerwald Lefts in Switzer-land”.
Lenin took an active part in the drafting and editing of this leaflet, which incorporated his “Proposed Amendments to the Resolution on the War Issue” and a number of proposi-tions from other articles of his.
p.
611 539This letter (postcard) to Inessa Armand in Clarens was written by Lenin on his way to Zurich from La Chaux-de-Fonds and posted by him in Ambulant (Switzerland).
In La Chaux-de-Fonds —a large working-class centre of Switzerland—Lenin delivered a lecture (in German) at a workers’ club on the Paris Commune and the prospects of development of the Russian revolution (“Will the Russian Revolution Follow the Path of the Paris Commune?”).
p.
616 540Lenin is referring to the declaration of the Provisional Govern-ment setting forth its political programme, one point of which provided for a complete and immediate amnesty in political and religious cases (see Vestnik Vremennogo Pravitelstva No.

616 541Karpinsky invited Lenin to Geneva to deliver a lecture to Russian emigrants and Swiss socialists on the Party’s tasks in the revolution.
The meeting of Russian and Swiss internationalists mentioned in the letter took place on March 9 (22), 1917.
Lenin did not attend it.
p.
618 542Karpinsky wrote in his reminiscences: “One plan for enabling some comrades to make the passage was for them to marry a Swiss citizen.
This gave the right to entry both into Germany and Rus-sia.
This plan appealed to Vladimir Ilyich, and he advised Com-rade Ravich to find ‘a convenient old man ’ .
He recommended for this purpose the Menshevik P.
B.
Axelrod, who was a Swiss citizen.
” p.
622 543In Lenin’s manuscript in the Central Party Archives of the In-stitute of Marxism-Leninism the addressee is not given.
Probably this letter was intended for Jakub Hanecki or Inessa Armand.
Lenin asked Armand on March 18, 1917, to find out whether he would be allowed legal passage from Switzerland to Russia via England (see Document 555 in this volume).
On March 19, however, Lenin learned that she refused to go to England.
There-fore, he had no reason for sending this document to Armand.
In fact, in his subsequent letters to her Lenin makes no further men-tion of his request.
The date in Lenin’s MS.
is missing.
Judging by its contents, this letter was probably written after the afore-mentioned letters to Armand.
It formulates the conditions for the passage of a group of political emigrants through the mediation of the Swiss Social-Democrat Fritz Platten.
