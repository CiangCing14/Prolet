443 446 446 447 448 450 453 601PREFACE The additional volumes 41 to 45 of the present edition contain the most important of the new material included in the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works of V.
I.
Lenin.
Volume 41 contains works written before the Great October Socialist Revolution, from 1896 to October 1917, which are an essential supplement to the works published in the respective volumes of the present edition.
A great part of the volume consists of documents reflecting Lenin’s efforts in creating and strengthening the Bolshevik Party and working out the ideological and organisational principles, the programme and the rules of a new type of proletarian party.
Among them are: “Outline of Various Points of the Practical Section of the Draft Programme”, “Record of Points One and Two of Plekhanov’s First Draft Programme, and Outline of Point One of the Programme’s Theoretical Section”, “Initial Variant of the Agrarian Section and the Concluding Section of the Draft Programme”, and Lenin’s speeches at the Second Party Congress.
They show that Lenin helped the Iskra Editorial Board to draft a truly revolutionary programme.
The record of the Second Congress of the League of Rus-sian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad, the January and June (1904) sessions of the R.

Council, “Draft Resolution of the Majority’s Geneva Group”, “Reply to L.
Martov”, “Report on the State of Affairs in the Party”, and others show Lenin’s struggle against the Mensheviks’ splitting and disorganising activity after the Second Congress of the R.
S.

L.
P.
A large group of documents written by Lenin in connection with the work of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Congresses of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
is of great importance for a study of the Party’s strategy and tactics during the first Russian revolu-tion.
These documents contain propositions on the hegemonyof the proletariat, the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, and the development of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution.
Considerable interest attaches to the works connected with the elaboration of Bolshevik tactics in the Duma (Parlia-ment): the report and summing-up speech on the report on the election campaign for the Second Duma and other material of the Second Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(the First All-Russia Conference), the articles “Are the Menshe-viks Entitled To Conduct a Policy of Supporting the Cadets?”, “The Third Duma and Social-Democracy”, “Report to the International Socialist Bureau, ‘Elections to the Fourth Duma’”, “The Duma Group and the Majority Out-side”, etc.
A number of works dating from the period of reaction reflect Lenin’s struggle against ideological vacillations and deviations from Marxism.
Lenin waged an implacable struggle against the avowed opportunists, the Menshevik liquidators, and also against the “Left” opportunists inside the Bolshevik Party—the otzovists, the ultimatumists and the Vperyod splinter group.
In addition to the material already published, the volume contains 14 works by Lenin shedding light on the conference of Proletary’s enlarged Editorial Board which condemned both liquidationism and otzovism.
The volume gives a fuller picture of the meeting held by members of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Central Committee in Paris in June 1911.
In his “Report on the State of Affairs in the Party” and speeches at the meeting, Lenin defined the Party’s tasks in the struggle against the anti-Party groups.
The Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
brought to a close a long period of struggle against Menshevism.
By expelling the Menshevik liquidators from the Party, it strengthened the Party as an all-Russia organisation, capable of giving a lead to the masses in a fresh revolutionary upsurge.
The volume contains a number of documents which are of great interest for the study of the Conference.
Among them are: “Report on the Work of the International Socialist Bureau”, setting out important propositions on the new epoch, an epoch of socialist revo-lutions and “battles against the bourgeoisie”, and on theconsequent sharpening of the struggle between the revolu-tionary Social-Democrats and the reformists inside the European socialist parties, and “Speech on the Organisational Question”, emphasising the need to strengthen the Party’s ties with the masses and to combine legal and illegal work.
The volume contains Lenin’s resolution for the Cracow meeting of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Central Committee with Party workers, “On the Reorganisation and Work of the Pravda Editorial Board”.
This decision shows how the Central Committee, led by Lenin, gave effective and concrete guidance to Pravda, the Party’s most important legal organ.
In some of his works—”Reply to Liquidators’ Article in Leipziger Volkszeitung”, “Letter to the Executive of the German Social-Democratic Party”, “On the Question of the Bureau’s Next Steps”, “Russian Workers and the Inter-national”, “How the Liquidators Are Cheating the Workers”, “Resolution on the Socialist Bureau’s Decision”—Lenin gives a firm rebuff to attempts by the leaders of the German Social-Democrats and the Second International to “recon-cile” and unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks by liquidat-ing the Bolshevik Party.
Lenin’s struggle for Party unity is characterised by the documents relating to the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Latvian territory: his report and summing-up speech, and the draft resolution on the attitude of the Social-Democrats of the Latvian territory to the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Of the documents supplementing Lenin’s elaboration of the national question, the volume includes: “Theses for a Lecture on the National Question”, “German Social-Democracy and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination”, “Note to the Theses ‘Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination’”, “On the Declaration by the Polish Social-Democrats at the Zimmerwald Conference”, plans of an unfinished pamphlet, Statistics and Sociology, and “Speech on the National Question” at the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.

(B.
).
Lenin urged the need for the workers to struggle against the danger of the world war which was being prepared by the imperialists of all countries, and exposed the opportunists who denied that such a struggle was of any real importance,an attitude which doomed the workers to a passive stand.
He believed that it was a major task of the revolutionary Social-Democrats to conduct anti-militarist propaganda and spread the idea of international solidarity among the work-ing people.
This question is dealt with in the following articles: “Notes to the Resolution of the Stuttgart Congress on ‘Militarism and International Conflicts’”, “Notes to Clara Zetkin’s Article ‘International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart’”, “Anti-Militarist Propaganda and Young Socialist Workers’ Leagues” and “How the Socialist-Revolutionaries Write History”.
A number of documents published in the volume relate .
to the period of the First World War, namely, “On the Slogan to Transform the Imperialist War into a Civil War”, “Editorial Note to the Article ‘The Ukraine and the War’”, “Draft Point Three of the Resolution ‘The C.

L.
P.
Central Committee To Terminate Publication of the Journal Kommunist”, “Remarks on an Article about Maximalism” and others.
These documents show the Bolshevik tactics with regard to war, peace and revolution; they explain the slogan of transforming the imperialist war into a civil war, and characterise Lenin’s activity in rallying the Left-wing and revolutionary elements within the international working-class movement round the banner of internationalism, his struggle against social-chauvinism and Kautskyism (Centrism), and against the Left-wing opportunist, sectarian stand and splitting acti-vities of the Bukharin-Pyatakov group.
A number of documents written after the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia in February 1917 contain Lenin’s propositions concerning the Party’s attitude to the bourgeois Provisional Government.
The volume contains material connected with Lenin’s return from Switzerland to Russia in April 1917.
It will berecalled that the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois press started a campaign of slander and harassment over Lenin and the Bolsheviks’ return home across Germany.
This is fully exposed in the following: replies to a correspondent of the newspaper Politiken and to F.
Ström, a spokesman of the Left-wing Swedish Social-Democrats, the group’s communi-que, “Russian Revolutionaries’ Trip Across Germany”, speeches at a conference with Left-wing Swedish Social-Democrats on March 31 (April 13), at a meeting of the soldiers of an armoured battalion on April 15 (28), and at a meeting of the soldiers’ section of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on April 17 (30), “An Unfinished Autobiography”, etc.
There is also a newspaper report of Lenin’s speech upon his arrival in Petrograd on April 3 (16), 1917, when he addressed workers, soldiers and sailors in the Finland Station Square from the top of an armoured car.
Lenin’s return, his elaboration of a concrete plan for going over from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to a socialist revolution, and the open exposition of his plan in the press and in speeches at numerous meetings helped to orient the Party towards preparations for a socialist revo-lution.
A tremendous part in this effort was played by the Petrograd City and the Seventh All-Russia Party conferences held in April 1917.
Some of Lenin’s reports and speeches at these conferences are published both according to the minutes and the newspaper reports, which gives a fuller idea of their content.
The volume also contains “Report on the Results of the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.

A number of documents in the volume deal with the drafting of the Party’s second programme, which charted the building of a socialist economy in Russia.
Among them are: “Outline of Fifth ‘Letter from Afar’”, “Preliminary Draft Alterations in the R.

The Party’s policy on the basic aspects of the revolution, such as war, peace and the agrarian question, is explained in the “Speech at a Sitting of the Bolshevik Group of the First All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies”, “Report on the Current Situation at the All-Russia Conference of Front and Rear Military Organisations of the R.

The theses “The Political Situation”, which Lenin wrote after the July events, were published as an article in the newspaper Proletarskoye Dyelo, and that was how they appeared in Volume 25.
Here they are given in their original form.
They defined the Party’s new tasks and tactics in the changed political situation.
Great interest attaches to the “Letter Over the Publication of ‘Leaflet on the Capture of Riga’”, which was published for the first time in the Fifth Russian edition.
Lenin gives important instructions in the item “On the List of Candidates for the Constituent Assembly” from his “Theses for a Report at the October 8 Conference of the St.
Petersburg Organisation, and also for a Resolution and Instructions to Those Elected to the Party Congress”, part of which was published in Vol-ume 26.
In a letter to Y.
M.
Sverdlov, Lenin exposes Kame-nev and Zinoviev’s strike-breaking behaviour and voices his confidence in the victory of the revolution.
A considerable part of the documents consists of prepara-tory material, such as plans, notes, outlines and theses, which show Lenin’s methods and thoroughness in preparing his works.
The plans of unfinished or unwritten articles, and plans for speeches and lectures which either have not been recorded, or of which a record no longer exists, are of great importance, because some of them contain vital theoretical propositions and characterise the Party’s tasks.
This volume contains 47 of Lenin’s works which were first published in the Fifth Russian edition.

PETERSBURG LEAGUE OF STRUGGLE FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASS 1 Mikhailov first put in an appearance at St.
Petersburg in 1891 as a Kharkov student expelled for making trouble.
He entered a student organisation which bore the name of “corporation” 2 even after it fell apart.
There was a rumour at the dental courses about his behaviour during a suspicious acquaintanceship; he was accused of spending money collect-ed for the famine-stricken, but he made good the loss.
At that time, he became intimate with.

* In January 1894, a search was also carried out in the homes of many former members of the said “corporation”, including Mikhailov himself.
At the interrogations, all heard a detailed reading on the membership of the society, etc.
The gendarmes declared that the case arose on the strength of information supplied by a former member.
Mikhailov was cleared of all suspicion by the gendarmes saying that importance had been attached to this trivial case only because an obvious revolutionary was involved in it.
At the same time, a strike took place at the Voronin factory.
3 Mikhailov insinuated himself among them and started to make collections for their benefit.
In February, eight workers who had dealt with Mikhailov and one student who had collected money on his assignment (Talalayev) were arrested.
After that Mikhailov again started to edge closer to the ouvriers ** and managed to penetrate into circles * MS.

4 The latter were arrested in the summer of 1894.
The inquiry revealed that the police had been informed of a great deal.
At the inquiry involving our Stariki there was the charge that they were acquainted with some of these Narodovoltsi, but it happened.
.
.
.
* The first Mikhailov case came to an end soon after * and others were exiled, but he was let off and told everyone that he had petitioned for clemency and that he had done so with the intention of continuing to work on the old lines.
Unfortun-ately, some people failed to regard this fact as being suffi-ciently disgraceful and gave him their patronage, so that he who did not command any personal respect among the workers was given an opportunity to consolidate and extend his ties.
There follows a description of his methods, his pressing of money on workers, his invitations to them to visit him at home, the revelation of Party names, etc.
In this way and because he enjoyed the full confidence of the said persons, he soon discovered the identity of many members of various groups.
They were all arrested.
When a worker .

The author regards as being of primary importance what Marx said (about the two ways) in exceptional circum-stances and in virtually conditional terms.

“Laughter” at the men of the 70s (facing history) shows n o t “only an absolute incapacity for taking the historical standpoint”, it is also evidence of theoretical disparagement of the men of the 70s, as compared with those of the 40s and 60s.

The capitalist mode of production is the economic foundation of contemporary bourgeois society, under which the most important part of the means of production and circulation of products, made in the form of commodities, is the private property of a relatively small class of persons, whereas the majority of the population cannot subsist except by selling their labour-power.
In consequence of this, they find themselves in the dependent condition of wage-workers (proletarians) by their labour creating the income of the owners of the means of production and the circulation of commodities (capi-talists and big landowners).
II.
The sphere of domination of the capitalist mode of production is expanding, as the continuous technical progress increases the eco-nomic importance of the big enterprises and thereby decreases the role of independent small producers in the economic life of society, depress-ing their living standard, displacing some into the ranks of the pro-letariat, and turning others into direct or indirect vassals and trib-utaries of capital.

ing them into the ranks of the propertyless class (the proletariat), which is de-prived of the means of pro-duction.
III.
The most important part of the means of production and the circulation of commodities is increasingly concentrat-ed in the hands of a relatively small class of persons, whereas an ever growing majority of the population are unable to maintain their existence otherwise than by selling their labour-power.
In consequence of this, they find themsel-ves in the dependent condition of wage-workers (proletarians), who by their labour create the income of the owners of the means of production and the circulation of commodities (capitalists and big landowners).
IV.
By increasing the productivity of labour, technical progress enables the capitalists to intensify their exploita-tion of the workers, engendering a relative reduction in the demand for labour-power (that is, the increase in demand is not proportional to [lags behind] the increase in capital) simultaneously with a relative and absolute increase in its supply.
This, together with the above-mentioned basic tendencies of capitalism, leads to a growth of unemployment, poverty exploitation, oppression and degradation.
V.
The condition of the working class and the small producers is even further worsened by the industrial crises, which are the inevitable outcome of the said contradictions of capitalism, by the lack of balanced development of pro-duction, which is intrinsic to it (and which no associations of industrialists can eliminate), and by the growth of rivalry among the capitalist countries on the world market.
Poverty and destitution of the masses exist side by side with a waste of social wealth in consequence of the impos-sibility of finding markets for the commodities produced.

Thus, the gigantic opment of the produc-development of the pro-tive forces of social {Reword} ductive forces of social and increasingly socialised la-labour is attended bour is attendedby the monopolisation of all the principal advantages of this development by a negligible minority of the population, with the growth of social wealth proceeding side by side with the growth of social inequality, with the gulf between the propertied and propertyless, between the class of pro-perty-owners (the bourgeoisie) and the class of the prole-tariat, growing.
VII.
But as all these inevitable contradictions of capi-talism increase and develop, the discontent and indigna-tion of the working class also grow, and its solidari-ty increases, in virtue of the very conditions of the capitalist mode of produc-tion, the number and the solidari-ty of the proletarians, their discontent and indignation grow, the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class becomes sharper and the urge to throw off the intol-erable yoke of capitalism mounts.
VIII.
The emancipation VIII.
The emancipation of of the workers must be an the workers must be an act act of the working class of the working class itself, itself.
If the yoke of capi-because all the other classes talism is to be thrown off, of present-day society stand there must be a social rev-for the preservation of the olution, that is, foundations of the existing economic system.
The real emancipation of the working class requires a social revolution, naturally flowing from the entire de-velopment of the capitalist mode of production, that is, the abolition of private ownership of the means of pro-duction, their conversion into public property and the replacement of the capitalist production of commodities by the socialist organisation of the production of commodities by society as a whole, with the object of ensuring full well-being and free all-round development for all its members.
IX.
To effect this social revolution the proletariat mustwin political power, which will make it master of the situa-tion and enable it to remove all obstacles along the road to its great goal.
In this sense the dictatorship of the proleta-riat is an essential political condition of the social revolution.
X.
The revolution of the proletariat will mean the eman-cipation of all the now oppressed and suffering mankind, because it will put an end to all types of oppression and exploitation of man by man.
XI.
Russian Social-Democracy undertakes the task of disclosing to the workers the irreconcilable antagonism between their interests and those of the capitalists, of explaining to the proletariat the historical significance, nature and prerequisites of the social revolution it will have to carry out, and of organising a revolutionary class party capable of directing the struggle of the proletariat in all its forms against the present social and political system.
XII.
But the development of international exchange and of production for the world market has established (created) such close ties among all the nations of the civilised (?) world, that the great aim of the proletariat’s emancipation struggle can be achieved only through the joint efforts of proletarians in all countries.
That is why * the present-day working-class movement had to become, and has long since become, an international movement, and Russian Social-Democracy regards itself as one of the detachments of the world army of the proletariat, as part of international So-cial-Democracy.
B.
I.
The immediate aims of Russian Social-Democracy are, however, considerably modified by the fact that in our country numerous remnants of the pre-capitalist, serf-owning, social system retard the development of the pro-ductive forces in the highest degree, and lower the working population’s standard of living; they are responsible for the Asiatically barbarous way in which the many-million-strong peasantry is dying out, and keep the entire people * The words “the great aim of the proletariat’s emancipation struggle can be achieved only through the joint efforts of proletarians in all countries.
That is why” are crossed out in the MS.
—Ed.
in a state of ignorance and subjection, denying them all rights.
The Russian Social-Democrats still have to work for the free civic and political institutions which already exist in the leading capitalist countries and which are undoubtedly necessary for the full and all-round development of the proletariat’s class struggle against the bourgeoisie.
* II.
The most outstanding of these remnants of the serf-owning system and the most formidable bulwark of all that barbarism and all the calamities of which the politically free countries are already rid, is the tsarist autocracy; it is the bitterest and most dangerous enemy of the proletarian emanci-pation movement.
The tsarist autocracy is the most outstanding of these remnants of the serf-owning system and the most formi-dable bulwark of all this barbarism.
It is the bitterest and most dangerous enemy of the proletarian emancipa-tion movement and the cul-tural development of the entire people.
For these reasons Russian Social-Democracy advances as its immediate political task the overthrow of the tsarist autocracy and its replacement by a republic based on a democratic constitution that would ensure: 1) the people’s sovereignty, that is.

A growing majority of the population are unable to main-tain their existence otherwise than by selling their labour-power.
In consequence of this they find themselves in the con-dition of wage-workers (proletarians) dependent on a relatively small class of capitalists and big landowners, who hold the most important part of the means of production and circu-lation of commodities.

The most important part of the means of production is becoming concentrated in the hands of an insignificant minority of capitalists and big landowners as their private property.
Ever greater numbers of working men losing their means of production are forced to resort to the sale of their labour-power.
In this way they find themselves in the depend-ent condition of wage-workers (proletarians), who by their labour create the income of the property-owners.
The development of capitalism is increasing the number, size and economic importance of the big enterprises, and is depressing the living standard of the independent small producers (peasants, artisans, handicraftsmen), turning some of them into vassals and tributaries of capital and displac-ing others into the ranks of the proletariat.
The higher the level of technical progress, the more the growth of the demand for labour-power lags behind the growth of its supply, and the greater are the opportunities for the capitalists to intensify exploitation of the workers.
The growth of poverty, unemployment, exploitation, oppression and humiliation is the result of the basic tendencies of capitalism.
Insecurity of existence, un-employment, the yoke of ex-ploitation and humiliation of every kind are becoming the lot of ever wider sections of the working population.
This process is still more aggravated by industrial crises, which are the inevitable outcome of the said contradictions of capitalism.
Poverty and destitution of the masses exist side by side with a waste of social wealth in consequence of the im-possibility of finding markets for the commodities produced.
Thus, the gigantic development of the productive forces of social and increasingly socialised labour is attended by monopolisation of all the principal advantages of this development by a negligible minority of the population.
The growth of social wealth proceeds side by side with the growth of social inequality; the gulf between the class of property-owners (the bourgeoisie) and the class of the proletariat is growing.

Small-scale production is being ousted to an ever greater degree by large-scale production.
The independ-ent small producers (peasants, artisans and handicraftsmen)are being turned either into proletarians or vassals and tributaries of capital.
As the result of continuous technical progress small-scale production is being ousted to an ever greater degree by large-scale production.
The most important part of the means of production (of the land and factories, tools and machinery, railways and other means of communication) is becoming concentrated in the hands of a relatively insignificant number of capitalists and big landowners as their private property.
The independent small producers (peasants, artisans and handicraftsmen) are being ruined in growing numbers, losing their means of production and thus turning into proletarians or else becoming servants and tributaries of capital.
Increasing numbers of working people are com-pelled to sell their labour-power.
In this way they become wage-workers who are de-pendent on the property-owners and by their labour create the wealth of the latter.
These wage-workers (pro-letarians) thus find themsel-ves in a condition of depen-dence on the property-owners, and by their labour create the income of the latter.

I also propose a vote on my proposal to delete the author’s considerations about Russian feu-dalism.
Motive: such reasoning is irrelevant in a general, you might say, editorial, article.
The author’s reservations merely suggest a difference of opinion on the Editorial Board.

I already spoke out in this vein above.
A bit of tact would suggest to the author of the remarks that it is highly improper to insist on a v o t e of the stylistic changes he proposes (perhaps for the worse?).
It is equally ridicu-lous to fear that over the minor question of “feudal-ism” (the Martynovs?) will raise a cry about a “difference of opinion”.
My statement was a very general one.
“ ‘Our movement’ is the Social-Democratic labour move-ment.
The peasant masses cannot just be ‘brought’ into it: that is not problematic, but impossible, and there was never any question of it.
However, the peasant masses cannot but be brought into the ‘movement’ against all the remnants of the serf-owning system (including the autoc-racy).

I advise the delation of the words: we must spread the idea that only in a republic can the decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie take place (I request a vote on this).
I am not at all sure that in Britain, say political development must go through a republic.
The mon-archy there will hardly be a hind-rance to the workers, so that its removal may turn out to be a result instead of a preliminary condition of the triumph of social-ism.
A x e l r o d .
In favour of the proposal.
P.
A.
The example of Britain is not very apt because of her exceptional position.
To compare Russia with Britain just now is to sow great confusion among the public.
The “necessity” of a repub-lic is indicated by the remarks of Marx (1875) and Engels (1891) concerning the demand for a republic in Germany 17 — but there can always be exceptions.
“Hence, for the sake of simplicity, the entire content of Clause 4 may be briefly expressed as ‘restitution of the cut-off lands’.
The question arises: how did the idea of this demand originate? It arose as the direct outcome of the general and fundamental proposition that we must assist the peasants and urge them to destroy all remnants of the serf-owning system as completely as possible.
This meets with ‘general approval’, doesn’t it? Well then, if you do agree to follow this road, make an effort to proceed along it independently; don’t make it necessary to drag you; don’t let the ‘unusual’ appearance of this road frighten you; * See present edition, Vol.

don’t be put out by the fact that in many places you will find no beaten track at all, and that you will have to crawl along the edge of precipices, break your way through thickets, and leap across chasms.
Don’t complain of the poor road: these complaints will be futile whining, for you should have known in advance that you would be moving, not along a highway that has been graded and levelled by all the forces of social progress, but along paths, through out-of-the-way places and back-alleys which do have a way out, but from which you, we or anyone else will never find a direct, simple, and easy way out — ‘never’, i.
e.
, whilst these disappearing, but so slowly disappearing, out-of-the-way places and back-alleys continue to exist.
“But if you do not want to stray into these back-alleys, then say so frankly and don’t try to get away by phrase-mongering.
” * P l e k h a n o v .
I put to the vote the question of crossing out this page.
It lends a somewhat feuilleton character to the reason-ing, which in itself is clear and consistent.
In order to put forward the demand for resti-tution of the cut-off lands, there is no need “to crawl along the edge of precipices”, etc.
This imagery suggests that the author himself has not quite tied in the “cut-off lands” with his own orthodoxy.
A x e l r o d.
I propose we leave out this page, starting from the words: “This meets.
.
.
” to the end of the following page (47).
P.
A.
I put to the vote the question of whether it is proper to use such cancan-toned remarks in respect of a colleague.
And where is it going to get us if we a l l start cudgelling each other in that way? ? “Direct survivals of the corvée system, recorded times without number in all the economic surveys of Russia, are maintained, not by any special law which protects them, but by the actually existing land relationships.
This is so to such an extent that witnesses testifying before the well-known Valuyev Commission 18 openly stated that serf-ownership would undoubtedly have been revived had it not * See present edition, Vol.
6, p.
127.
—Ed.
been directly prohibited by law.
Hence, one of two things: either you refrain altogether from touching upon the land relationships between the peasants and the landlords — in which case all the remaining questions are solved very ‘simply’, but then you will also be ignoring the main source of all the survivals of the serf-owning economy in the country-side, and will ‘simply’ be avoiding a burning question bearing on the most vital interests of the feudal landlords and the enslaved peasantry, a question which tomorrow or the day after may easily become one of the most pressing social and political issues in Russia.
Or else you want also to touch upon the source of the ‘obsolete forms of economic bondage’ represented by the land relationships — in which case you must reckon with the fact that these relationships are so complex and entangled that they do not actually permit of any easy or simple solution.
Then, if you are not satisfied with the concrete solution we have proposed for this complex question, you no longer have the right to get away with a general ‘complaint’ about its complexity, but must attempt to cope with it independently, and propose some other concrete solution.
“The importance of the cut-off lands in present-day peasant farming is a question of reality.
” * P l e k h a n o v .
I would advise throwing out all the reasoning about “simplicity” and “non-simplicity”, and continuing the article with the words: “The im-portance of the cut-off lands.
.
.
.
” The article will gain therefrom, because this whole passage spoils it by being terribly ( ?? ) dragged out.
I propose a vote.
The reasoning about sim-plicity, as a summing up of the foregoing (and as a reply to a host of remarks made by those even who sympathise with us), is not at all super-fluous, and I suggest we leave it in.
“Labour rent makes for stagnation in cultivation tech-niques and for stagnation in all social and economic relation-ships in the countryside, since this labour rent hampers the development of a money economy and the differentiation of the peasantry, disembarrasses the landlord (comparatively) of the stimulus of competition (instead of raising the techni-cal level, he reduces the share of the sharecropper; incidental-* See present edition, Vol.

—Ed.
ly, this reduction has been recorded in a number of localities for many years of the post-Reform period), ties the peasant to the land, thereby checking the progress of migration, outside employment, etc.
”* P l e k h a n o v .
I propose to delete the words: “and the differ-entiation of the peasantry”; they could bias the reader against a measure which in itself merits every approval.
If you insist on leaving these words in, elabo-rate on them, explaining (even if only in a footnote) what you mean by them.
I request a vote.
Furthermore: what means “comparatively disembarrasses”? The word “comparatively” does not fit in here.
How? Whom> Why? — this baffles all understanding.
It’s quite plain.
It means: it disembarrasses relative to the current state in Russia (and not as compared with, say, America).
“And in general: once it is generally acknowledged that the cut-off lands are one of the principal roots of the labour-rent system — and this system is a direct survival of serf-ownership which retards the development of capitalism — how can one doubt that the restitution of the cut-off lands will undermine the labour-rent system and accelerate social and economic progress?”** P l e k h a n o v .
That is just why there is no need to go to such lengths to prove this.
A hasty conclusion.
See end of this (55) and begin-ning of the next page.
*** “As far as I can judge, all objections ‘against the cut-off lands’ fit into one or another of these four groups; moreover, most of the objectors (including Martynov) have answered all four questions in the negative, considering the demand for the restitution of the cut-off lands wrong in principle, politically inexpedient, practically unattainable, and logi-cally inconsistent.

What you want is to accelerate the elimination of serf-owning by a measure which in essence amounts to the splitting-up (partial, but nevertheless splitting-up) of large-scale farms.
Are you not thereby sacrificing the inter-ests of the future to the interests of the present? For the sake of the problematic possibility of a peasant revolt against serf-owning in the immediate future, you are placing obstacles in the way of a revolt of the agricultural proletariat against capitalism in the more or less distant future!’ “This argument, however convincing it may seem at first glance, is very one-sided.

I think it is ridiculous to see this as a “compliment to our opponents”, when they are being refuted (this is even actually wrong, because the argument was repeated in their letters by Iskra’s closest friends).

“And in order to facilitate for our farm labourers and semi-farm labourers the subsequent transition to socialism, it is highly important that the socialist party begin to ‘stand up’ at once for the small peasants, and do ‘everything possible ’ for them, never refusing a hand in solving the * See present edition, Vol.

urgent and complex ‘alien’ (non-proletarian) problems, and helping the working and exploited masses to regard the socialist party as their leader and representative.
” * P l e k h a n o v .
Why are the words “everything possible” in inverted commas ( “ quotes”)? I don’t understand.
Besides, the question of “semi-farm labour-ers” is not at all an alien one for the proletariat.
It is now extremely bad policy to use this word, even in quotes.
Is it so hard to understand that everyone has his own way of using quotes? Perhaps the author of the remarks will want to “v o t e ” on the quotes as well? I shouldn’t be at all surprised! “It is the Russian bourgeoisie who were ‘late’ with what is really their task of sweeping away all the remnants of the old regime, and we must and shall rectify this omission until it has been rectified, until we have won political liberty, as long as the position of the peasants continues to foster dissatisfaction among practically the whole of educated bourgeois society (as is the case in Russia), instead of fostering a feeling of conservative self-satisfaction among it on account of the ‘indestructibility’ of what is supposed to be the strongest bulwark against socialism (as is the case in the West where this self-satisfaction is displayed by all the parties of Order, ranging from the agrarians and conser-vatives pur sang, through the liberal and free-thinking bourgeois, to even as far — without offence to Messrs.

Above you gave an excellent definition of the social-revolutionary character of the agrarian programme; besides nationalisation of the land is now anti-revolutionary even as a slo-gan for an uprising.
I agree with Berg’s proposal.
It’s a pity the “adherent” quite forgot that the remark related to the unedited ar-ticle.
Just a little attention would have spared him this amusing mistake.
“But our present programme is being drawn up, not only for the period of revolutionary insurrection, not even so much for that period, as for the period of political slavery, for the period that precedes political liberty.
However, in this period the demand for the nationalisation of the land is much less expressive of the immediate tasks of the demo-cratic movement in the meaning of a struggle against the serf-owning system.
”** P l e k h a n o v.
The point made above was that our agra-rian programme is a social-re-volutionary one.
Nationalisation of the land in a police state would mean a fresh and vast increase of that state.
That is why it is not right to say, as the author says here, “much less expressive”, etc.
One measure is revolutionary and the other reactionary.

It would be bet-ter to worry less about the author of a signed article expressing himself in his own manner.
“That is why we think that, on the basis of the present social system, the maximum demand in our agrarian prog-ramme should not go beyond the democratic revision of the Peasant Reform.
The demand for nationalisation of the land, while quite valid in principle and quite suitable at certain moments, is politically inexpedient at the present moment.

it is well known that in our countryside rent is more often of a serf-owning than a bourgeois nature; it is much more “money” rent (i.
e.
, a modified form of feudal rent) than capitalist rent (i.
e.
, the surplus over and above the profit of the employer).
Reductions of rent would therefore directly help to replace serf-owning forms of farming by capitalist forms.
”* P l e k h a n o v .
The author promised not to speak of Russian feudalism (see above), but has failed to keep his promise.
That’s a pity.
I request a vote on the proposal to delete here the word feudal (rent).
That’s not true.
If you do take a look above, you will find that the author “prom-ised” nothing of the sort.
Once the author has made the specific reservation that this is not a general opinion, the quibbling here is doubly tactless.
“Even the autocracy has therefore been obliged more and more frequently to institute a special fund (utterly trifling, of course, and going more to line the pockets of embezzlers of state property and bureaucrats than for the relief of the famine-stricken) ‘for the cultural and charitable needs of the village communes’.
We, too, cannot but demand, among other democratic reforms, that such a fund be established.
That can scarcely be disputed.
” ** P l e k h a n o v .
This passage here about the “autocracy” is extremely inappropriate.
After all, why should we look to it for example? As if we are unable to make any proposals without looking to it for a cue? The restitution to the peasants should be motivated by it being a revolutionary measure, recti-fying an “injustice” which is not only still in everyone’s mind, but which largely served to ruin the Russian peasant (cf.
Martynov).

They had a better understanding of the class struggle.
I propose a vote on the pro-posal to rewrite this passage.

“But, then — the objection is raised — this tribute cannot be returned in full.
Quite so (just as the cut-off lands cannot be restituted in full).
”* P l e k h a n o v.
Why can’t the cut-off lands be restituted in full? The programme says nothing about it.
I call everyone’s attention to the fact that the meaning of the paragraph we adopted has been changed here.
A x e l r o d.
Why do you restrict and weaken a princi-pled decision by an insertion? That’s absolutely wrong.
Lenin’s insertion in his ar-ticle does not alter the mean-ing of what the programme says, and c a n n o t do so.
The author of the remarks has forgotten the elementary truth that “it is the law, and not the motives of the law, that is subject to applica-tion”.
“Actually, of course, the annulment of collective liability (Mr.
Witte may manage to put this particular reform through before the revolution), the abolition of division into social-estates, freedom of movement, and the right for each individ-ual peasant freely to dispose of his land will rapidly and inevitably bring about the removal of the burden of taxation and serf-bondage that the land commune to a three-fourths extent constitutes at the present time.
But this result will only prove the correctness of our views on the village commune, prove how incompatible it is with the entire social and economic development of capitalism.
” ** P l e k h a n o v.
There is now talk of its destruction.
The rele-vant phrase should therefore be changed.
“Therefore” has nothing to do with it.

time, and even if it does lead to some action, still nothing need be altered there.
I find this fear of “dema-gogy” absolutely unwarrant-ed, because these gentlemen will always come up with similarly “bad criticism”.
“To this we reply that it does not at all follow from our formulation that every peasant must necessarily demand that a separate plot of land be allotted to him.
What does follow is only liberty to sell the land; moreover, the prefe-rential right of the commune members to purchase land that is being sold does not run counter to this liberty.
” * P l e k h a n o v.
I quite agree with this remark, 25 and propose that it be put to the vote.
A x e l r o d.
In favour.
“I agree” with what related to a deleted passage??!!?? A very fine proposal for a “vote ” , indeed! “This objection would be groundless.
Our demands do not destroy the association but, on the contrary, set up in place of the archaic (de facto semi-feudal) power of the commune over the muzhik, the power of a modern associa-tion over its members who join of their own accord.
Nor, in particular, is our formulation at variance with the recogni-tion, for instance, of fellow members’ having the pre-emptive right, on certain terms, to buy the land put up for sale by a fellow member.
” P l e k h a n o v.
I don’t agree with this.
This right would merely depreciate the peasant’s land.
As for collective liability, it has partially already been abol-ished, and the rest will be abol-ished by Mr.
Witte any day now.
Contradiction.
I fail to under-stand: on the one hand, I freely enter an association and freely withdraw from it.
On the other, The author of the remarks overdoes his hostility to the commune.
On this point great care must be taken to keep out of the embrace of Messrs.
A.
Skvortsov & Co.
(into which the author of the remarks falls).
On cer-tain terms, the right of pre-emption may increase instead * See present edition, Vol.

the commune has a pre-emptive right to buy my land.
There’s a contradiction in this.
of decreasing the value of the land.
My expression is de-liberately broader and more general, whereas the author of the remarks is in too much of a hurry to cut the Gordian knot.
By carelessly “deny-ing” the commune (as an association) we may easily spoil all our “good will” to the peasant.
After all, the commune is also connect-ed with the conventional type of settlement, and so on, and only the A.
Skvortsovs “remake” this in their proj-ects with the stroke of a pen.
“To clear the way for the free development of the class struggle in the countryside, it is necessary to remove all remnants of serfdom, which now overlie the beginnings of capitalist antagonisms among the rural population, and keep them from developing.
” * P l e k h a n o v .
This is the The author of the remarks first time I see the word antago-should not imagine that he nism used in the plural.
is past seeing anything for the first time.
* * * This alone is made fully clear by the remarks of the “author of the remarks”.
If he set himself the task of making it i m p o s s i b l e for comrades who disagree with him, even on trifling matters, to work together with him on the board, he is rapidly and very surely moving towards that noble goal.
But if he does reach it, he himself should bear the consequences.
(1) The remarks are written in such a careless manner that no effort has even been made to compare what there was before and what there is after the corrections.
* See present edition, Vol.
6, p.
146.
—Ed.
(2) In fact, the list of corrections has simply been thrown out! “Don’t buck me.
” (3) Hardly any of the a l t e r a t i o n s proposed by the author of the remarks has been formulated by him personally — c o n t r a r y t o t h e s p e c i f i e d c o n -d i t i o n adopted of necessity to avoid intolerable delays.
(4) The tone of the remarks is deliberately abusive.
If I adopted such a tone in “analysing” Plekhanov’s article on the programme (i.
e.
, his personal “a r t i c l e ” and not the draft of a general statement, a general programme, etc.
) that would at once be the end of our collaboration.
And so I “put to the vote”: are members of the board to be allowed to provoke other members into doing so? (5) It is the summit of tactlessness to use v o t i n g s to interfere in the very manner in which the members of the board express themselves.
The author of the remarks puts me in mind of a coachman who thinks that to steer well, the horses have to be reined in and brought up as often and as hard as possible.
Of course, I am nothing more than a horse, one of the horses of the coachman — Plekhanov — but even the most harassed horse may throw off the much too spirited coachman.

“TO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA” 26 We give in full the splendid proclamation issued by the Don Committee of our Party.
It shows that the Social-Democrats know how to appreciate the heroic behaviour of men like Balmashev, without, however, falling into the error of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
27 The Social-Demo-crats bring to the fore the workers’ (and peasants’) movement.
They make their demands on the government on behalf of the working class and the whole people, but without issuing any threats of further attempts and assassinations.
Theyregard terrorism as one of the possible ancillary means, and not as a special tactical method justifying separation from revolutionary Social-Democracy.

The national question is a part of the programme and is to be dealt with when the latter is discussed.
The question of regional and national organisations in general is an organisational one.
But the question of attitude to the nationalities, in particular, is a tactical question and is an application of our general principles to practical activity.

The sixth relates to the Party organisation.
Upon the establishment of general rules for local, regional, national and other organisations, this special question is raised: which organisations and on what terms shall be recruited to the Party? Printed from the text of the book Vtoroi ocherednoi syezd R.

66 The reports during the debates pointed out that the draft deliberately says “will work for ” in order to emphasise that we do not intend to do this now but in the future.
I motion this amendment to avoid giving ground for such misunderstandings.
By the words “above all ” I mean that we have other demands, apart from the agrarian programme.
2 I object to Comrade Lyadov’s proposal.
67 We are not drafting a law, but are merely giving general indications.
There are those among the townsfolk who also belong to the poll-tax paying estates; in addition, there are the small tradesmen in the suburbs and others, and if we were to write all this into our programme we should have to use the idiom of Volume IX of the Code of Laws.
3 I find Martynov’s question superfluous.
68 Instead of putting forward general principles we are being forced into particulars.
If we were to do so, we should never come to the end of the Congress.
The principle is quite definite: every peasant has the right to dispose of his land, whether belonging to the commune or held as private property.
That is nothing but the demand of the peasant’s right to dispose of his land.
We insist that there should be no special laws for the peasant; we want more than the right of withdrawing from the commune.
We are unable just now to decide on all the particulars that may crop up in implementing this.
I am against Comrade Lange’s addendum; we cannot demand the abolition of all the laws governing tenure.
That is going too far.
4 Martynov must be labouring under a misunderstanding.
What we want is uniform application of general legislation, the one now accepted in all the bourgeois states, namely, that which is based on the principles of Roman law and which recognises both personal and common property.
We should like to regard communal land-holdings as common prop-erty.
5 We are engaged in the drafting of addenda to § 4 in respect of the Caucasus.
These addenda should be inserted after point a).
There are two draft resolutions.
If we adopt Comrade Karsky’s amendment, the point will lose heavily in concreteness.
In the Urals, for instance, there is a hostof survivals; over there, there is a veritable reservation of serfdom.
Concerning the Latvians we could say that they fit the formula: “and in other regions of the state”.
I support Comrade Kostrov’s proposal, namely: we must insert a demand for the transfer of land titles to the khizani, the temporarily bound and others.
69 6 Paragraph 5 is connected with paragraph 16 of the labour programme: this does imply courts consisting equally of workers and employers; we must demand special representa-tion for the farm labourers and the poor peasantry.
70 7 I believe this to be unnecessary, since it would extend the competence of the courts out of all proportion.
71 Our aim is to secure a reduction of rents, but the establishment of tariffs would enable the landowners to argue their case by referring to definite facts.
The reduction of rent-prices rules out any idea of their increase.
Kautsky, speaking of Ireland, said that some results were obtained there by the introduction of industrial courts.

72 The Council, however, must be not only an arbitral institution, but also one co-ordinating the activity of the C.
C.
and the Central Organ.
He also speaks out in favour of the Congress appointing a fifth member.
It may well happen that the four members of the Council will be unable to elect a fifth; we shall then find ourselves without a necessary institution.
2 L e n i n finds Comrade Zasulich’s arguments unsatis-factory.
73 The case she described already implies struggle; in that case the Rules will be of no help.
By leaving the election of the fifth member to the four members of the Council, we introduce struggle into the Rules.
He considers it necessary to note that the Council is more than a recon-ciliation body.
Thus, for instance, under the Rules, two members of the Council have the right to convene it.
3 L e n i n favours the retention of this phrase; no one should be barred from taking his appeal to the centre.
That is a necessary condition of centralisation.
74 4 75 There are two questions here.
The first is about the quali-fied majority, and I object to the proposal to reduce it from four-fifths down to two-thirds.
Introduction of a motivated protest would show lack of foresight and I object to it.
76 The second question is immensely more important — the right of mutual control over co-optation by the C.
C.
and the Central Organ.
The mutual accord of the two centres is a necessary condition of harmony.
This is a question of a break between the two centres.
Those who do not want a split must see to it that there is harmony.
We know from the life of the Partythat there have been people who introduced splits.
This is a question of principle; it is an important question and the whole of the Party’s future may depend on it.
5 The Rules may have been lame in one leg, now Comrade Yegorov makes them lame in both.
77 The Council is to co-opt only in exceptional cases.
Complete confidence is necessary for both sides, for both centres, just because this is a complex mechanism.
There can be no successful work together without full mutual trust.
And the entire question of correct functioning together is closely bound up with the right of co-optation.
Comrade Deutsch is wrong in exaggerating the technical difficulties.

Polny tekst protokolov, Central Committee publication, Geneva, 1 9 0 4 Printed from the text of the book 14 SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE PARTY RULES AUGUST 5 (18) 1 Let me reply briefly to both objections.
78 Comrade Martov says that I propose the unanimity of the two collegiums in co-opting members; that is not right.
The Congress has decided not to give the right of veto to each member of two, possibly rather extensive, collegiums, but that does notmean that we cannot vest this authority in the institution co-ordinating all the joint work of the two centres.
The joint work of the two centres demands complete unanimity and even personal unity, and that is possible only if co-optation is unanimous.
After all, if two members find co-optation necessary, they are entitled to convene the Council.
2 Martov’s amendment contradicts the already adopted point on the unanimous co-optation to the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
79 3 Comrade Martov’s interpretation is wrong, because the exemption contradicts unanimity.
80 I appeal to the Congress and request it to decide whether Comrade Martov’s amend-ment should be put to the vote.
4 I should not argue with Comrades Glebov and Deutsch in substance, but I considered it necessary to mention the League 81 in the Rules, first, because everyone knew of the League’s existence, second, to make note of the League’s representation in the Party under the old rules, and third, because all other organisations have the status of commit-tees, whereas the League is introduced to bring out its special status.

As for the minutes, the Congress in any case offers them the opportunity to attend the special sitting to approve the minutes.
Written on August 5 (1 8 ), 1 9 0 3 First published in 1 9 2 7 in Lenin Miscellany VI Printed from the original 16 SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE STATEMENT BY MARTYNOV AND AKIMOV AUGUST 5 (18) 1 The bureau has discussed the statement by Com-rades Martynov and Akimov which they filed at the morning sitting.
I shall not go into the motivation, although it is wrong and extremely strange.
No one has ever declared the Union 84 closed and Comrades Martynov and Akimov made an incorrect inference from the Congress decision on the League.
But even the closure of the Union could not deprive delegates of the right to participate in the work of the Con-gress.
Similarly, the Congress cannot allow any refusal to take part in the voting.
A member of the Congress is not free merely to approve the minutes without taking part in the rest of its work.
For the time being, the bureau does not propose any resolution and refers this question for debate at the Congress.
The statement by Martynov and Akimov is extremely abnormal and contradicts the status of member of the Congress.
2 What an absurd and abnormal situation we now have.
On the one hand, we are told that the decisions of the Congress are being accepted, and on the other, there is the intention to withdraw over a decision on the Rules.
By arriving here as a delegate of an organisation recognised by the Organising Committee, each one of us has become a member of the Congress.
This title is not abolished by the dissolution of an organisation.
What are we, the bureau, to do during the voting? We cannot simply omit those whohave left, because the Congress has already approved its constitution.
There is one logical conclusion that suggests itself: withdrawal from the ranks of the Party altogether.
The minutes may be approved with comrades of the Union being specially invited to attend, although the Congress is entitled to approve its minutes even without them.

Polny tekst protokolov, Central Committee publication, Geneva, 1 9 0 4 Printed from the text of the book THE LAW ON COMPENSATION PAYABLE TO WORKERS INJURED IN ACCIDENTS The recent new law, the substance of which is stated in the title of the article, and the law on shop-stewards, which we analysed in the previous issue, * are rather typical specimens of the two trends in our labour legislation expres-sive of this or that concession to the spirit of the times.
Apart from the aggressive reactionary laws of which we have a great abundance and which manage to pass through all the bureaucratic ordeals with especial rapidity, and which are moreover drawn up with especial thoroughness and applied with especial vigour, all the other laws in Russia relating to the working class may be classified under two heads, depending on their political character.
These are either laws which in any way, even by a hair’s breadth, extend the workers’ independence, initiative and rights, in which case the laws are hedged with hundreds and thousands of exemptions, reservations, circular-letter explanations * See present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
508-15.
—Ed.
and restrictions, all of which lead — as our draft programme puts it — to the “extension or consolidation of tutelage of the working classes by the police and officials”.
Such are the laws on shop-stewards, factory inspection in general, etc.
Or these are laws expressing a concession which has no bearing on citizens’ independence and initiative — in which case the autocratic government comes forward with incomparably greater generosity.
And that is how it should be, of course, from the standpoint of the autocracy’s general tactics, from the standpoint of police interests, “correctly construed”.
The policy of the police state has long been called that of the whip and carrot by West-European democrats, who have had all sorts of experience in fighting it.
The carrot is the sops to the revolutionary classes, the economic concessions designed to sow discord within these classes, to win over a section of them and make it believe in the bourgeois government’s sincerity and friendly attitude to the proletariat.
The whip is the police harassment of all those who have no trust in the government and sow mistrust among others; the whip is keeping in check all those who want complete freedom and independence for the working class, for its unions, for its meetings, for its newspapers, and for its political institutions and organs.
The law on shop-stewards gives the workers representa-tion which could serve them against the bourgeoisie and the government.
Accordingly, the representation is so distorted and restricted as to enable only, or at any rate mainly, spies to benefit from it.
Accordingly, in actual fact, what remains of workers’ representation, as proclaimed by the law, is the collar, as in the case of Trishka’s caftan.
And that is needed to collar the ill-starred shop-steward and drag him off to the police station.
On the other hand, the law on compensation for workers does not affect their political initiative in any way and, consequently, on that score there can be greater generosity.
There it is less dan-gerous to act the “reformer” —and the need to act is impera-tive, because the growing labour movement is looming in an ever more formidable manner.
The bureaucratic machine started its work on a bill on employers’ responsibil-ity twenty years ago.
It took ten years to draw up the bill; finally, it was approved by a special commission and in1893 it was promulgated and placed before the State Coun-cil 89 .
.
.
only to be pigeon-holed once again for another ten years! It seemed quite impossible to make haste any slower than that, and the bill would possibly have roamed the ministries and the chancellories for another decade or so had not the onslaught by the working class of Russia shaken up the whole of the autocracy.
Finally, and at long last, the bill, repeatedly worsened in many respects, has become law.
For an assessment, let us compare it with the demand in our draft Party programme: in fact its “labour section” should he a guide in our work of agitation and propaganda.
Nothing but a comparison of the separate points and demands of our programme with pres-ent-day reality and the attempts on the part of the ruling classes to reform it without giving anyone offence, will enable us, on the one hand, to give ourselves and the masses a fuller and more concrete understanding of the meaning and significance of our programme; and on the other, to see the defects of the laws in force; it will also help us to see in practice, from the facts, to what extent any reform is doomed to produce paltry results if the basis of the bour-geois system is retained.
Our draft programme (§7 of the “labour section”) demands that the law should establish the employers’ civil liability in general (for workers’ injuries and disease), which means anyone who employs workers, anyone who derives profit from the unpaid labour of others, making use of their labour-power, but not being held liable for the destruction or damage of this commodity (labour-power) when in opera-tion.
However, the new law relates exclusively to workers and employees “in enterprises of the factory and works, mining and metallurgical industries”.
Consequently, all agricultural workers, handicraftsmen, builders, artisans and so on and so forth are excluded.
This means the exclusion of the vast majority of wage-labourers, who often work in even worse and more dangerous conditions; for example, building and agricultural workers operating machines suffer from injuries as much as, if not more than, factory workers.
How is this exemption to be explained? The answer is that outside factories and works the shoe does not yet pinch so badly: so far the labour movement has made a formidableshowing only among the leading sections of the proletariat, and it is only in this sphere that the government has shown “concern” (not for the workers, of course, but for their suppression).
But the proletariat, that part of it which participates in the movement, that is, the class-conscious proletariat, does not struggle for the benefit and advantages of some single section of the workers, but for the whole class, for all the classes oppressed by the capitalist system.
This brings out very well the difference between the reforms which the proletariat seeks, and the reforms which the government hands out as sops.
Furthermore, the new law binds the owners of enterprises to pay compensation to workers only for the loss of capacity for work, “due to bodily injury caused by operations in the production of the enterprise or arising in consequence of such operations”.
Our programme demands the estab-lishment of liability not only for disability caused by accidents, but also by hazardous working conditions.
Conse-quently, once again the new law narrows down the employers’ liability.
Everyone knows that masses of workers are disabled not by accidents alone, not by bodily injury, but by the diseases caused by the hazardous working condi-tions.
Unless the employers are held liable for the workers’ disability through disease, no amount of rules or instruc-tions will do any good in the struggle against these hazardous conditions.
Indeed let us consider what differ-ence there is in substance between the accident in which a machine cuts off a worker’s leg and the case of a worker who is poisoned by phosphorus, lead, dyes, etc.
Has not medical science already created a whole department of occupational diseases whose origins have been traced to hazardous working conditions and proved as surely as twice two is four? However the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois government are not guided by logic or common sense, but by gross self-interest: accidents will cost them less than bodily injuries plus disease arising from hazardous conditions.
And the whole point, for them, is not to “provide security” for the workers but to pay less.
The new law releases the worker from the onus of proving that the disability has occurred through the fault of the capitalist.
That is undoubtedly a step forward from the past.
But — the Russian Government is unable to take a step forward anywhere without a “but”! — but to make up for that, employers may prove not only ill intent on the part of the victim himself, but also “gross carelessness on his (victim’s) part, unwarranted by the dispatch of operations”.
This addition largely paralyses the establishment of real liability and — given the packing of our courts by officials, careerists and bourgeois pedants — can paralyse the applica-tion of the law altogether.
“Gross carelessness” is something quite vague and indefinable.
It is entirely up to the officials to decide in what conditions and to what extent gross carelessness is or is not warranted.
The capitalists have always regarded and will always regard any “carelessness” on the worker’s part as gross and unwarranted, and will always he able to muster ten times more witnesses and “learned counsel” than the workers to prove their point (legal counsel are already being paid annual fees by the factories!).
The writing of this whole point on gross careless-ness into the law is a crass concession to the manufacturer’s profit urge: the workers never get caught in the machine by preference, but always by mishap, but the fact is that you can’t be careful when working ten or eleven hours a day among badly screened machines, in poorly lit shops, amid the din and roar, with your wits dulled by the work, and with your nerves on edge because of excessive tension.
That being so, to deprive a disabled worker of compensation because of gross carelessness to penalise him additionally for permitting the capitalists their unscrupulous exploita-tion.
These points provide the basic and most important defi-nitions of the new law, fully delineating its essence.
We cannot, of course, deal here with all the particulars, but let us look only at the most characteristic ones.
The amount of the compensation is determined in proportion to the victim’s annual earnings, namely, the pension must not be in excess of two-thirds of his annual earnings (in the event of death or total disability).
The annual earnings are determined on the basis of the average daily wage (or the average daily wage of an unskilled worker) multiplied by 260.
This provision contains another three reductions in the size of compensation, three endorsements of theemployers’ profit urge.
First, even if the worker has worked 300 days in the year, his annual earnings are cut down to 260 days — without any grounds, simply because the law commands that they should be cut! Second, even if the worker has been earning more than an unskilled worker, the calculation — involving work, say, at enterprises running part of the year — is still based on the earnings of an un-skilled worker.
The government would very much like to re-duce all workers to the status of unskilled workers — hence the lesson for the class-conscious proletariat, that only the close unity of all workers and all unskilled workers together can create a force capable of overcoming capital’s profit urge.
Third, the unskilled worker’s average daily wage is determined once in three years (sic!) by the offices for factory, mining and metallurgical affairs, without, need we say, any of the workers participating.
That is not their business, for who can doubt that the chancellories of the governor and the chief of gendarmes have an excellent knowledge of how the workers live and what they earn.
Let us note, too, that the law binds the owners of enter-prises to notify the police immediately only about accidents which fall within the compass of the law.
Which are they? They are those involving disability for more than three days.
But who can tell just after an accident for how many days the worker has been disabled? This rule is ridiculously absurd and in many cases merely provides the manu-facturers with a loophole for divesting themselves (and being divested by the courts) of the duty of informing the authorities of every accident.
It is true that the law decrees that the victim may demand notification of the police of all cases of bodily injury without exception, even where they do not fall under the law: that is said in so many words in §20, of the “rules on compensation payable to injured work-ers”, and we strongly advise all workers to campaign in every way for the constant application of this paragraph without fail.
Let the workers insist that everyone injured should always demand unconditionally, on the strength of § 20, that the factory inspector be notified of every accident; only then will it be possible to determine to any precise extent the number of accidents occurring and to study their causes.
We are sure that the class-consciousworkers will make use of this right, but then great masses will not even be aware that such a right is open to them! For failure to notify the police of accidents and in general for any failure to observe the rules of the new law the owners of enterprises are subject only to a cash fine of from 25 to 100 rubles.
That is, of course, an absolutely negligible fine, which is not at all a dreadful one for the large factories (which employ the vast majority of factory workers).
This case makes especially clear the necessity of implementing § 14 of our draft programme, which demands “the establishment of criminal responsibility for employers for breaches of labour protection laws”.
It is a mockery of the worker to threaten millionaires with 100-ruble fines for non-observance of a law on which depends the security of a worker disabled for life.
Par.
31, which entitles injured workers and their families to enter into agreement with the owners of enterprises concerning the type and amount of compensation payable to them, is one of the most pernicious and Jesuitical points of the new law.
Need we say that the vast majority of these agreements will amount to systematic fraud and intimida-tion of the least developed workers who are sure of only one thing, namely, that Russian courts are biased, bureaucratic and expensive.
Factory inspectors, who are to witness these agreements (equivalent to settlements out of court), will safeguard anyone’s interests but those of the workers.
The factory inspectors, who are now being increasingly turned into mere assistants of the police, play the part of “reconcilers”.
What is more, it is the intention of the law to turn them into a peculiar category of magistrates.
The law encourages employers and workers to apply to factory inspectors in clearing up the rights and duties of the parties, with the factory inspectors being empowered both to collect “all the necessary information” and to demand its submis-sion to the parties, and to invite doctors for certification.
This is already purely judicial business and it is assigned to officials under the governor! What is more, no procedure, no rules governing this court have been laid down: how the inspector is to collect the information, how he is — and is he at all — to submit this information to both parties, how he is to conduct the examination — all that is left entirelyup to him.
This is something positively like the police courts of the pre-Reform period.
The law even holds out the threat of a deprivation for failure to apply to the factory constable (in his capacity as magistrate): those who fail to apply to the factory inspector before going to court, lose their right to receive court and legal costs from the defendant.
It remains for us only to give another reminder at this point that the Social-Democratic Labour Party does not demand courts of that kind, not mediation by officials, but the establishment of industrial courts on which employers and workers are equally represented.
That is the only kind of court, given a free political system in the state, that can assure the workers of anything like satisfactory mediation in the business of elucidating the rights and duties of the parties, and in the preliminary examination of claims involving disability compensation.
There are such courts in all civilised states, and as long as 40 years ago even Russian officials used to propose their introduction in Russia.
Forty years ago, a commission was appointed to revise the factory and handicraft regulations.
The commis-sion has published its “transactions”, five volumes of them; the commission has written the drafts of new regulations; the commission has come out in favour of setting up indus-trial courts consisting of elected representatives — and.
.
.
and the whole thing has been shelved! Heaps of good inten-tions are stacked up in the archives of innumerable offices in Russia, and will continue to be there until the working class gives all this rubbish a shake-up.

Comrade Martov has resigned, and I am now the only authorised delegate.

OCTOBER 13 (26) I did indeed ask the assembly myself, and no one stopped me.
I think that it is quite all right to talk freely about everything.
There is a tremendous difference between pri-vate conversations and the meetings of the Iskra organisa-tion.
At any rate, let the meeting express its views.
I shall not speak of the private meetings of the Iskra organisation until the League finds it necessary for me to do so.

Lenin declares on his own behalf and on behalf of the comrades who voted with him that he regards the rejection of Comrade Konyagin’s resolution and the adoption of Comrade Martov’s resolution as a crying violation of the Party Rules.
96 (“Which paragraph of the Rules specifically does the vote contradict?”) I refuse to answer such questions, because this has been sufficiently well clarified in the course of the debate.
(“State the paragraph of the Rules which the resolution we have adopted contradicts.

REPRESENTATIVES JANUARY 17 (30) A rule has been established in the practice of all congresses in virtue of which those voting have the right to record their minority opinions.
Of course, every minority opinion is essentially a kind of criticism.
But this circumstance did not, after all, prevent the entry at the Second Congress of a minority opinion issued by the Bund represen-tatives, an opinion which was the sharpest kind of criticism levelled at the decision adopted by the Congress.
Our mino-rity opinion gets out the motives for which we opposed Comrade Plekhanov’s proposal and in general our attitude to this proposal.
It is the more necessary to read out this minority opinion because at the end of it there is a motivated statement to the effect that we withdraw our resolution.

January 29, 1904 Published in January 1 9 0 4 together with the appeal by the “Group of Founders” in a separate leaflet “To One and All” Printed from the text of the leaflet TO THE RUSSIAN PROLETARIAT 103 The war is on.
The Japanese have already inflicted a series of defeats on the Russian troops, and the tsarist government is now straining every nerve to avenge itself for these defeats.
Military districts are being mobilised one after another, and tens of thousands of soldiers are being hastily dispatched to the Far East; desperate efforts are being made abroad to secure another loan, and contrac-tors have been promised bonuses running to thousands of rubles a day for accelerating the works required by the war department.
The people’s every fibre is put to the greatest strain because the struggle that has been started is no trifling matter; it is a struggle against a 50-million-strong people who are splendidly armed, splendidly prepared for the war, and who are fighting for the conditions which they believe to be urgently necessary for free national develop-ment.
This is going to be a struggle by a despotic and back-ward government against a people that is politically free and is rapidly progressing in culture.
The war against the sickly Turkey in 1877 and 1878, which exacted such a highprice from the Russian people, was negligible when compared to the war now started.
What in that case is at issue in the life-and-death struggle now being waged by the Russian workers and peasants against the Japanese? The issue is “Yellow Russia”, the issue is Manchuria and Korea, the new lands seized by the Russian Government.
It had promised all the other powers to preserve the inviolability of China, it had promised to return Manchuria to China not later than October 8, 1903, and it had failed to honour its promise.
The tsarist govern-ment had so run away with itself in its policy of military adventures and plunder of its neighbours that it found no strength to go back.
In “Yellow Russia” it has built fortifications and ports, it has laid a railway line and has concentrated tens of thousands of troops.
But how do the Russian people benefit from these new lands whose acquisition has cost so much blood and sacrifice and is bound to cost even more? For the Russian worker and peasant the war holds out the prospect of fresh calam-ities, the loss of a host of human lives, the ruin of a mass of families, and more burdens and taxes.
The Russian army leadership and the tsarist government believe that the war holds out the promise of military glory.
The Russian merchant and the millionaire-industrialist think the war is necessary to secure new marketing outlets for their goods and new ports in an unrestricted ice-free sea for the develop-ment of Russian trade.
You can’t sell much at home to the starving muzhik and the unemployed worker, you must look for marketing outlets in foreign lands! The riches of the Russian bourgeoisie have been created by the impoverish-ment and the ruin of the Russian workers — and so now, in order to multiply these riches, the workers must shed their blood to give the Russian bourgeoisie a free hand in conquering and enslaving the Chinese and the Korean working man.
This criminal war, which holds in store immense calam-ities for the working people, has been engendered by the interests of the greedy bourgeoisie, the interests of capital, which is prepared to sell and ruin its own country in its drive for profit.
This hazardous gamble involving the blood and property of Russian citizens is the result of the policyof a despotic government which tramples all human rights and keeps its people in servitude.
In response to the wild war-cries, in response to the “patriotic” flag-waving by the flunkeys of the money-bag and the lackeys of the police-whip, the class-conscious Social-Democratic proletariat must come forward and demand with tenfold energy: “Down with the autocracy!”, “Let a people’s constituent assembly be convened!” The tsarist government has plunged so deep into this reckless military gamble that it has at stake a great deal too much.
Even in the event of success, the war against Japan threatens total exhaustion of the people’s forces — with the results of the victory being absolutely negligible, for the other powers will prevent Russia from enjoying the fruits of victory as they prevented Japan from doing so in 1895.
104 In the event of defeat, the war will lead above all to the collapse of the entire government system based on pop-ular ignorance and deprivation, on oppression and violence.
They who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind! Long live the fraternal union of the proletarians of all countries fighting for complete liberation from the yoke of international capital! Long live Japanese Social-Democracy protesting against the war! Down with the ignominious and predatory tsarist autocracy!

Furthermore, I don’t quite see the point of Comrade Plekhanov’s insistent proposal of the need for an immediate reply to the Finns.

REPRESENTATION AT THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONGRESS MAY 31 (JUNE 13) 1 I should like to have an explanation as to whether it is convenient to send delegates both from the Council and from the individual organisations.
Are there any similar examples in the practice of other countries at earlier con-gresses? I think this mode of representation is somewhat inconvenient in terms of both principle and practice (from the financial, technical and other standpoints).
Would it not be better for the Council to be represented there in corpore? I don’t see how we could be victimised.
After all, our Party can’t be deprived of its vote! 2 Since Comrade Plekhanov says that we shall not be able to secure the Party’s separate representation at the Congress, while the dispatch of a large number of delegates to the Congress would cost a great deal, and anyhow we shall not be able to match the Bundists in this respect, it would be more dignified if the Council alone represented the Party at the Congress.
3 Moreover, we shall hardly have time to contact all the organisations to obtain their mandates.
126 In view of this, I motion that in case of necessity the Council should, with-out contacting the individual organisations, be empowered to represent each of them separately.

TO RECALL THEIR REPRESENTATIVES THE PARTY COUNCIL JUNE 5 (18) Comrade Martov remarked that he put forward his pro-posal regardless of the concrete cases and merely to avoid conflicts in the future.
That is why I shall not refer to any concrete cases either and if the resolution is designed exclus-ively to lay down a definite rule for the future, I shall not argue against it.
Perhaps it would be better to cut it down and reduce it to the right of the collegium to recall its representatives, deleting the sentence on non-responsibility to the Congress.

’ S R I G H T T O A P P O I N T N E W M E M B E R S JUNE 5 (18) What Martov said was news to me.
128 We have quite definite indications that the minority of the Moscow Committee proposed the co-optation of one of its candidates, without, however, connecting this question with factionaldifferences.
Furthermore, speaking on the substance of the matter, I would consider it more correct and more in the spirit of the Rules to regard every fraction as a unit; nevertheless, this question is so insignificant that I agree to vote for Comrade Martov’s resolution.

P.
JUNE 5 (18) 1 L e n i n joins Glebov in regarding the votes of the Tver and the Riga committees as invalid, 129 and proposes that the organisations should be regarded as existing not since the issue of their proclamations but since their confirmation by the C.
C.
In addition, he says, the reference to the date of the Congress should be deleted from Martov’s resolution.
The rules of the leagues will determine how many votes they are to have at the Congress.
Until their rules are ap-proved, everything should remain as it was at the Second Congress.
For example, the Caucasian League 130 should have six votes.
2 Comrade Martov and I essentially agree on the right of 9 committees in voting on the Congress.
The Baku Commit-tee, I believe, should not have a separate vote because it is a part of the Caucasian League.
Inquiries should be made about all the five leagues and then the relevant decisions adopted.
3 In substance I would have nothing against Comrade Martov’s proposal, but it would be formally wrong.
131 The Congress has not confirmed them and, consequently, they should be subject to the rule that they may vote for oragainst the Congress only after one year.
There is the less reason to discuss this, since the period has almost run out.
But we should be very careful about the Caucasian League: they would be deeply mortified if we gave them only two votes instead of the six they had.
Moreover, I think that Comrade Martov tends to confuse two points (e and f) of § 3 of the Rules, when he proposes that leagues should be given the same status as committees.
Thus, I motion that we postpone the question of the Caucasian League and make inquiries through the C.
C.
4 I join in Comrade Martov’s opinion concerning the Caucasian League.
132 Then there is another juridical question of how the votes of the Council are to be counted in a general count of the votes required for the convocation of a congress.
I think two interpretations would be correct: either, in determining the required number of organisations, to make the count without including the five votes of the Council in the overall total of votes belonging to all the organisa-tions, and then to count each vote of the Council separately; or simply to take one-half of the existing number of organi-sations, without the Council, and to reckon this half as the number required in this case.
I believe that it would be most correct to count each of the Council’s votes sepa-rately.
First published in full in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XV Printed from the minutes 8 SPEECHES ON THE QUESTION OF PUBLISHING THE MINUTES OF THE PARTY COUNCIL SITTINGS JUNE 5 (18) 1 I absolutely disagree with Comrade Martov.
It is desirable to establish for all the sittings of the Council the rule adopted on the minutes of the last sitting.
133 This publica-tion will hardly be impeded by the requirements of secrecy and it would be highly important for Party members toknow what is going on in the Party’s supreme body and the opinions which are held there by both sides.
2 I am very much surprised by Comrade Glebov’s raising the question of the decision taken at the last sitting and his proposal to review it now.
I believe such a review is inadmissible, either formally or morally.
3 No decision on their publication has yet been taken by the C.

Lenin First published in 1 9 5 9 in Vol.
8 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original DRAFT RESOLUTION OF THE MAJORITY’S GENEVA GROUP While by and large subscribing to the Riga Declaration 135 as being a quite correct and principled expression of the views and policy of the Party majority of the SecondCongress, the meeting deems it necessary to take a definite stand on the new step taken by the C.
C.
The meeting voices its deep conviction that the C.
C.
declaration 136 (see Iskra No.
72 137 ) strikes a major blow for clanishness as against the Party principle, and is another betrayal of the interests of the Party as a whole, a fresh attempt to corrupt the Party by introducing hypocrisy into Party relations.
The meeting brands the opposition by an accountable Party organ to the convocation of a Party congress and its statement that any agitation for the congress is harmful as a disgraceful fact not to be found in the records of any dignified workers’ party.
To receive one’s powers at a Party congress from the Party majority and to proclaim this majority’s policy to be a group policy; to speak of peace between the two contending sides and to make a behind-the-scenes deal with the self-styled repre-sentatives abroad of one of the sides; hypocritically to extol the “lofty” stand of one’s opponents of yesterday and to begin reconciliation by dismissing the members and agents of the C.
C.
who dared commit the crime of agitating for a congress — all this is clear evidence that the new C.
C.
in its new policy has decided to join the C.
O.
in treating the Party as a nonentity.
The meeting vigorously condemns this policy of Bonapartism, urges all Party members to fight resolutely against usurpation and hypocrisy, and demands the full publication of the Council’s minutes and all data on the activity of the central bodies which do not have to be withheld for reasons of secrecy.
The meeting calls on all members of the Party sharing the principled views of the majority to support the publish-ing house set up by Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich 138 and to agitate vigorously for the convocation of the Third Congress.

The conclusion of our St.

We advise all committees and organisations of the majority to exercise firmness in removing the disorganisers as soon as possible so as to have a chance to work, instead of engaging in squab-bles.
Written after December 2 2 , 1 9 0 4 (January 4 , 1 9 0 5 ) First published in 1 9 3 4 in Lenin Miscellany XXVI Printed from the original OUTLINE OF THESES FOR AN ARTICLE “HOW THEY DEFEND THEMSELVES” 144 How They Defend Themselves 1) Two replies to Lenin’s pamphlet on The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra” ’s Plan***—the Editorial Board’s and Plekha-nov’s.
This and is also curious (Plekhanov is nominally on the Board), but the distinction between their replies is extremely interesting.
Plekhanov defends an incorrect stand very cleverly and cautiously.
The Editorial Board, not cleverly.
Plekhanov says nothing at all about either 1) Starover’s resolution and its connection with the Iskra plan, or 2) the “higher type of mobilisation”.
Ergo, what Plekhanov passes over in silence is the e s s e n c e of Iskra’s mistake (Starover’s resolution is the beginning of the mistake, its * See present edition, Vol.

starting-point.
The final point — the consideration of the “higher” type).
The Editorial Board emphasises the connection of its stand with Starover’s resolution, and comes out for the idea of the “higher type”.
Both the Editorial Board and Plekhanov make a very weak stand for the talk on panic (clearly retreating and backtracking).
Plekhanov keeps harping on the contradiction between the old and the new Lenin 145 in an effort to prove that the Iskra Editorial Board was acting according to the old Lenin.
Plekhanov tries to create the impression that Lenin is now opposed to demonstrations before the Zemstvo men and is against dictating to them a “positive programme of action”.
This is an absurdity and a distortion.
What were my theses against Iskra? 1) The talk of panic is vulgar and irrelevant.
The Editorial P Reply? Plekhanov on the Tambovites P Board is 146 (ha-ha!) almost being M on the anarchists (where?) M ” robbed: Q Editorial Board’s “obstruction” Q “superfluous”.
2) “Agreements” with the liberals must be determined by the actual common struggle and not by “promises”.

New tasks: γ ) Abundance of storeys has brought up a new section of Party workers, Party members.
Their participation should be formalised.
(1) Information — resolutions — polls — direct ties with the Central Organ.
(2) Elective principle? (3) Indication or selection of candidates for co-optation? 8.
Another and perhaps even more important task: the work of adding new horizontal storeys should be supple-mented by the work of new “vertical”, you might say, ways of influence.
That is: the growth of the movement makes it necessary and possible to supplement this current work on the storeys by the upper storeys addressing the mass in new forms of massive meetings.
“Short meetings” and “mass rallies”, as a natural product of work on many “storeys”, of themselves lead up to that higher form which prevails abroad and will triumph here le lendemain de la révolution, * namely: to the “mass rallies” as the principal means of political influence on the proletariat and its Social-Democratic education.
9.
Of course, this makes the “storeys” equally necessary.
They will (always?) be necessary.
The thing is to “supple-ment” and not to “substitute”.

Written in February-March 1905 First published in 1926 in Lenin Miscellany V Printed from the original RECORD OF SPEECHES AT THE GENEVA BOLSHEVIK CLUB 151 MINUTES OF MARCH 5, 1905 I L e n i n .
Proposes that all the results of the section’s work should be made public — above all that Stepanov should submit his report in writing, and also the minutes.
A general summary of these minutes should be handed over to the Congress; they could provide many practical indications during the work of the Congress.
Stepanov’s report is regrettably much too abstract in character.
If exact conclusions in the form of resolutions are to be made from the reports, they must be more concrete.
With that end in view I propose a poll among comrades in Russiaand abroad, specifying that they should give precise answers to the questions stated (yes, no, so many).
A picture of their work, e.
g.
, the town in which one worked, the questions one decided at meetings, etc.
While the summarised con-clusions could yield something, I repeat that no precise conclusions could be drawn from them.
That is why I propose that the circle should set about working out a questionnaire to be circulated among comrades in Russia and abroad, for concise replies to all questions.
If we have at our disposal raw material of this kind (if 100-200 comrades reply), the Congress could use it for precise conclu-sions.
I reiterate my proposals: first, a summary of all the minutes and also the minutes themselves should be submit-ted to the Congress; second, a start should be made on drawing up a questionnaire.
This should be done right away, without any delay, and I propose that all work in the section should be dropped in favour or putting the minutes in order and writing a report on them for the Congress.
II L e n i n.
Now that the announcement of the convocation of the Third Congress is out, the work of the sections has taken on a different character.
The sections have now been working for two months, but very little has been done, all things considered: the minutes are not all there, and there are no reports; we should make haste with this, so that all these efforts should be of practical importance and not go to waste, i.
e.
, all this should be placed before the Congress.
In order to submit the minutes as soon as possible, I propose that the whole circle should set about helping the secretaries.
I repeat that unless the circle completes this work, all its efforts threaten to remain within the circle itself, whereas they could help to work out organisational plans.
Furthermore, I propose that we should start right away on working out a questionnaire— we must make haste with all this, time does not wait.
The Congress may take place very soon.
The best thing is to entrust the working out of a questionnaire to a special committee.
III L e n i n .
I have no objections to Comrade Olga’s pro-posal.
As for my experience, I do not believe I have any, in view of the rapid change of events and conditions of work.
I did draw up a questionnaire, but it was much too general.
I propose that experienced comrades should be elected to a committee for drawing up the questionnaire, and that this business should be accelerated to the utmost.

PETERSBURG METALWORKS 152 From the Editors.
We publish this resolution by the worker-comrades as a characteristic manifestation of the mood that in cer-tain circumstances may sway a considerable section of the fighting proletariat.
* A Party split — especially a secret split — undoub-tedly inflicts countless calamities on the labour movement.
The above-mentioned Kharkov resolution 153 shows that there are Mensheviks in Russia who are much more con-scientious about their Party duty than the comrades abroad.
This is also shown by the new declaration issued by the C.
C.
together with the Majority Committees’ Bureau.

155 APRIL 1ù -ùû ( APRIL ù 5 -MAY 10), 1905 1 DRAFT RESOLUTIONS OF THE ORGANISING COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THE THIRD CONGRESS O N T H E R E P R E S E N T A T I O N O F C E R T A I N O R G A N I S A T I O N S 156 Caucasus The Organising Committee, having examined the question of the Caucasian delegation on the basis of the facts published in various writings and the testimony of witnesses, comrades from the Caucasus, has arrived at this unanimous decision: 1.
Among the votes at the Congress, it is necessary and solely correct to reckon the 8 votes of the Caucasian delega-tion, because back in the autumn of 1903, the C.
C.
approved the Rules of the Caucasian Union Committee, and under these Rules, the Caucasian Union Committee, as a Union Committee, was allowed 8 votes at the Congress.
2.
As for the contradictory statements by Comrade Glebov in the Council and the Council’s decision in May 1904 to regard temporarily, pending clarification of the question, as votes those of the four separate Caucasian committees (Baku, Batum, Tiflis and Imeretia and Mingrelia), the Organising Committee cannot consider this statement of Glebov’s and the Council’s decision an obstacle to the adoption of the conclusion stated in § 1, since Comrade Glebov has clearly shown himself to be uninformed, which is why he unwittingly misled the Council.
3.
Considering it unquestionable that there are now three delegates from the Caucasus with six votes, the O.
C.
states that Comrade Leonov, member of the Caucasian Union Committee, declares the following concerning the fourth delegate with two votes: the Caucasian Union Committee intended to allow the Batum Committee to approve this fourth delegate.
When the Batum Committee gave a vague and evasive reply on this matter, the Caucasian Union Committee, at a sitting attended by Leonov, expressed the wish that in the absence of a special delegate fromBatum at the Congress the votes of the fourth delegate should be transferred to Comrade Kamenev (Yuri).
4.
Stating this, the O.
C.
leaves it to the Congress itself to decide on the question of a fourth delegate from the Caucasian Union Committee.
Kremenchug Concerning the powers of the Kremenchug Committee the Organising Committee declares: 1) The Kremenchug Committee was approved by the Central Committee only in August 1904, according to Comrade Mark, a member of the C.
C.
, who attended the meeting of the C.
C.
at which the approval took place.
2) The Kremenchug Committee does not appear on the Party Council’s list of 33 empowered organisations, which was published in Iskra No.
89.
On the strength of the above stated, the O.
C.
decides: not to regard the Kremenchug Committee among the full-fledged organisations with the right of vote at the present Congress.
Yekaterinoslav The Organising Committee, having heard the report of Comrade Morozov, delegate of the Yekaterinoslav Majority Committee, and the written communication of Comrade Yevgeny, member of the old committee in Yekaterinoslav, reached the following unanimous decision: The Organising Committee does not see any grounds to consider the present Yekaterinoslav Majority Committee less legitimate than the Minority Committee either in formal terms or in terms of succession and ties with local workers.
However, in view of the fact that the O.
C.
has no opportu-nity of hearing the explanations of the other side, it does not adopt a decision on the vote of the delegate from the Yekaterinoslav Majority Committee, leaving it to the Congress itself to decide on the matter.
Concerning the powers of the Kazan and Kuban commit-tees, the O.
C.
has failed to reach any decision, as the votes of the C.
C.
and the M.
C.
B.
were split.
The M.
C.
B.
believes that these committees cannot be recognised as having the necessary powers because these committees did not appear on the list of committees approved until April 1, 1905, at the Council’s sitting in May 1904 (delegates Lenin and Glebov from the C.
C.
).
Even if the Kazan and Kuban committees were approved by the Central Committee after May 1904, they will at any rate be entitled to representation only after one year.
Besides, these committees could not have been approved at the general meeting of the C.
C.
in July 1904, because the minutes of this meeting were in their entirety delivered by Glebov to Lenin abroad, and they contained no informa-tion concerning the approval of the Kazan and Kuban committees.
Finally, nothing was said about it either at the August or September sitting of the C.
C.
, which was attended by C.
C.
member Comrade Mark.
The C.
C.
believes that since these committees were inserted in the Iskra list, apparently on behalf of the Party Council, we have no ground for recognising these committees as lacking the required powers.

DRAFT RESOLUTION O N T H E C O N S T I T U T I O N O F T H E C O N G R E S S 157 Concerning the point of the agreement between the C.
C.
and the M.
C.
B.
under which the Congress shall open in the presence of three-quarters of the delegates of the Russian committees, the O.
C.
resolves: Both sides, making up the O.
C.
, see this point as meaning that both the C.
C.
and the M.
C.
B.
should have taken the most vigorous measures to achieve full representation at the Congress and also to guarantee to the Party that the C.
C.
and the M.
C.
B.
have set themselves the aim of organis-ing an all-Party and not a factional congress.
This pointof the agreement was not at all meant to offset the effect of the paragraph of the Party’s Rules under which a congress is valid in the presence of one-half of the total number of votes.
As for the plenitude of representation at the Congress, all measures have been taken on that score.
There is no news only from the Astrakhan and the Crimean committees.
The selection of delegates and their dispatch abroad (in two instances, transfer of mandates from the Kuban Committee to comrades abroad, Parvus and a person to be appointed by the Iskra Editorial Board) have been carried out by the Don, Gornozavodsk, Kiev, Kuban, Tver, Kharkov, Smolensk, Siberian and Yekaterinoslav committees.
Together with the delegates available from 19 committees, we would have, with these 9 committees, a total of 28 committees, that is, more than three-quarters out of 34 committees (the figure of 34 is the maximum number of empowered organisa-tions initially on the O.
C.
list).
If 9 delegates from the said committees have failed to turn up at the Congress, despite the fact that they were given the corresponding mandates from the committees and arrived abroad, their absence is due to no fault of the O.
C.
, but to the fact that all the efforts of the O.
C.
to achieve full representation at the Congress were frustrated by the illegal resistance of the three members of the Party Council.

161 But there is a danger that the Congress will overdo the agenda debate.
The agenda at German Social-Democratic congresses runs to 5 or 6 items; we had up to 25 at the Second Congress.
There is already a danger of our debate getting out of hand.
I propose that we adopt as a basis the agenda with a better breakdown.

which are then lost and do not get into the minutes.
The committees do not have enough time for serious work, and it is not desirable to extend it to the detriment of the Congress work.
It would be well to elect a resolutions committee right away, so as to give our work some direction at least.
We also need a committee for examining the reports.
I doubt whether we need organisational, agrarian and armed uprising committees.

” The speeches of delegates have convinced me that it is the only way we can work fruitfully.
If we adopt the system of a general debate and subsequent discussion in committee, the result will be similar to that at the Second Congress.
Care must be taken to have the fullest possible publication of the Congress deliberations for the purpose of giving the Party the best information.
In view of the atmosphere of suspicion surrounding the Congress, it is especially necessary to give our debates the greatest possible publicity and the fullest record in the minutes.

C.
on April 24, 1905, I forgot to motion a proposal to invite Comrade Arnatsky (r e a l [NB] name), a member of the Kazan Committee, to attend the Congress with voice but no vote.
163 I request the Credentials Committee to examine this proposal.
Comrade Arnatsky is abroad, in France, and told me he was ready to attend the Congress at his own expense.
He will soon be going to Russia and could swiftly report to his committee on the Congress.
Despite all its efforts, the Organising Committee was unable to contact the Kazan Committee or obtain a reply from Kazan.
There is therefore almost no hope of the Kazan Committee taking part in the Congress.
Our efforts abroad to contact Kazan from over here have likewise failed, and there has been no reply to our letters.
Arnatsky has also failed to get in touch with Kazan from over here.
In view of the impossibility of having a delegate from the Kazan Committee to attend the Congress, should we not invite Comrade Arnatsky, as a member of the committee, to attend with voice but no vote? Lenin Motioned on April 1 3 (2 6 ) 2 To the Credentials Committee At the O.

Comrade Filatov is the author of the articles on the uprising in Vperyod, signed V.

For the Congress he has prepared a letter and a pamphlet-report: “Application of Tactics and Fortifications to a Popu-lar Uprising” (in a suitcase left in Boulogne).
I requestthat Comrades Belsky and Voinov who had worked with Comrade Filatov in Paris 164 should be asked to give him a reference.

I think the resolution should be reworded as follows: Motives: (1) stating that under the pressure of the revolutionary movement there is an actual beginning of open action by the political parties, etc.

(3) that there is a tremendous urge among the workers for the same thing (Schmidt’s point 2).
— c o n c l u s i o n s: (1) no occasion should be missed for open action, the workers to be organised into an independent force in the course of the action itself; (2) even the slightest legal forms should be used in an effort to get the legal labour organisations under Social-Democratic influence; (3) the idea should be spread in all labour organisa-tions and among the broadest possible masses of the need of taking practical measures to set up, alongside our secret apparatus, an apparatus for open political action.

2 I agree that “revolutionary way” is an expression for a more vigorous conduct of struggle, but this tends to minimise the concept of revolution.
I propose either that we replace it by the words “regardless of the law”, or that after “revolutionary way” we delete the words “minimal programme”, as it could be taken to mean that we want to carry through the whole revolution in this way.

It is not right to say (as Vlasov did) that in our country it is the intellectuals that are mainly the exponents of revolutionary Social-Democratic ideas.
II.
It is not right to say (as Vlasov did) that the elective principle will not make for better information of the outlying districts, etc.
III.
Vlasov said that it is the intellectuals that are at the head (of splits and oppositions).
This is confirmed by Latyshev, Lyadov, Kramolnikov, etc.

Since no formal confirmation has been forth-coming, there is no ground to rescind the resolution already taken by the Congress.
The Kazan representative must remain at the Congress with voice only, while the commit-tee, according to the Credentials Committee’s proposal, should seek formal confirmation right away.

What, after all, does Comrade Mikhailov want? Does he want the agreements to be concluded only by the C.

C.
’s general resolutions are binding on local committees.
It is unreasonable to consider the special case in which the Menshevik C.

got something wrong.
The local committees should also be allowed to display initiative.
We should authorise the local commit-tees as well to co-ordinate the activity with Social-Democratic organisations locally.
If the C.

Things in Russia have reached the point of an uprising, and in such conditions an agreement is highly unlikely.
Even if some Osvobozhdeniye groups or liberal-minded students willing to act arms in hand are to be found, we really cannot conclude an agreement with a man like Struve.

Does it follow from Marx’s “Address” to the Commu-nists in March 1850 192 that Marx regarded it as inconceivable for Communists to take part in a provisional revolutionary government together with the bourgeoisie in the epoch of a democratic revolution? 2.
Is it true that in this “Address” Marx did not even raise the question of Social-Democratic participation in a provisional revolutionary government? 3.
Is there any difference between: “regard participation as inconceivable” and “not to raise the question of partici-pation”? 4.
Is it true that in this “Address” Marx himself noted a strengthening of the petty-bourgeois democratic party and a weakening of the Communist workers’ party in the recent period? 5.

201 It has restocked its food supply and has sailed for an unknown destination, having seized a Russian merchant ship with a cargo ofcattle.
It is reported that it has also obtained some coal from a British merchant ship.
There is no question at all of surrender.
The Potemkin has set itself the task of sparking off an uprising in all the coastal cities.
Here is the text of a manifesto which the Potemkin is circulating (according to a report by a German newspaper from Bucharest).
“To all civilised citizens and to the working people! The crimes of the autocratic government have exhausted all patience.
The whole of Russia, burning with indignation, exclaims: Down with the chains of bondage! The government wants to drown the country in blood, forgetting that the troops consist of sons of the oppressed people.
The crew of the Potemkin has taken the first decisive step.
We refuse to go on acting as the people’s hangman.
Our slogan is: freedom for the whole Russian people or death! We demand an end to the war and the immediate convocation of a con-stituent assembly on the basis of universal suffrage.
That is the aim for which we shall fight to the end: victory or death! All free men, all workers will be on our side in the struggle for liberty and peace.
Down with the autocracy! Long live the constituent assembly!” Proletary No.

THIRD CONGRESS TO THE TEXT OF THE MINUTES Concerning the number of votes at the Congress, the Minutes Committee requests readers to bear the following in mind.
At the Congress, there were 46 votes represented by 23 delegates, of whom one had one vote, one had three and the rest, two each.
(With the arrival of Comrade Golubin, i.
e.
, from the 18th sitting on, there were 24 delegates.
) Almost all the voting at the Congress was counted according to the number of delegates, i.
e.
, for the sake of simplicity, it was assumed that all the delegates had one vote each.
That is why the number of votes for and against adds up to 23 and not to 46.
It goes without saying that this simplifi-cation of the count could not have any effect on the results, because both the number of votes for and the number of votes against were equally halved.
There was not a single instance of a division of votes where a decision depended on a single comrade with three votes.

Written in late September 1 9 0 5 First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin Miscellany XVI Printed from the original RUSSIA’S FINANCES We have repeatedly pointed out that the autocratic government is more and more confused over its financial affairs (tricks would be an apter word, I think).
It is increas-ingly obvious that a financial collapse is inevitable.
Here is an interesting confirmation of this.
The Berlin correspond-ent of the London Economist, 215 one of the most influential organs of the European financial barons, reported on October 11 as follows: “A representative of the Mendelssohn Bank has been in St.
Peters-burg this week to take part in the negotiations between the Russian Government and French bankers for the much-heralded new Russian loan.
According to apparently authentic statements given out here, the amount to be raised will be about £75,000,000 [about 700 million rubles], of which France is to take about half, while the rest is to be offered in Germany, Holland, England, and the United States.
It is also stated that a large part of the issue is to be devoted to taking up the Treasury notes placed in France and Germany during the war.
That Russia should appeal to the money markets at just this junc-ture, when all the great centres are under unusual pressure, is taken as striking evidence of its financial straits.
One version of the story, however, has it that only a small part of the sum above mentioned is to be offered for subscription now, while the rest will be raised later, presumably early next year.
But this only increases the unfavourableimpression as to the urgency of Russia’s needs.
That there is no en-thusiasm in Germany for a Russian loan just at this moment goes without saying.
Not only the condition of the money market here, but, more than all, the continuance of political turmoil in Russia, and the visible weakening, not to say breakdown, of Governmental authority there, are facts that are being weighed in Germany in a manner that augurs ill for the forthcoming subscription.

KALININ’S ARTICLE “THE PEASANT CONGRESS” 216 1 We see, consequently, that class-conscious socialists must unconditionally support the revolutionary struggle of all, even the prosperous, peasants against the officials and landowners, but class-conscious socialists must make the clear and straightforward statement that the “general redistribution” 217 the peasants want falls very far short of socialism.
Socialism demands the abolition of the power of money, the power of capital, the abolition of all private ownership of the means of production, the abolition of the commodity economy.
Socialism demands that the land and the factories should be handed over to the working people organising large-scale (instead of scattered small-scale) production under a general plan.
The peasant struggle for land and liberty is a great step towards socialism, but it is still a very far cry from socialism itself.
2 .
.
.
The tactical resolution adopted by the Congress is truly astound-ing by its meagreness.
We are inclined to think that there some of the peasant well-wishers (liberals) must have done some more “ex-plaining” .
Here is the resolution: “The activity of the Peasant Union, depending on local conditions, may be either open or secret (conspiratorial).
All members of theUnion must spread their views and seek to realise their demands in every possible way, being undeterred by the resistance on the part of the Zemstvo chiefs, the police and other authorities.
Among other things, they are insistently advised to make use of their right to draw up public decisions at village and volost meetings and private gather-ings concerning improvements in state amenities and improvement of the people’s welfare.
” That kind of resolution is extremely unsatisfactory.
Instead of a revolutionary call for an uprising, it merely gives liberal advice of a general sort.
Instead of organising a revolutionary party, the resolution only organises an annex to the liberal party.
The progress of the movement itself will inevitably and inescapably split up the liberal landowners and the revolutionary peasants, and we Social-Democrats will try to accelerate this split.

“Is it necessary to prove that these assertions are false and absurd?” writes the indignant Rech.
It appears, Messrs.
Cadets, that it is, and even highly, necessary to do so, because in the same article (“Famine and Politics”) we read: “This struggle (between the Duma and the present ministry), a slow and hard struggle, has resulted, however, in the question concerning a responsible cabinet being brought down from the sphere of abstract Considerations to the soil of concrete reality, and in it being discussed as one of the real possibilities.
”That is very good.
But what about the question of dissolv-ing the State Council, the question of amnesty, the ques-tion of universal, etc.
, suffrage? Have all these questions likewise become “real possibilities” already? Surely, they have not, have they? After all, there is so far not even a rumour about them.
That being so, what is one to do? “It is necessary to prove.

4 Printed from the Ekho text AMONG THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES On second thoughts, Rech finds that the general has asked much too much for his patronage of the Cadet minis-try and it declares that the Cadets will not give up the principle of compulsory alienation of the land in favour of the peasants and total amnesty, whatever portfolios they may be offered.
We think that the general, being the practical statesman that he is, will see no reason for spoil-ing the deal over a matter of principle.
After all, under the Cadet plan not the whole of the land is subject to com-pulsory alienation, but only as much as has to be allocated to the peasants to enable them to pay the state taxes; further-more, the owners of the alienated land are to be paid in cash “on a fair valuation” and these days money is ever so much easier to manage than land, which no longer brings in as much income as before, in view of the stubborn refusal of the peasants to cultivate it for others.
As for the amnesty, the Cadets have already done their duty to the country by informing the supreme authorities of the people’s unani-mous desire to see prisoners and exiles at liberty, and, to refrain from encroaching on the inalienable prerogative of the crown in this business, have decided to kill the amnesty bill which the Trudovik group intends to table in the Duma.
226 What the devil does General Trepov still want? Let’s have done with the bargaining, General, and hand over the reins to the new driver, “without any pangs,without any fatal brooding, and without futile and empty doubts”: after all, in case of failure the “extreme measures ” will still be at your disposal.

6 Printed from the Ekho text AMONG THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES Following the unsuccessful affair of the Cadet-Octobrist-official ministry, the government has tried to scare the Cadets with the prospect of a dictatorship.
Now the Cadets are trying to scare the government with the prospect of a revolution.
Rech writes: “The conflagration is spreading—such is the impression of the news coming by cable from every corner of Russia.
.
.
.
It is no longer the revolutionary intelligentsia or even the working class that is aflame; the peasantry, the troops are aflame too.
That is, it is more correct to say that the whole of Russia is in flames.
.
.
.
At the slightest pretext, the peasants flock in their thousands to deal summarily with the authorities, the landowners, the estates and the manors.
” On the subject of this “conflagration”, Prof.
Gredeskul hastens to show the depth of his understanding of the histor-ical events: “We are undoubtedly on the eve of crucial events.
Either the gov-ernment will come to its senses within the next few days and hand the power over to a Duma ministry, or it will bring us to the greatest disasters.
” And so, it is either a revolution or a Cadet ministry.
It is not surprising at all that a Cadet tries to use everything, the people’s spontaneous revolutionary activity above all, to demonstrate the need for a Cadet ministry.
However, he is labouring under a delusion: the antidote — a Cadet ministry — which the Cadet quacks are now prescribing for the revolution will not work against the poison of spon-taneous revolutionary action by the mass, against its urge, to which Rech itself testifies, to realise its right to freedom of assembly (not the Cadet freedom of assembly, but full freedom) and to all the land.
You can go on trying hard, gentlemen, but the revolution has coped with the Witte-Durnovo system, and it will also cope with the Cadet antidotes.
* * * It is either a revolution or a Cadet ministry, says Rech and adds: we beg to inform you that we, for our part, are not afraid of the revolution, whereas you are going to get hurt.
But those who know how to take a militant stand at a fighting moment are well aware of the worth of such talk.
Novoye Vremya, 227 an organ of the pogromites and sergeant-majors, is also well aware that Messrs.
Gredeskuls give a reminder of the revolution only because they fear it like the plague.
That is why Novoye Vremya, we believe, gives a much better exposé of the psychology and political substance of the deal which is being prepared, when it says: “Messrs.
Cadets, we both have the same fear of the revolution, but we have almost exhausted our resources in the struggle against it, and you still have a thing or two left, which is why you should get on with it and not drag things out for too long.
” That is just what they are saying.
The Cadets say: we for our part can afford to wait.
But the Novoye Vremya gentlemen urge: come, make haste, the revolution is pressing.
The latest issue of Novoye Vremya says as much: “.
.
.
there will be an explosion the responsibility for which will fall not only on the present ministry, but also on the Cadet Party, which is guilty of the fact that being reluctant, for want of courage, to lose a part of its popularity among the extreme Left-wingers, it has led the Duma into a fatally drawn-out conflict and has committed a crime against the law of peaceful evolution, insisting on an immediate militant implementation of a political programme, a process which requires a very, very long time.
” That’s how things are: there is a bit of bargaining, a bit of scaring, and then a deal is done, for they have a common cause and a common aim.

7 Printed from the Ekho textAMONG THE NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES The newspaper Mysl 228 carries an interesting “proscrip-tion list” of the Yaroslavl Administration.
Dozens of per-sons (56 in the town of Yaroslavl and 17 in the town of Rybinsk) are marked off in it as “suspects”, and a secret report requests the police department for “appropriate instructions”.
In this connection, Mysl says: “Let everyone pass judgement.
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
He that hath reason to understand, let him understand.
The police department has now conceived a grandiose operation for the simultaneous radical and “final liquidation” of a number of organ-isations over the entire Russian land through a massive “seizure”, unprecedented in scale, of persons suspected of adherence to the Social-ist-Revolutionary and Social-Democratic parties, and the peasant and the railway unions.
For that purpose, the department has demand-ed full lists of suspected persons from the local authorities.
These “proscription lists”, concentrated in one place, by now contain almost ten thousand names of persons over whom arrest hangs like the sword of Damocles.
” And so, the government is hatching another plot.
Mili-tary preparations against the people, “measures” to dis-solve the Duma, and lists containing 10,000 names for arrest! As in October-December, the government has made a “dead set” at the revolution, utilising the relative freedom to lure out and destroy thousands of more fighters for freedom.
Let one and all, therefore, be at their post.
The govern-ment is prepared — the revolutionary people must also be prepared.

Petersburg and Moscow Committees, Polish Social-Democrats and the Latvians 230 1.
We have had to accept a struggle on the Duma basis only through the fault of the treacherous bourgeoisie.
2.
We must base the election campaign on opposition between revolutionary and “peaceful” struggle, showing the great danger of Cadet hegemony in the emancipation move-ment.
Hence the question: is a bloc with the Cadets (agree-ment at the first stage) admissible? 3.
At the first stage, Social-Democracy must, as a general rule, act independently; by way of exception — agreements at the first stage with the parties recognising the constit-uent assembly, armed uprising, etc.
; at the second stage — agreements of a technical character, only for the propor-tional distribution of mandates.
There is nothing more dangerous than to tell the masses: vote with us for the conciliators.
Krushevan is dangerous not because he has a seat in the Duma, but because he is a particle of the Black-Hundred organisation supporting the government.
For the sake of small separate exceptions you support Cadet hegemony, thereby upsetting the whole of our principled position (the Caucasus, Moscow, St.
Petersburg, Poland refuse to have agreements).
If the Black-Hundred men are returned, the Duma will simply be more violent.
Why do you believe that it is not the Cadets but the Social-Democrats who are to blame for a return of the Black-Hundred men — in the event of a split in the vote? First published in 1 9 6 0 in Vol.

We say: we sometimes go along with the revo-lutionary bourgeoisie, but never with the opportunist and treacherous bourgeoisie.
The election campaign will proceed between two extremes: 400 Cadets & 100 Social-Democrats (through agreement) and 200 Black-Hundred men & 250 Cadets & 20 or 50 Social-Democrats (without agreement).
To put forward both an agent and a fighter is to hit out at one ’ s own positions.
The Black-Hundred men will be defeat-ed through agreements, but then the Social-Democrats will also be defeated (morally).

ON BEHALF OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES OF POLAND, THE LATVIAN TERRITORY, ST.
PETERSBURG, MOSCOW, THE CENTRAL INDUSTRIAL REGION AND THE VOLGA AREA The Bund delegates have tabled a resolution at the con-ference which almost entirely repeats the resolution of the Bund’s Seventh Congress, and which gives a historicalassessment of the Duma boycott.
232 The undersigned dele-gates to the conference have abstained in the voting on this resolution for the following reasons.
It is wrong and impossible to separate the question of why we go into the Duma 233 from the question of how we get there.
Recognition that the boycott is correct means that the basic character of all our tactics remains absolutely the same under the present participation in the election as it was during the boycott of the First Duma.
To recognise that the Cadet majority of the First Duma was a hindrance to the activity of the revolutionary elements, while endorsing agreements between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats at the first stage of the elections is to have our general premises beaten by our practical policies.
To recognise and support Cadet hegemony in agitation before the masses by putting up common electoral rolls only to condemn this hegemony later in a special additional resolution, is to compromise in the strongest possible way all the tactics and all the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy.
Those are the grounds on which we place before the entire R.
S.
D.
L.
Party the following minority opinion.
“The tactics of boycotting the State Duma, which helped the mass of the people to form a correct opinion of the impo-tence and lack of independence of that institution, found complete justification in the farcical legislative activities of the State Duma and in its dissolution.
“But the counter-revolutionary behaviour of the bour-geoisie and the compromising tactics of the Russian liber-als prevented the immediate success of the boycott and compelled the proletariat to take up the struggle against the landlord and bourgeois counter-revolution also on the basis of the Duma campaign.
“The Social-Democrats must wage this struggle outside the Duma and in the Duma itself in order to develop the class-consciousness of the proletariat, to further expose to the whole people the harmfulness of constitutional illusions, and to develop the revolution.
“In view of this state of affairs, and for the purposes mentioned above, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party must take a most energetic part in the present Duma campaign.
“The principal objects of the Social-Democratic election and Duma campaigns are: firstly, to explain to the people the uselessness of the Duma as a means of satisfying the demands of the proletariat and the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, especially the peasantry.
Secondly, to explain to the people the impossibility of achieving political liberty by parliamentary methods as long as the real power remains in the hands of the tsar’s government, and to explain the necessity of an armed uprising, of a provisional revolution-ary government and of a constituent assembly elected by universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot.
Thirdly, to criticise the First Duma and reveal the bank-ruptcy of Russian liberalism, and especially to show how dangerous and fatal it would be for the cause of the revolu-tion if the liberal-monarchist Cadet Party were to play the predominant and leading role in the liberation movement.
“As the class party of the proletariat, the Social-Demo-cratic Party must remain absolutely independent through-out the election and Duma campaigns, and here, too, must under no circumstances merge its slogans or tactics with those of any other opposition or revolutionary party.
“Therefore, at the first stage of the election campaign, i.
e.
, before the masses, it must as a general rule come out absolutely independently and put forward only its own Party candidates.
“Exceptions to this rule are permissible only in cases of extreme necessity and only in relation to parties that fully accept the main slogans of our immediate political struggle, i.
e.
, those which recognise the necessity of an armed uprising and are fighting for a democratic republic.
Such agreements, however, may only extend to the nomi-nation of a joint list of candidates, without in any way restricting the independence of the political agitation car-ried on by the Social-Democrats.
“In the workers’ curia the Social-Democratic Party must come out absolutely independently and refrain from entering into agreements with any other party.
“At the higher stages of the election, i.
e.
, at the assemblies of electors in the towns and of delegates and electors in the countryside, partial agreements may be entered into exclu-sively for the purpose of distributing seats proportionatelyto the number of votes cast for the parties entering the agreement.
In this connection, the Social-Democratic Party distinguishes the following main types of bourgeois parties according to the consistency and determination of their democratic views: (a) the Socialist-Revolution-aries, the Polish Socialist Party and similar republican parties * ; (b) the Popular Socialists 235 and the Trudoviks of a similar type **; (c) the Cadets.

Saying that this could be an exaggeration, Larin believes that the S.

The only fully published minutes of the First Congress of the S.
R.

Party’s membership.
The fact is that no such data could have been available, because elections to a party congress by all the members of the party, proportional to a definite number of party members, have never been held by any party in Russia except the Social-Democrats.
The Social-Democratic Party alone proclaimed this principle in November 1905 in the newspaper Novaya Zhizn on behalf of the Bolshe-* Perhaps the Zionist socialists 234 also come under this category.

We are not com-petent to judge of these matters without having the opinion of the Jewish Social-Democrats.

However he used this figure (which is about one-third of the membership of the R.

9 of Proletary, which said that instead of “peace and positive work” such a merger would actually result in growing dissension, to say nothing of its being unacceptable for reasons of principle.
Interest-ing confirmation of what we then said came from an article by Léon Remy in the French Socialist newspaper L’Humanité 239 on December 17, 1906.
Tribune Russe, 240 the S.
R.
Party’s official organ abroad, quoted Remy as saying that the “Council” of the S.
R.
Party “reckons the party to have about 150,000 organised members, and if the concept of membership is given a somewhat broader inter-pretation, such as that given to the Rules by some regional committees, the figure is 200,000”.
To enable readers to judge for themselves how this curious figure was obtained, we cite all the district data given in Remy’s article.
North-west — 21,000; Volga area — 14,000 (“almost double the figure if all those accepting the party’s programme are included”); Northern Caucasus — 21,000; Transcaucasus — 17,900; Centre — 26,000 (including 5,000 in Moscow.
It is odd that our Moscow comrades have been unable to discern these 5,000 even through a magnifying glass); North — 20,000.
Here is a problem for the reader to solve: who has dis-played more thoughtlessness — 1) S.
R.
s, 2) Larin, or 3) Ple-khanov and Axelrod?The picture is hardly improved if in this matter of a mer-ger with the S.
R.
s, the latter two disavow their ardent admirer Y.
Larin.
One need only give thought to drawing a line of distinction between the “all-Russia representatives” and the industrial workers and agricultural labourers, farm hands or journeymen and peasants, artisans or craftsmen and working men, etc.

ON ELECTORAL AGREEMENTS IN ELECTIONS FOR THE SECOND DUMA 241 JANUARY 6 (19), 1907 BRIEF NEWSPAPER REPORT The rapporteur notes the absence in St.
Petersburg of any Black-Hundred danger tales of which are being spread about by the Cadets in order to induce the electorate to vote for them.
The local Social-Democrats are faced with the question of how to release the masses of the population in the capital from the ideological hegemony of the Cadets.
Considerable sections of the urban poor who are semi-pro-letarians keep wavering between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats.
The Cadets have been trying to bribe them by promising seats in the Duma in order to reinforce their influence on them.
That is why it would, perhaps, be advis-able to enter an agreement with the revolutionary-demo-cratic parties and groups so as to work together to under-mine the influence of the Cadets.
The rapporteur believes that it is up to the practical workers in the local organisation to decide on the actual need and possibility of an agreement and also on its forms.

(point 1, a) “strive to extend and sharpen these conflicts (meaning the conflicts both between the government and the Duma, and inside the Duma itself) to limits making it possible to use them as starting-points for broad mass movements aimed at.
.
.
” etc.
Have the Mensheviks abided by this direction of the Congress? In the matter of the presidium have they extended and sharpened the conflict between the Duma Left wing and the Cadets? No, the Mensheviks have been committing a breach of the Congress’s decision.
Furthermore, in the same resolution the Congress directed: “.
.
.
that this intervention should be conducted in such a way as to make these sharpening clashes: (a) reveal to the mass the inconsistency of all the bourgeois parties which under-take to act as spokesmen for the people’s will in the Duma, and (b) bring the broad mass (the proletariat, the peasantry and the urban petty bourgeoisie) to an awareness that the Duma is totally useless”, etc.
Consequently, the Mensheviks could, without risking anything at all, or abandoning absolutely legal ground — the Mensheviks were duty-bound to show the mass, i.
e.
, openly in the Duma, that the Cadet presidium is a presidium of a party which has turned its back on the revolution.

“.
.

4) to stimulate the political activity of the masses and, organising the forces of the revolution outside and inside the Duma, to create conditions for transforming the latter into a strongpoint of the revolution.
.
.
.
” Starting from November 1906, the Mensheviks have moved so far over to the right that they at once broke their own resolution.
Their first step tends to disorganise the “forces of the revolution” inside the Duma, fortifying the masses in the hope of a peaceful outcome, for a Cadet pre-sidium elected by the entire Duma, without a protest from the Left, would be an official nation-wide confirmation by the Social-Democrats of the very hopes which they recog-nise as being “illusory”.
The Cadets have openly and totally turned away from the revolution.
The “forces of the revolution” are the Left, the Trudoviks, the S.
R.
s (the revolutionary bourgeoisie) and the Social-Democrats.
To help organise, instead of disorganising, the “forces of the revolution” we are duty-bound to tell the masses: the Social-Democrats support a Left-wing, Trudovik presidium against the Cadets.
In the event a Trudovik presidium were elected and failed to live up to democratic hopes, we should then use this to expose the democratic petty bourgeoisie before the mass, thereby strengthening the conviction that the proletariat is the only consistently democratic class.
What did the C.
C.
tell the Party and the people when starting the election campaign? We find that the official electoral platform of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
says: “.
.
.
Citizens, the only men to elect to the Duma should be those who not only want Russia to be free, but strive to help the people’s revolution to win this freedom.
.
.
.
The First Duma failed to do this.
Its majority, led by the ‘people’s freedom’ party, had hoped to secure freedom and and through peaceful negotiations with the government.
.
.
.
That is why it is not meek petitioners that should be elected to the Duma.
.
.
.
Citizens, elect revolutionary fighters whowill join you in carrying forward the great cause started in January, October and December of last year.
” What fine, grand words, fitting for the proletariat! What a pity that for the Mensheviks they have turned out to be empty words.
In their party electoral platform they condemned the Cadet majority in the First Duma and its Cadet policies, but are now helping artificially to restore Cadet hegemony in the Left-wing Duma.

Polny tekst protokolov, Central Committee publication, Paris Printed from the text of the book ON THE TASKS OF THE PROLETARIAT AT THE CURRENT STAGE OF THE BOURGEOIS-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION 249 Considering: 1) that because of the drawn-out economic crisis through which Russia is now going, and in connection with the extreme intensification of government reaction, there is a marked sharpening of class struggle between the proletar-iat and the bourgeoisie and also a deepening and extension of the peasants’ struggle against the old system; 2) that this last year of the revolution has been marked by a rapid growth of the political awareness of all classes, a strengthening of the wing parties, a decline of constitu-tional illusions, a weakening of the “centre”, i.
e.
, the liberal parties, striving to stop the revolution by means of conces-sions acceptable to the Black-Hundred landowners and the autocracy; 3) that the class interests of the proletariat in the bour-geois revolution demand the creation of conditions which would open up the possibility for the broadest struggle against the propertied classes, for socialism; 4) that the only way to create these conditions is to win a democratic republic, full popular power and the minimum of social and economic demands necessary for the proletariat (8-hour working day and other demands of the Social-Democratic minimum programme);5) that the proletariat alone is capable of carrying the democratic revolution to the end, provided that, as the only consistently revolutionary class in contemporary society, it leads the mass of peasants in a relentless struggle against the landowners’ estates and the serf-owning state, the Congress recognises: a) that the main task of the proletariat at the current historical moment is to carry the democratic revolution in Russia forward to the end; b) that any minimisation of this task inevitably results in the working class being transformed from the leader of the people’s revolution carrying with it the mass of the democratic peasantry, into a passive participant in the revolution tailing behind the liberal bourgeoisie; c) that while supporting the implementation of this task with all its strength, the Social-Democratic Party should never lose sight of the proletariat’s independent, socialist aims.

* ) The Russian amendment also had this provision: “in such a way that the ruling classes would not dare to use it (youth) as an instrument to consolidate their class domi-nation against the lighting proletariat”.
These words were deleted by the commission not because anyone disagreedwith them in principle, but because they were regarded by the Germans as being illegal and capable of providing a pretext for the dissolution of German Social-Democratic organisations.
This abridgement did not alter the essential meaning of the corresponding passage of the resolution.

.
.
In the event of a danger of war, the working class and its parlia-mentary representatives in the countries concerned must, relying on the support of the International Bureau, do everything they can to prevent a declaration of war, by every means which they consider reasonable, and the choice of which depends on the degree of aggravation of the class struggle and the general political situation.

Written in the second half of August 1 9 0 7 Published in early September 1 9 0 7 in the first collection of Golos Zhizni, St.
Petersburg Printed from the text of the collection NOTES TO CLARA ZETKIN’S ARTICLE “INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONGRESS IN STUTTGART” 251 INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONGRESS I N S T U T T G A R T *) * ) This article is a translation of an editorial in the German Social-Democratic fortnightly Die Gleichheit (Equality), 252 which is edited by Clara Zetkin and is the organ of the women’s labour movement in Germany.
The assessment of the Stuttgart Congress is here given with remarkable correctness and talent: clear, concise and bold propositions sum up the tremendous ideological context of the Congress debates and resolutions.
For our part, we add several notes to this article to indicate to the Russian reader some facts coming from the West-European socialist press, facts largely distorted by our Cadet and semi-Cadet news-papers (like Tovarishch253), which have told many lies about the Stuttgart Congress.
.
.
.
The question of relations between the Social-Democrats and the trade unions went best to show the unanimity of class-conscious pro-letarians of all countries.
No one any longer objected in principle against the basic historical tendency of the proletarian class struggle— to connect as closely as possible the political and the economic struggle, and also organisations in both, into a single force of the socialist working class.
Only the representative of the Russian Social-Democrats, Plekhanov, and the majority of the French delegation fell back on rather unsatisfactory arguments *) in an effort to justify some re-strictions on this principle by referring to the special conditions pre-vailing in their countries.
.
.
.
* ) The Russian Social-Democratic delegation in Stutt-gart had a preliminary discussion of the questions in sub-stance with a view to appointing its representatives to the commission.
In the commission on relations between the trade unions and the socialist parties, Plekhanov did not represent all the Russian Social-Democrats, but only the Mensheviks.
Plekhanov went into the commission to stand up for the principle of “neutrality”.
The Bolsheviks sent Voinov to the commission and he stood up for the Party’s view, i.
e.
, the decision in the spirit of the London Congress against neutrality, and for the closest contacts between the trade unions and the Party.
Consequently, Clara Zetkin regarded as “unsatisfactory” the arguments not of the R.
S.

representative, but of the representative of the Menshevik opposition in the R.

And here, ultimately, the revolutionary energy and indomitable faith of the working class in its own fighting capacity won out, on the one hand, over the pessimistic credo of its own impotence and hidebound stand for the old and exclusively parliamentary methods of struggle, and on the other, oversimplified anti-militarist sport of the French semi-anarchists à la Hervé.
*) .
.
.
* ) The author of the article, while contrasting the two deviations from socialism rejected by the Congress: Hervé’s semi-anarchism, and opportunism, included in the “exclu-sively parliamentary” forms of struggle, fails to name any spokesmen of this opportunism.
In the commission of theStuttgart Congress, on the question of militarism, the same antithesis was made by Vandervelde when he objected to the opportunist speech of Vollmar.
Vollmar hints at Hervé’s expulsion, said Vandervelde, but I protest against this and warn Vollmar, because the expulsion of the extreme Left-wingers would suggest the idea of expelling the extreme Right-wingers (Vollmar is one of the most “Rightist” German opportunists).
.
.
.
Finally, on the question of women’s suffrage as well, the sharply principled class standpoint, which regards women’s suffrage as noth-ing but an organic part of the proletariat’s class right and class cause, won out over the opportunist bourgeois view which hopes to wheedle out of the ruling classes a mutilated and curtailed suffrage for women.
*) .
.
.
*) At the Congress in Stuttgart, this bourgeois stand-point was backed only by an Englishwoman from the Fabian Society (a quasi-socialist organisation of British intellec-tuals taking an extremely opportunist stand).
.
.
.
At the same time, the Congress—confirming the resolution of the International Women’s Conference on this point—stated unequivocally that in their struggle for suffrage the socialist parties must put forward and uphold the principled demand for women’s suffrage, regardless of any “considerations of convenience”.
*) .
.
.
* ) A hint at the Austrian Social-Democrats.
Both at the International Socialist Women’s Conference and in the Congress committee dealing with the women’s question, there was a polemic between the German and the Austrian Social-Democratic women.
Clara Zetkin had earlier re-proached the Austrian Social-Democrats in the press for pushing into the background the demand for women’s suffrage in their agitation for electoral rights.
The Austrians put up a very lame defence, and Victor Adler’s amendment, which very cautiously conducted “Austrian opportunism” in this question, was rejected in the commission by 12 votes to 9.
Written in September and early October 1 9 0 7 Published in October 1 9 0 7 in the collection Zarnitsy, issue I, St.
Petersburg Printed from the text of the collectionANTI -MILITARIST PROPAGANDA AND YOUNG SOCIALIST WORKERS’ LEAGUES It will be recalled that the International Socialist Con-gress in Stuttgart discussed the question of militarism and in connection with it the question of anti-militarist prop-aganda.
The resolution adopted on the point says, in part, that the Congress regards it as a duty of the working classes to “help to have working class youth brought up in a spirit of international brotherhood and socialism and imbued with class consciousness”.
The Congress regards this as an earnest of the army ceasing to be a blind instru-ment in the hands of the ruling classes, which they use as they see fit and which they can direct against the people at any time.
It is very hard, sometimes almost impossible, to conduct propaganda among soldiers on active service.
Life in the barracks, strict supervision and rare leave make contact with the outer world extremely difficult; military discipline and the absurd spit and polish cow the soldier.
Army com-manders do everything they can to knock the “nonsense” out of the “brutes”, to purge them of every unconventional thought and every human emotion and to instil in them a sense of blind obedience and an unthinking wild hatred for “internal” and “external” enemies.
.
.
.
It is much harder to make an approach to the lone, ignorant and cowed soldier who is isolated from his fellow-men and whose head has been stuffed with the wildest views on every possible subject, than to draft-age young men living with their families and friends and closely bound up with them by common inter-est.
Everywhere anti-militarist propaganda among young workers has yielded excellent results.
That is of tremendous importance.
The worker who goes into the army a class-conscious Social-Democrat is a poor support for the powers that be.
There are young socialist workers’ leagues in all European countries.
In some, for instance, Belgium, Austria and Sweden, these leagues are large-scale organisations carrying on responsible party work.
Of course, the main aim of the youth leagues is self-education and the working out ofa distinct and integrated socialist outlook.
But the youth leagues also carry on practical work.
They struggle for an improvement in the condition of apprentices and try to protect them from unlimited exploitation by their employers.
The young socialist workers’ leagues devote even more time and attention to anti-militarist propaganda.
For that purpose, they try to establish close ties with young soldiers.
This is done in the following way.
Before the young worker has joined the army, he is a member of a league and pays membership dues.
When he becomes a soldier, the league continues to maintain constant con-tacts with him, regularly sending him small cash aids (“soldier’s sous” as they call them in France), which, however small, are of substantial importance to the soldier.
For his part, he undertakes to provide the league with regu-lar information about everything that goes on in his barracks and to write about his impressions.
Thus, even after he joins the army, the soldier does not break off his ties with the organisation of which he was a member.
An effort is always made to drive the soldier as far away from home as possible for his service.
This is done with the intention of preventing the soldier from being tied with the local population by any interest, and to make him feel alien to it.
It is then easier to make him carry out orders: to shoot at a crowd.
Young workers’ leagues try to bridge this alienation between the soldier and the local population.
Youth leagues are connected with each other.
When he arrives in a new town, the soldier, a former member of a youth league at home, is met by the local league as a welcome visitor, and he is at once brought into the circle of local interests and helped in every possible way.
He ceases to be a new-comer and a stranger.
He is also aware that if any misfortune befalls him he will receive help and support.
This awareness adds to his courage, he gains assur-ance in his behaviour in the barracks, and is bolder in standing up for his rights and his human dignity.
Their close ties with young soldiers enable the youth leagues to carry on extensive anti-militarist propaganda among the soldiers.
This is done mainly with the aid of anti-militarist literature, which the youth leagues publish and circulate in great quantities, especially in France,Belgium and also in Switzerland, Sweden, etc.
This litera-ture is highly diverse: postcards with anti-militarist pic-tures, anti-militarist army songs (many of these songs are very popular among the soldiers), “soldier’s catechism” (in France it was circulated in more than 100,000 copies), all sorts of pamphlets, leaflets, appeals; weekly, fortnightly and monthly newspapers and magazines for soldiers, some of them illustrated.
Barracks, Recruit, Young Soldier, Pju pju (a pet name for the young recruit), and Forward are very widely circulated.
For example, in Belgium the newspapers Recruit and Barracks have a printing of 60,000 copies each.
Especially many magazines are published at the time of the draft.
Special issues of soldiers’ newspapers are mailed to the homes of all recruits.
Anti-militarist literature is delivered to soldiers in the barracks and handed out to them in the streets; soldiers find it in coffee-houses and pubs, and everywhere else they go.
Recruits receive special attention.
They are given a cere-monial send-off.
During the recruitment, processions are staged in the towns.
In Austria, for instance, recruits walk through the town dressed in mourning and to the strains of funeral marches.
In front of them rolls a decorated red carriage.
All the walls are plastered with red posters which say in large letters: “You will not shoot at the people!” Evening parties with ardent anti-militarist speeches are held in honour of the recruits.
In short, everything is done to awaken the recruit’s consciousness, to ensure him against the evil influence of the ideas and emotions which will be instilled into him in the barracks by fair means and foul.
The work of the socialist youth is not in vain.
In Belgium, there are almost 15 soldiers’ unions in the army, which are mostly affiliated with the Social-Democratic Labour Party and are closely allied with each other.
In some regi-ments, two-thirds of the soldiers are organised.
In France, the anti-militarist mood has become massive.
During the strikes at Dünkirchen, Creusot, Loguivi, Monso-le-Min the soldiers ordered against the strikers declared their solidarity with the workers.
.
.
.
As time goes on, there are more and more Social-Democrats in the army and the troops become increasingly less reliable.
When the bourgeoisie has to confront the organ-ised working class, whom will the army back? The young socialist workers are working with all the enthusiasm and energy of the young to have the army side with the people.

1 6 , October 8 , 1 9 0 7 Printed from the Vperyod text HOW THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES WRITE HISTORY In No.
5 of Znamya Truda, 254 the Central Organ of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, we find an editorial on the Stutt-gart Congress, which is written in a torrent of words and immoderate boasting, the habitual style of the S.
R.
s.
There is a reprint of the telegram in which the C.
C.
of the S.
R.
Party informed Europe that “the revolutionary strug-gle commands it to remain at its post”.
The selfsame C.
C.
voices its complete satisfaction over the “usual energy” displayed by the Socialist-Revolutionary representative in the Bureau.
255 “By its resolution, the Socialist Interna-tional endorsed the view of the trade union movement which we have always supported,” Znamya Truda assures us.
Despite the dogmatist Kautsky, the Congress “turned out to be on our side” on the question of a legislative intro-duction of a minimum wage.
Within three years, “we Russian socialists have grown into a great mass party, a fact the International has openly and respectfully (!!!) recognised”.
In short, thirty thousand couriers were dispatched from Europe to pay their respects to the Socialist-Revolution-aries.
Meanwhile, the malignant Social-Democrats carried on with their “petty intrigues” in the Russian section, namely, they fought against the equality of votes for the S.
D.
s and the S.
R.
s which the Socialist-Revolutionaries demanded.
The Social-Democrats demanded 11 votes for themselves, 6 for the Socialist-Revolutionaries and 3 for the trade unions.
The Bureau resolved: 10 for the S.
D.
s, 7 for the S.
R.
s and 3 or the trade unions.
“Adler and Bebel, who voted against our demand, declared that they had no wish at all to mini-mise the importance of the S.
R.
Party, which they recognised as an important factor of Russian socialism and the revo-lution.
But they wanted to be fair and to state the approx-imate balance of forces” (Znamya Truda).
Our Khlestakovs 256 are imprudent, oh so imprudent! There was not and could not have been any question in the Bureau either of the significance of the S.
R.
s, or of the “important factor”.
Once a party has been admitted to the Congress and the Bureau, the Bureau and its members will not bother to assess its significance and importance.
The only thing the Bureau can assess is the strength of the par-ties for apportioning the votes.
Bebel and Adler agreed with the arguments of our Social-Democratic representative in the Bureau that the S.
D.
s and the S.
R.
s are not equal in strength.
Having agreed with these arguments, they naturally noted that they were not passing judgement either on principles or trends, that they were not deciding on the dispute between the S.
D.
and the S.
R.
programmes, but were merely weighing their strength for apportioning the votes.
It is entirely in the Khlestakov spirit to interpret this self-evident reservation to mean recognition of the Socialist-Revolutionaries as “an important factor”.
The S.
R.
s are being doubly imprudent when, in reporting from memory and distorting the meaning of Bebel and Adler’s reservation, they say nothing at all about the arguments on the substance of the case.
They give us Bebel’s reservations with embellishments, but are silent on the substance of our dispute.
Why is that so? In substance, our representatives in the Bureau had the following argument.
The Social-Democrat referred to the number of deputies in the Second Duma as the most precise criterion of party strength, adding that the electoral law favoured the peasants over the workers.
The S.
R.
replied that apart from the S.
R.
group there were some near-S.
R.
s in the Duma — the Trudoviks and the Popular Socialists.
A portion of them, he implied, should be added to the S.

s! Besides, the Popular Socialists have some “first-class writers” (“écrivains de premier ordre”, said Rubanovich).
Those were the Socialist-Revolutionary’s very words.
To this the S.
D.
representative replied: indeed, the Popu-lar Socialists do have some “first-class writers” as do theFrench Radical-Socialists and the Radicals, 257 say, a man like Clemenceau (also a “first-class writer”).
But is it proper for an independent party to refer to another party as evidence of its own strength? Is it proper, when the “first-class writers” among the Popular Socialists have not the slightest intention of requesting admission to the Con-gress? Is it proper, let us add, to present oneself as an ultra-revolutionary in Russia and to drag along the Popular Socialists for help in Europe? Proletary No.
1 7 , October 2 0 , 1 9 0 7 Printed from the Proletary text THE THIRD DUMA AND SOCIAL -DEMOCRACY The Third Duma, 258 convened on the basis of the elec-toral law which was promulgated by the tsar after the dissolution of the Second Duma on June 3, 1907, opened on November 1, 1907.
The old electoral law, issued on December 11, 1905, 259 was a far cry from universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot, and distorted the will of the peo-ple, turning the Duma into an ugly expression of that will — especially after the “interpretation” of the law given in the Second Duma by the Senate, consisting of old civil servants and justices entirely subservient to the tsarist autocracy.
On June 3, the tsar deprived the workers, peasants and urban poor of the trifling electoral rights they had enjoyed.
In this way, the autocracy committed another heinous crime against the people by forging popular representation and handing the Duma over to the landowners and capitalists, the mainstay of the tsarist autocracy and the age-old oppressors of the people.
That they would dominate the Duma could have been predicted.
That is exactly what happened.
At present, returns are in on the election of 439 members of the Duma.
The eight non-party members aside, the other 431 belong to four main groups: 1) the largest — the Right-wingers, Black-Hundred deputies, numbering 187; 2) then the Octobrists 260 and parties close to them, numbering 119;3) the Cadets and like-minded men, 93; 4) the Left-wingers, 32 (of them, 16 to 18 Social-Democrats).
Everyone knows who the Black-Hundred men are.
It is true that among their adherents there is a section of igno-rant, unclass-conscious workers, peasants and urban poor, but their governing core consists of feudal-minded landown-ers, for whom the preservation of the autocracy is the only salvation, because it alone can help them to plunder the public till, receiving grants, loans, good salaries and handouts of every sort; the autocracy with its police and army alone gives them the possibility of keeping in bondage the peasantry, which suffers from lack of land and is fettered with labour services and irredeemable debts and arrears.
The Octobrists also include landowners, mainly those who engage in large-scale sales of grain from their estates and require the patronage of the autocracy to secure lower customs tariffs on their grain abroad, to keep down the costs of transporting the grain abroad by Russian railroad and to secure the best possible prices from the treasury when it purchases the alcohol, which many landowners produce from potatoes and grain at their distilleries, for the vodka monopoly.
But apart from these predatory and greedy land-owners, many of the Octobrists are equally predatory and greedy capitalist manufacturers, factory-owners and bankers.
They, too, are in need of the government’s patron-age to secure high tariffs on foreign goods, so that Russian goods could be sold at three times their price, to secure fat contracts from the treasury for the capitalist factories, etc.
They want the police and the army to turn the workers into the same sort of slaves that the peasants are under the feudal-minded landowners.
Naturally, the Octobrists are very close to the Black-Hundred men.
Should the Duma examine government revenue and expenditure — they will put their heads together to see that the full burden of the taxes falls on the peasants, the workers and the urban poor, while the revenues go into the pockets of the capitalists, the landowners and senior civil servants.
Should the question arise of allocating land to the peasants or improving the condition of the workers — the Black-Hundred men and the Octobrists will pull togeth-er to sell, at a threefold price, only those lands which theydo not need, stripping the peasants, impoverished as they are, of everything they have; they will try very hard to fetter the hands and feet of the workers, who are already hard pressed by the burden of capitalist exploitation.
And, of course, both the Black-Hundred men and the Octobrists will strain very hard to have the largest possible police and army to provide protection for their “precious” life and their “sacrosanct” property: after all, they fear the revolu-tion like the plague, they are terrified by the prospect of a mighty drive by the workers and peasants rising to the great struggle for liberty and land.
Together the Octobrists and the Black-Hundred men will constitute a vast majority in the Third Duma: 306 out of 439 members.
This majority can do just what it wants.
It is against the revolution, or, as the more common saying is, it is counter-revolutionary.
But there may be questions on which the Octobrists will differ with the majority of the Black Hundreds.
The latter’s effrontery knows no bounds.
They are sure that the police truncheon, the whip, the machine-gun and the bayonet alone will put down any revolution, any popular urge for light and freedom.
They would like to rely on the autocracy and do as they wish with the public revenue, using it for their own benefit, taking over all the lucrative posts and treating the country as their own estate.
The Octobrists remember that up to now the landowners and the civil servants have run things in a way that gave them every-thing and left hardly enough for the capitalists.
Two plun-derers — a Black-Hundred man and an Octobrist — quarrel over a succulent titbit, over who is to get more.
The Octo-brists refuse to let the Black Hundreds have everything or even the greater share: just recently, the Japanese war gave them an object lesson, making them realise that the Black Hundreds bungled things in such a way that they inflicted losses even on themselves, to say nothing of the capitalists and the merchants.
That is why the Octobrists want to take over some of the power in the state and wish to frame the constitution for their own benefit and, natu-rally, not for the benefit of the people.
In so doing the Octobrists want to deceive the people by diverse laws which have the appearance of introducing reforms and improving things for the state and the people, but actually serve theinterests of the rich.
Like the Black Hundreds, they are of course prepared to rely on the machine-gun, the bayonet and the whip against the revolution, but to be on the safe side they want to seal the eyes of the masses with the aid of fraudulent reforms.
To do all this, the Octobrists need allies other than the Black Hundreds.
It is true that in these matters as well they hope to detach a section of the Right wing from the ultra-Black Hundreds of the Union of the Russian People, 261 but that is not enough.
That is why they have to seek for other allies who are also hostile to the revolution, but who are enemies of the Black Hundreds, favour fraudulent or petty reforms, and support the constitution in the in-terests of the big and possibly a section of the middle bourgeoisie.
It is easy for the Octobrists to find such allies in the Duma: they are the Cadets, a party of that section of the landown-ers, the big and middle bourgeoisie which has quite adapt-ed itself to conducting a really good capitalist economy, like that in the West-European countries, and based like-wise on the exploitation and oppression of the workers, the peasants and the urban poor, but an exploitation which is clever, subtle and artful, an exploitation you do not see right through all at once.
There are many landowners in the Cadet Party engaged in real capitalist operations, and similar factory-owners and bankers, many lawyers, professors and doctors with good incomes, derived from the rich.
It is true that in their programme the Cadets promised the people a great many things: there was univer-sal suffrage and all the freedoms, an 8-hour working day, and land for the peasants.
But all that was said merely to attract the masses of people, for they never actually made any straightforward proposal for universal suffrage even in the first two Dumas; their bills on the freedoms were in fact aimed at giving the people as little freedom as possible; in the Second Duma they proposed a 10-hour day instead of the 8-hour day, and they were prepared to let the peasants have land which was of no use to the capital-ist economy, and which carried redemption payments, and let them have so little of it that even if the peasants got it, they would still have to work for a wage on the neigh-bouring landowners’ estates.
That was a clever trick to which the workers did not rise at all, very few peasants did and only some of the urban poor actually took the Cadets at their word.
Today, after the dissolution of the two Dumas, the Cadets have grown very quiet and are making up to the Octobrists: they declared that they regard the revolution-aries and especially the Social-Democrats as their enemies, and, believing the Octobrists to be constitutional-minded, voted for an Octobrist to fill the post of Duma Chairman.
The deal is ready.
It is true that Minister Stolypin does not apparently want a permanent deal and wants to keep the Cadets in submission, thereby exerting an influence on the Octobrists, but in practice there will still be constituted another majority in the Duma—the Octobrists and the Cadets.
Together they number 212, slightly less than half, but they will also have the non-party men behind them, and these num-ber 8, so that the majority will be there; and even among the Rightists some might vote with the Octobrists and the Cadets on some questions.
Of course, this other majority will also be counter-revolutionary and will fight against the revolution; it will merely cover up with trifling reforms which are of no use to the people.
Can these two majorities in the Third Duma defeat the revolution? The great Russian revolution cannot stop until the peas-ants receive land in any appreciable quantity and until the masses of people secure the main influence on the admin-istration of the state.
Can we expect the two Duma major-ities to produce all that? The question is in itself ridiculous: can the feudal-minded landowners and plunderous capital-ists be expected to give land to the peasants and give up the supreme power to the people? No! They will throw a starving peasant a crust, after stripping him of everything he has, and they will help only the kulaks and the sharks to make themselves comfortable, taking all the power for themselves and leaving the people oppressed and subjugated.
The Social-Democrats must naturally do everything they can to continue the people’s great cause — the revolution, the struggle for liberty and land.
In the Duma, the government behind the Octobrists, and the Cadets want to play a double game.
The government, while stepping up its persecutions and putting down Russia with the aid of bayonet, noose, prison cell and prison camp, pretends to be an advocate of reform.
The Cadets, who have actually embraced the Octobrists, pretend that they are real champions of liberty.
Both want to cheat the people and stamp out the revolution.
Let us see that this does not happen! The Social-Demo-crats, consistent and loyal fighters for nation-wide eman-cipation, will unmask the hypocrites and the cheats.
Inside and outside the Duma they will expose the tyrannies of the Black-Hundred landowners and the government, and the Cadet tricks.
They will — they must — understand that there is now need for more than a relentless struggle against the government; the Cadets must not be given either direct or indirect support.
The Social-Democrats must above all raise their voice to expose most sternly and relentlessly the foul tsarist crime perpetrated on June 3, 1907.
Let the proletariat’s spokesmen in the Duma explain to the people that the Third Duma cannot serve their interests, that it cannot meet their demands and that this can be done only by a sovereign constituent assembly elected through universal, direct and equal suffrage by secret ballot.
The government will propose new laws.
The Octobrists, the Cadets and the Black Hundreds will do the same.
All these laws will be a brazen swindle of the people, a gross violation of their rights and interests, a mockery of their demands, a mockery of the blood shed by the people in the struggle for liberty.
All these laws will provide protection for the interests of the landowners and the capitalists.
Each of these laws will be a fresh link in the chains of bondage which the oppressors and the parasites want to clamp on the workers, the peasants and the urban poor.
Not everyone will understand this right away.
But the So-cial-Democrats know and understand this, and that is why they will expose this boldly before the cheated people.
In so doing, they must devote special attention to the laws which relate to the people’s most vital needs: the laws on land, the laws on labour, on state revenue and expenditure.
In branding the violence and fraud of the feudal-minded land-owners and the capitalists, the Social-Democrats mustexplain their demands to the entire people: full powers for the people (a democratic republic), unrestricted liberty and equality, the 8-hour working day and the easing of working conditions for labour, confiscation of large estates and the handing of land over to the peasants.
They must also point to the great goal which the proletariat of all countries sets itself — socialism, complete abolition of wage slavery.
Alongside the Social-Democrats in the Duma there is a small group of Left-wingers, mainly the Trudoviks.
The Social-Democrats should urge these men to go along with them.
This is especially necessary when there is occasion to direct questions to the government which is running ram-pant all over Russia like a wild beast.
Every day, the watch-dogs of tsarism — the police, the gendarmes — and the higher authorities — ministers and governors — permit themselves gross acts of violence and lawlessness.
They must be ex-posed and branded.
And it is up to the Social-Democrats to do this.
But a question to the government requires the signatures of 30 members of the Duma, and the Social-Democrats will hardly number more than 18.
Together with the other Left-wingers they are 32.
The Social-Demo-crats must draw up the questions and urge the Left-wingers to join them.
If the Leftists really cherish the great cause of liberty, they must do so.
A heavy blow will then be in-flicted on the government, like those the Social-Democrats inflicted on it with their questions in the Second Duma.
Such are the main tasks of the Social-Democrats in the Third Duma.
Our comrades have some hard work to do.
They will be there among enemies, malicious and ruthless.
Efforts will be made to stop their mouths, and they will be showered with abuse, they will perhaps be expelled from the Duma, brought to trial, thrown into prison and exiled.
They must be firm, in spite of all persecutions, they must hold high the proletariat’s red banner and remain loyal to the end to the great cause of struggle for the people’s eman-cipation.
And all of us, comrades workers, must join forces in supporting them; we must lend a sensitive ear to their every word, respond to it, discuss their acts at meetings and rallies, reinforcing by our sympathies and approval their every correct step, helping them with all our strengthand resources in the struggle for the cause of the revolution.
Let the working class be united in supporting its spokesmen, and in so doing may it strengthen its unity which it needs in the great struggle— the time when the “last decisive battle” is fought.

It is this communication which has been entirely confirmed by Grigory, and not clearly refuted by Ezra, that constitutes the i l l e g a l i t y of the act by the Mensheviks and the illegality of discussing s u c h questions by the Bund Cen-tral Committee.
I insist, therefore, on a search for the text of the letter itself.

That is why by starting his speech with a statement that on this question there were now no differences between the Caucasians and Golos Sotsial-Demokrata, Comrade Pyotr of Tiflis had no reason at all to mention my name.
As for the earlier debates, I merely spoke of the differences between some members of the Golos Sotsial-Demokrata Editorial Board and the Caucasians, which were revealed at the August Plenary Meeting of the C.

Isn’t that duplicity? At the general Party conference Dan said: Doesn’t everyone know that Lenin is being accused of Menshevism? I replied: Read Proletary and judge on that basis, instead of collecting gossip.
At the time, Maximov was silent.
Nothing is worse than the absence of open struggle.
I say: Our unity based on principle has been disrupted, you say something else, and yet you call Lenin Martov.
.
.
.
Why is the present meet-ing illegal in Party terms? Members of the Bolshevik Centre elected at the Congress are talking about how best to conduct Bolshevik views.
What is so inadmissible about that? In agitating for a special Bolshevik congress you show that you have lost all faith in the Party principle.
We havealways stood for the Party principle, ever since the Second Congress, and are now continuing the same line, while you are preaching a split at the grass roots.
There is also a pro-Party trend among the Mensheviks.
We believe in the Party principle and stand up for it.
First published in 1 9 3 4 in the book Protokoly soveshchania rasshirennoi redaktsii “Proletaria” (Minutes of the Proletary Enlarged Editorial Board Conference) Printed from the text of the book verified with the minutes 2 Maximov says that there has been no agitation for a congress.
Lyadov, Stanislav, and Vsevolod have spoken out with sufficient clarity.
Since May 1908, Lyadov and Stanislav have been agitating in Russia.
We have Stani-slav’s resolution, which says clearly enough what he wants.
273 This is a mockery of our faction.
The Mensheviks have an orthodox-Marxist, Plekhanovite, trend and the Bolsheviks also have an orthodox-Marxist trend.
Both the Mensheviks and we have the Valentinov-Maximov liquidationist trend, etc.
Concerning Comrade Maximov’s statement, I repeat that what I said was in reply to Maximov’s words: “a fully Leninist-Plekhanovite faction is crystallising”.
First published in 1 9 3 4 in the book Protokoly soveshchania rasshirennoi redaktsii “Proletaria” Printed from the original 2 SPEECH IN THE DEBATE ON THE QUESTION O F O T Z O V I S M A N D U L T I M A T U M I S M 274 JUNE 9 (22) I want to deal with the “idea of the centre”.
Maximov has mixed things up over the Kotka conference 275 ; this is how it was: if the Poles were in favour of a boycott and my vote were decisive, I declared that in that case I pre-ferred to vote with the Bolsheviks.
That was the condition I put in respect of the Poles.
At that time, the whole Bolshevik Centre was against the boycott.
The faction, how-ever, was for the boycott, but there was no split, becausethere was no group which wanted one.
A year later, the faction turned out to be on our side.
There are some “Bol-sheviks” who are afraid of hitting out at the otzovists and of siding with the Mensheviks.
At the conference I joined with the Mensheviks against the otzovists.
That is what you think about the centre.
The story of the split as related by Maximov is a curious one.
Maximov’s papers say nothing about the centre but Mikha’s letter has now been authenticated.
The letter said that Lenin was conducting a Right-wing Bundist line.
That is in the documents.
Mikha wrote what Maximov is now saying.
There is your idea of the centre.
We got this letter from our Caucasian friends, who handed their mandate over to the Rightist Ilyich.
Mikha conducted this policy in July 1908 with the participation of the group.
Maximov says that we shall confer with Plekhanov.
Of course, we shall, as we shall with Dan, and Martov in the C.
O.
276 It took a fierce struggle at the conference to get the otzovists to be loyal.
We confronted them with ultimatums.
When Axelrod read the point about military-combat tasks, he said: “It is not hard to work with such ‘Bolsheviks ’ .
” We shall not let the otzovists into the Duma commissions, where we were with Dan.
Indeed! We shall confer with Plekha-nov, as we shall with Dan and Martov.
You can say as much in the press.
In the C.
C.
I confer with Marat.
You, Marat, are a member of the faction of-divine otzovists.
I am not talking about good intentions but about the political line.
I ask you, comrades, to give thought to what is being said about Ple-khanov.
When Plekhanov speaks of his mistake in respect of the trade unions, we are reproached for failing to repulse him.
When he is prepared to sacrifice his mistake, the ques-tion is whether we are attracting him by the article against Lunacharsky or whether you are repulsing the minority of the pro-Party Mensheviks 277 and the orthodox-Marxist Mensheviks for the sake of Bogdanov-Lunacharsky anti-Marxist propaganda.
We have not made a deal with Ple-khanov against Lunacharsky, but we can tell you who is flirting with whom.
When Plekhanov kicks out Potresov, I am prepared to give him my hand.
This is not a new cen-tre, but a new caricatured Bolshevism.
We are havinga replay of the old Rosa Luxemburg story.
278 But the replay here is caricatured, and “Bolshevism” must be safeguarded from it.
“Bolshevism” must now become strictly Marxist.

Comrade Maximov has no reason to be excited, because there has never been a single split without extreme accu-sations, and split incidents have always been confused with matters of honour.
I remember the scenes with Kri-chevsky in 1901, with Martov in 1905, and with Plekha-nov in 1907 — and all of them attacked me with cries about honour.
It is not a question of honour, but of the fact that in the process of struggle men tend to disorganise their faction and organise a new one.
Take Lyadov as an example.
He has not become a bad comrade, but he is disorganising our faction and trying to set up a new one.
I think that Maximov is disorganising those whom he believes to be Mensheviks.
He has a perfect right to do that, but he keeps telling us about Lenin’s being invited to the school.
The question of control is a ridiculous one too.
We can’t have that.
It is clear that the school is a new centre, a new trend.
Marat says that he will not abandon his posts.
You, Com-rade Marat, have succumbed to the factional fervour which is determined by the political struggle of the “divine” otzovists.
What is a faction? It is an alliance of like-minded persons within a party.
In the Duma, the party is an alliance of like-minded men inside the Duma.
After all, when a mem-ber of the Duma, like Khomyakov, goes over to another party he does not cease to be its chairman.
The same appliesto a faction in the party.
The party alone can relieve you of the post which you have taken up on behalf of the party, We are now quarrelling — it is because we have no alliance of like-minded men.
No one is encroaching on your Party post and there is no point in bringing it in.
We do not have a split in the Party, but in the faction.
The writ of our conference does not run to Party posts.
And honour has nothing to do with all this.
For my part, I am used to that sort of thing: this is the fourth time I am being abused.
We must recognise what there is: two centres, two trends and the school as a fact.
And when we group out, everything will be much clearer.

We should, therefore refrain from exchanging abuse at the last moment.
That is undignified.
Marat says that he is being invited to kick himself out.
When Marat declared that he preferred to work with the anti-otzovists rather than with the otzovists, his declaration was met with cries of “Bravo!” No one accused him of setting up the break-away centre at Capri, his statement on god-building was quite definite.
He is wrong in formal terms.
For our part we did not take the division beyond the point where the separate centres of like-minded partisans had already taken shape.

As for the failure to send a delegate to the general Party conference, Vishnevsky seems to be making a mistake.
Pole-tayev said that the deputies would arrive if Dan sent a tele-gram.
Dan refused to do so.
The conference has suffered greatly because of the absence of the delegate.
280 You say that the well-informed persons 281 should not be expelled.
The way to fight them is through publicity.
More information should be given about them.
They should be grouped and characterised.
The question of the Proletary Editorial Board’s secretary attached to the Duma group.
The secretary was not equal to his task and wrote in a highly formal manner; Steklov is not the man for this job; there is need for a man to do the spade-work.
The information should be as circumstantial as possible, otherwise all the promotion groups will be quite useless.
The Paris promotion group 282 is a delicate matter.
We shall support Plekhanov’s line; the other Mensheviks take a very nervous attitude to this.
A rapprochement with the Mensheviks of the Dan type is hard.
How is a group to be formed? The Mensheviks will get a crowd in.
Nothing except a fight can be the result.
Perhaps, in order to avoid a squab-ble the group should be set up under the C.
O.
Nothing can be done in the Duma group without well-informed persons from the Bolsheviks.
For this we should legalise two or three men.
One suggestion is Vadim, and perhaps Kamenev.
Concerning the participation of local organisations in the activity of the Duma group.
Broad leaflet agitation should be started.
Definite specimen leaflets about Duma activity should be issued.
The revolutionary Social-Demo-cratic use of the Duma will be neither revolutionary nor Social-Democratic without the influence of the organisa-tions.
There is need of leaflets on the subjects of the Duma speeches.
This kind of thing will involve the organisations in the work and give them an impetus.
Up to now, insuffi-cient use has been made of deputies’ meetings.
They wasted most of their time on debates with the otzovists.
There is also need for leaflets on the party grouping in the Duma and, finally, leaflets on the work of the Duma in general.
It is not only the C.
C.
representatives, but also the organ-isations that should direct the Duma group.
We must have leaflets on the meaning of this or that speech in the Duma.
Take the question of foreign policy.
Our deputies were the only ones to speak.
This was not properly assessed.
There is need for leaflets with extracts from speeches.
I see no other way for the organisations’ participation except in the form of leaflets.
The disorganisation is desperate, the leaflet activity should be pressed forward vigorously.
Criticism in foreign newspapers is late.
Parliamentary speeches will always say less than everything.
The i’s will be dotted by the leaflets.
It is sometimes very hard for the organisations to send their representatives.
As for the newspaper, there is only one condition: a majority secured for us, but I do not believe it is possible to realise such a paper.

There is need for a popular organ, but the question depends on various other combinations, for instance, finance.
It is not right to prohibit assistance for the legal press in such resolute terms as Vlasov has done.
I think it would be use-ful to publish a small magazine, about the size of, say Dal, 285 which the Menshevik liquidators are publishing.

C.
Plenary Meeting in January 1910 292 the Bolsheviks bent every effort to restore the composition of the C.
C.
and help it to resume its activity.
C.
C.
members Makar and Innokenty contacted local Party organisations and Party members working in the open labour movement, together with them nominated candidates for co-optation to the C.
C.
, etc.
But the efforts of the C.
C.
Bolsheviks ended in the arrest of both.
They got no help at all from the Golos people in their work in Russia.
The representatives of the Mensheviks, elected at the London Congress, Mikhail, Yuri and Roman, who have now gone over to the independ-ent legalists, have not only refused to work in the C.
C.
, but have announced that they consider its very existence harmful to the labour movement.
In 1910, following a break of several months, Comrade Makar, who escaped from exile, and Comrade Vyazemsky once again set up a bureau for convening the C.
C.
* The Bundist Yudin, a member of the Bureau, took part in their work.
Over a period of six months, they once again established contacts with local organisations, nominated candidates for the C.
C.
, dispatched agents, and joined the Duma group in organising the election campaign for the by-elections in Moscow.
Of the representatives of the Mensheviks, they succeeded in contacting only Comrade Kostrov, who once or twice came merely to exercise his right to vote in the event it came to a convocation of the C.
C.
After working for six months, the C.
C.
Bolsheviks were arrested together with several candidates for co-optation to the C.
C.
, the comrade secretary and a number of other * This provisional bureau was recognised both by non-Russian organisations and by our Party’s C.
C.
Bureau Abroad and C.
O.
persons variously connected with the Bureau’s activity.
In a letter sent from prison after their arrest, the comrades C.
C.
members stated that the gendarmes had kept them under constant surveillance for a number of months and had been informed of their every step, and that there was no doubt at all about the provocation over the preparations for conven-ing the C.
C.
in Russia.
Following the arrest of two members of the Bureau (Makar and Vyazemsky), the C.
C.
members still at large — Yudin and Kostrov — displayed no activity at all over a period of two and a half months, even failing to send any letters either to the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad or to the C.
O.
As a result of the 18-month effort to restore the C.
C.
in Russia, the four Bolshevik members (Meshkovsky, Innoken-ty, Makar and Vyazemsky) are either in exile or in prison.
The gendarme inquiries and a whole number of arrests have made it quite clear that the authorities are most thoroughly informed about all the London candidates 293 and C.
C.
members and that their every step is being watched.
In view of all these circumstances to make a fresh attempt to convene the C.
C.
in Russia would be to court certain failure without any hope of success.
The only possible way out of this situation would be to call a Plenary Meeting abroad.
Nine persons with the right to take part in the Plenary Meeting are abroad.
294 This will constitute more than one-half of its full membership (15 persons).
They juridically can and essentially must declare themselves to be the Plenary Meeting.
The proposal to postpone the constitution of the Plenary Meeting until the convocation of the other members would mean many more months of delay.
With the exception of Mikhail, Yuri and Roman, who have openly announced their break with the C.
C.
and their sympathies for liquidating the Party, the Mensheviks could “bring together” Kostrov and Pyotr.
The Bolsheviks could bring together Meshkovsky, Innokenty, Rozhkov and Sammer.
It is hard to say how many months this would take.
In the light of the experience it has had, the real meaning for the Party of this protracted “work of bringing together ” formal candidates is nil.
It is even worse than nil, for thegame of allocating places in central bodies hides from local organisations and groups the sad reality in respect of which vigorous action must be taken.
After eighteen months of unsuccessful attempts to restore the activity of the C.
C.
, to feed the Party with more endless delays would be an affront to the Party.
We do not intend to have a hand in any such affront.
At present the real position of the Party is such that almost everywhere in the localities there are small Party workers’ groups and cells that meet irregularly.
They enjoy great prestige among the workers everywhere.
Every-where they are combating liquidator-legalists in the unions, clubs, etc.
They are not yet connected with each other.
Their supplies of literature are extremely rare.
In these groups of workers, there is a rallying together of Bolshe-viks, pro-Party Mensheviks and some of the Vperyod supporters 295 who have not been drawn into the separate Vperyod faction set up abroad.
The Vperyod group used all the period since the Plenary Meeting to help from abroad in strengthening and separat-ing its faction in organisational terms.
Its representatives have withdrawn from the Diskussionny Listok Editorial Board 296 and the School Commission under the C.
C.
297 The Vperyod group has failed to carry out the decisions of the last Plenary Meeting, and has, in fact, done everything to hamper the Social-Democratic general Party work.
Prepara-tions for the forthcoming elections have long since been started in the legal and illegal Party literature.
Mean-while, the Vperyod group, far from assisting the Party in this extremely important political action, has even failed to state unequivocally whether in general it favours partic-ipation in the elections to the Fourth Duma 298 or opposes participation in them.
Even in their latest statements in the press, the Vperyod group leaders abroad continue to flirt with the otzovists.
A far more serious anti-Party and anti-Social-Democratic force is the faction of the independent legalists (Nasha Zarya,299 Dyelo Zhizni, 300 and the Golos people who, like Dan, Martov & Co.
, cover them up).
It has been proved beyond doubt that they recognise no Central Committee and publicly ridicule Central Committee decisions.
They cannot andwill not carry out the last Plenary Meeting’s decisions (“Not to minimise the role of an illegal party ” , etc.
).
They cannot help taking the opposite line of action.
No Social-Democrat can doubt that the “independent legalists” can be expected to conduct an election campaign for the Fourth Duma on their own, apart from and against the Party.
The task of the Social-Democratic Party members is clear: the Party workers’ circles in Russia should be openly and resolutely urged to start preparations for the elections immediately.
Only committed Party men, only comrades realising the danger of the liquidationist trend should be nominated as Social-Democratic candidates.
Direct action against independent legalists must not be postponed for a single day; the workers must be warned right away of the danger posed to the Social-Democratic Party by the inde-pendent legalists at the elections.
Such is the task of the day for our Party.
Any deviation from such an approach to the question, which has been posed by life itself (and by the independent legalists), all delays, or attempts by the legalists to repeat the game of “promises” and “assurances” are fraught with great danger to the Party.
Our practical conclusion: the meeting of the nine must absolutely and immediately issue a manifesto to the Party in which the failure to convene the Central Committee in Russia is truthfully and fully described, and which calls upon local Party circles to display initiative and establish local and regional committees, to set up and support a Central Organising Commission, to set up and support Social-Democratic press organs (where, as in Zvezda, 301 which is being published with the participation and support of the Social Democratic Duma group, there should be no place for the liquidators), urging them to conduct a deter-mined and implacable struggle against the independent legalists and to make for closer ties in their work between representatives of the true Party elements, without regard for trend.
In the event that not only five of the nine members of the C.
C.
, but a solid majority of the nine agree to regard themselves as a Plenum of the C.
C.
, this meeting of the C.
C.
must immediately co-opt new members, set up an Organis-ing Commission for calling a conference and start practical preparations for election to the Fourth Duma.
Representa-tives of pro-Party Mensheviks should be seated on the Organising Commission and the C.
C.
right away.
The C.
C.
meeting must at once start a resolute struggle against the independent legalist group.
It stands to reason that this struggle is incompatible with the participation of independ-ent legalists in central Party bodies, which they have sabotaged, obstructed, weakened and kept in a morbid state for eighteen months.

The Latvian comrade’s approach was different from that of the Bundist.
He said that although he had not been elected, in view of the conditions of the Plenary Meeting’s convocation he deemed it his duty to take part in it, and to submit a subsequent report to the C.

of the Latvian Territory, with the proviso that the decisions would enter into force in the Latvian Territory only upon their approval by the C.

of the Latvian Territory.
2 In fact, comrades here are being fooled.
303 We know that Makar and Lindov did something, contacted organisations, appointed agents and contacted the candidate.
They were arrested.
Since then we have had no news from any of thosewho remained.
They have even failed to inform either the C.
O.
or the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad.
No work has been done.
It is no longer possible to deceive the Party with a Russia Bureau 304 or a Russia C.
C.
Convening the C.
C.
in Russia is a phrase that helps Stolypin.
Ionov’s statement says that he will send his invitation to the Bund C.
C.
305 When is he going to do so? How much time has elapsed? Why is there no reply? Ionov says that not having the powers he cannot attend a meeting of the C.
C.
members.
Why then is Lieber here? I propose a reso-lution on Ionov’s reply, because it makes clear that an intrigue is being carried on.
3 Let us sum up what has been said about the Bureau.
It turns out that the remaining members of the Bureau were meant.
About the work it is said that no work has been done.
Comrade Adrianov is a prominent Menshevik and the Mensheviks would have been aware of his work if he had done any.
Even his closest associates know nothing about it.
Any further attempt to play up the existence of a bureau somewhere is to deceive the Party.
In view of the arrests, Ber could not contact the Bund C.
C.
What then is the Party to do? It cannot afford to wait.
There must be initiative in this case.
4 Ber is shouting about the law, but at the same time he has been resolutely fighting in the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad against the law and in favour of the liquidators.
306 This kind of behaviour makes me doubt the sincerity of his state-ments and expect him to make fresh attempts to break up all-Party institutions.

PLENARY MEETING MAY 30 (JUNE 12) 1 307 I state that for six months the lower institution (C.

Bureau Abroad) has been violating decisions and refusing to convene the higher institution.
I am forced to state this in order to give a warning against putting any trust in an institution which for six months now has been trying to close the Party’s way to a resumption of its central insti-tution.
2 I point out that as early as the spring of 1910 we had a letter from Inok saying that C.
C.
members were being shadowed.
We fought with every means against the Russian gamble.
308 Makar resumed the business in 1910 and the dispatch of money right away revealed the hopelessness of the attempt.
It was quite plain at once that to call the C.
C.
in Russia meant to send people to gaol.
From the spring of 1908 to the 1910 Plenary Meeting the C.
C.
did not meet in Russia a single time.
The history of the convo-cation in Russia shows that the task is unfeasible.
Sending the C.
C.
to Russia was tantamount to sending it to prison.
3 309 Over a period of 18 months, four Bolsheviks have been arrested while doing central work.
Not a single Menshevik has been arrested because they have been working to set up a Stolypin party.
Letters were not written to us and correspondence was suspended for reasons of secrecy.
The Mensheviks, far from working to set up the C.
C.
, even refused to attend for co-optation (Mikhail, Roman and Yuri), Pyotr has been nowhere near the Bureau, while Kostrov lived close by.
It is an incontrovertible fact that only the Bolsheviks have been working.
Concerning Lyubich we have a letter from Inok indicat-ing his consent to work.
Concerning Pyotr we merely have the information that he has been nowhere near the Bureau.
A C.

We have nothing in common with the architects of a Stolypin labour party or with those who are helping them.

We know that there are people who, while recognising the need to fight the liquidators, object to a complete break with them and continue (even now!) to speak of “concilia-tion” or “agreement”.
Among these people are not only the “loyal servitors” of Trotsky, whom very few people now take seriously.
The advocates of conciliation and agreement are making a big mistake: the 18 months have shown in practice that the legalists do not fulfil any obligations.
How can there be an agreement with men who do not carry out their obligations?? Isn’t it ridiculous to speak of an agreement, when the speaker is unable to state either the terms of the agreement or the means to secure fulfilment of any terms whatsoever??

falls into two parts, one routine: correspondence, distribution of members .
.
.
etc.
; the other — congresses: Copenhagen and Zurich.
326 Following the Lon-don Congress one [representative] was [on the I.
S.
B.
] from the Russian Social-Democrats.
The Plenary Meeting also elected Plekhanov, but he refused, saying that one man was enough to do the work.
At the Copenhagen Congress we drew closer together and spoke in a friendly manner; I was no longer able to talk to the Golos people and looked at Trotsky with disapproval, especially over the letter.
327 Towards the end of the sitting, Plekhanov accepted the Plenary Meeting’s proposal.
He and I have one vote.
Until recently we have had no conflicts of any kind.
At Copenhagen I worked on the co-operative commit-tee.
Of most interest are the extremely aggravated rela-tions among the German Social-Democrats: unity on the surface and two different trends beneath.
On behalf of the German Social-Democrats, one half represents the party and the other, the trade unions.
The greater the German delegation numerically, the lower seems the hegemony of the German Social-Democrats to decline.
At Stuttgart they covered themselves with disgrace by voting for the colonial resolution.
.
.
.
One of their representatives, for instance, says that it is impossible to expropriate the capi-talists.
It turns out that in this context their programme says nothing at all about expropriation.
What they are actually conducting is not a Social-Democratic line.
There should be no illusions about this, for as time goes on the struggle is bound to sharpen and grow; of course, the mass of the proletariat will not vacillate.
They staged a walk-out at the Magdeburg Congress, but no Social-Democrat will be intimidated by that kind of thing.
328 There is a split among the Czechs.
329 We were against the split, feeling that the Social-Democrats should not Succumb to any chauvinist or nationalist agitation.
In Austria, there are a great many scandals over the languageto be used in the paper work, etc.
Plekhanov was the rap-porteur on this split, and his resolution was adopted by a large majority.
There again, Trotsky tried his reconcilia-tion, saying that the fault lay with Adler, the most “peaceable” and opportunist Social-Democrat.
The German Social-Democrats are undoubtedly approach-ing a new epoch — the epoch of the socialist revolution.
The economic and military crisis and world complications, all tend to bring out the symptoms of the epoch.
There has been preparatory work so far.
Now it is the epoch of battles against the bourgeoisie.
And that is where the distinction between the reformists and the revolutionary Social-Demo-crats is being realized.
A sitting of the I.
S.
B.
was called at Zurich over Morocco.
There was also an incident there.
Molkenbuhr wrote a letter in his own name suggesting that no sitting should be held.
Rosa Luxemburg published the letter, and that sparked things off.
330 The revolutionary Social-Democrats won out at the last congress.
Bebel said that he would take action against Rosa Luxemburg.
There was an attempt on the part of the French to get the strike written into the resolution as a means of struggle against war.
All the revolutionary Social-Democrats spoke against, arguing that we should not let the government know in advance which weapon we shall take up, and which is most suitable and where.
The proposal was rejected.
Bebel raised the question of non-publication of the documents, hinting at Rosa Luxemburg and demanding a resolution.
I stood up for Rosa Luxemburg.
To Bebel’s great indignation I quot-ed Quelch.
There Bebel acted as a conciliator.
The letter published by Rosa Luxemburg has nothing to do with the [other] documents.
Action in the party was the most that should be done against her, and that was done; it was unfair to take the whole thing to the I.
S.
B.
.
.
.
Various trends have grown up within German Social-Democracy and are bursting to get out; inside, the party is seething.
Resolute action is imminent there.
A conflict between the reformist and the revolutionary Social-Demo-crats is inevitable.

As we have discovered from our exchange of opinion, the workers are paying a great deal of attention to the famine and are actively intervening and helping the starving.
Helping the starving is not philanthropy.
It is philanthropy only with the bourgeois approach.
But that is not all.
The Cadets have really adopted the stand-point of the ministry officials.
We should join the commit-tees which are being set up to fight the famine.
I mean the non-Party workers’ committees.
We should not pre-scribe their establishment but we should take part in them.
The money should best be sent to the Social-Democratic group, the workers’ unions, clubs and other societies.
We should also publish a leaflet, but preferably addressed to the workers and peasants.
We should see to the distribution of the speech by Markov II, who said the starving peasants were idlers.
It is a fine speech and makes good reading.

1 Printed from the original 6 SPEECH ON THE ORGANISATIONAL QUESTION JANUARY 11 (24) 1912 I should like to deal with another aspect of the question.
It is about flexibility.
.
.
.
The resolution was correct.
331 I should like to call attention to which side is important.
Let us take a legal society as an example.
I can’t say this about the whole of Russia, but about 5 towns I can say that .
.
.
it is possible.
And so what does a legal society give us above all? Lectures of a Marxist character: this seems to be permitted.
I see from the press that they are permitted in the big towns.
It is said that lecturers are hard to come by.
.
.
.
The workers themselves should bring out the lecturers and pay them.
Then there are the library and reading room.
I don’t know whether they are allowed to take Zvezda.
Then, legal societies arrange all kinds of entertainment.
That is important from the financial side, and, besides, the entertainment makes it a kind of club.
Now if this type of society is not a fiction, but a reality, and there is no question about that, we should ask ourselves [whether] we have worked to extend such societies.
[Whether] we have given reports about such societies at factories and plants.
Have we tried to organise such societies? Further, how are these societies to be used? We are now almost similar in type to the German organisation in the epoch of the anti-Socialist laws, but for us it is both harder and * This paragraph is crossed out in the MS.
—Ed.
easier.
It is harder because legal possibilities were open to them.
The C.
C.
consisted of members of the parliamentary party group, met legally and invited illegal workers.
For our part, we have a great deal of sympathy in the masses and support for Social-Democracy.
In every society we should have small Social-Democratic cells closely bound up with the Party, deciding on each matter in the spirit of the Party’s resolutions.
.
.
.
These cells should not be as unwieldy as the districts and subdistricts.
St.
Petersburg and Riga fit the [legal] society type.
In Moscow, little was done in this respect.
And so we find these cells allowing a differ-ent type of Party structure.
In the past, in my time, we had to do everything ourselves.
Today, the trade unions and organisations handle some of the work.
Whenever possible, the political struggle is frequently also conducted by the legal Duma group, and if we had more legal societies built on these lines, the revolution would be invincible.
That is the question of the organisations’ flexibility.
It will be the ideal for rebuilding our organisation.
These illegal cells surrounded by a network of legal cells will give us a new basis.
All contacts should be reduced to a minimum, as though the organisation is and is not there.
Let there be no meetings.
Party work has assumed a different form.
The new form has already wedged into the old.
Let it be less formalised but expanding through work in the legal societies.
Every step towards culture should be permeated with the Social-Democratic spirit, with Social-Democratic culture.
.
.
.
This will be a resolute fight against the liquida-tors.
.
.
.
There is a cell, which is connected with the C.
O.
, contacting it once a year and doing a hundred times more than before.
We have not done enough in the legal societies.
We must wrest them from the hands of the liberals, we must [wrest] the entire legal movement.
The legal socie-ties should be spread out and expanded.
Concrete attention should be given to how work is being organised in the legal societies.
Everywhere the illegal cells should be surrounded by a network of legal cells.

3) the text and the character of the petition are unsatis-factory; 4) wresting a partial demand, while the circumstances obtrude generally elementary conditions of freedom [for] the whole people; 5) failure: 1,300 signatures.
No support in Kiev, Yeka-terinoslav, the Caucasus, etc.
; 6) the interest in proletarian meetings has shown that the “[wa]ys” to the masses should be sought not where the liquidators want to.
Sum total: Recognise failure as final.
Petition on the concrete conditions [of the epoch] — one of the least [suitable] means of agitation.
Call to agitation for freedom [of coalition] in connection with general [political] demands and revolutionary agita-tion in the masses.
Draft resolution To recognise: 1) that the [so]-called “petition campaign” was started by a [group of St.
Petersburg writers] of the liquidationist trend, without being a product [of mass struggle], without being connected with active initiative .
.
.
by workers’ organ-isations or forward-looking workers; 2) that the said [campaign in virtue of the character] of the petition, and in virtue of the general political condi-tions, has [inevitably degenerated into a purely formal] and indifferent signing of [a paper] which is of no inter-est to the masses, [without] broad participation by the workers themselves in discussing .
.
.
the petition either in the press or at meetings; 3) that the said petition, circulated and commented upon by the liquidators, advanced an isolated demand for political freedom for one class, the [most] advanced and most revolutionary class, making the demand [outside the general] elementary conditions of political freedom for [the whole people], thereby distorting the tasks in the struggle of the proletariat — [the leader] .
.
.
of the whole people — against tsarism and dooming the “campaign” to [failure]; 4) that the outcome of the [petition campaign] in ques-tion has clearly confirmed that [the whole] scheme waswrong and isolated from [the workers’ mass]: the petition collected only 1,300 signatures, [while] in all the Party organisations, including those [in the Caucasus], Yekateri-noslav and Kiev, and even .
.
.
sympathising with the liqui-dators, the petition campaign, clearly not supported by the [masses], [failed to win] any support at all, just as the [campaign] was given no support [by our Social-Demo-cratic group in the Duma].

Organisation Abroad Printed from the text of the announcementROSA LUXEMBURG AND THE POLISH “PARTEI” VORSTAND IN MARTOV’S WAKE 335 Rosa Luxemburg’s statement in Vorwärts (on September 14) in defence of the so-called Polish Vorstand and carrying charges against Comrade Radek has forced me to take up the pen despite my great unwillingness to interfere in this matter.
I cannot remain silent when the struggle against the liquidators of the Russian Party is being used to vindi-cate the worst methods of the liquidators.
I have personally witnessed Comrade Radek’s vacillation from defence of the extreme Left to defence of the Russian liquidators; I have always fought and will continue to fight politically against all those who defend liquidationism, but that is precisely why I must stand up against the disgust-ing methods used by the so-called Polish Vorstand in the Radek “affair”.
336 What is the principal specific of Martov’s “well-known” (bekannt) pamphlet, of which Rosa Luxemburg makes such opportune mention? 337 It is that Martov, the leader of the liquidators, after all the Social-Democrats of Russia, in January 1910, solemnly and unanimously accepted the condemnation of liquidationism and after peace in the Party was proclaimed on the basis of this condemnation 338 — a year later, when the liquidators destroyed the Party’s C.
C.
and split away from the Party — Martov put out a pamphlet accusing his oppo-nents of 1,001 dishonest and criminal offences.
At the time the Poles called this pamphlet a “stinkbomb”, and even (sogar, and not selbst) Kautsky called it “abscheulich”.
* The very same thing has now been done by the so-called Polish Vorstand with Rosa Luxemburg at its head.
Comrade Radek was recommended t o m e p e r s o n a l l y, in 1909 and 1910, as a fitting c o l l a b o r a t o r f o r o u r Party’s C.
O.
and was personally introduced to me, with the best of references, at the International Congress at Copen-hagen, by the selfsame members of this very Vorstand.
But then, in 1911, Comrade Radek took a political stand against this Vorstand, supporting the Party’s Warsaw * Disgusting, foul.
—Ed.
Committee, a number of Party members and two of its prominent leaders (Malecki and Hanecki), who exposed the Vorstand for disorganising activity.
Comrade Radek helped to establish the truth, namely, that the Polish Parteivorstand is a Vorstand without a party.
In Warsaw, the capital of Poland, this Vorstand no longer represents the Warsaw Committee, but its own fictitious little group.
The German comrades will soon learn about all this in greater detail.
Members of the Russian Social-Democratic Party are aware that there is already a whole literature about it, and it is futile on Rosa Luxemburg’s part to hush it up (totzuschweigen) before the International! After Radek took his political stand against the so-called Parteivorstand (without a party), this “Partei”vorstand cooked up a “trial” against Radek over a “case” — listen to this! — dating back to 1 9 0 6 ! That is the crux of the matter, and that is what our illustre * Rosa has been trying wegzuschwatzen! ** Rosa Luxemburg and her “Partei ” vorstand are currently conducting an unprecedentedly fierce fight against their own party’s best workers, stooping so low as to throw out suspicions of their connection with the secret police.
Rosa Luxemburg and her “Partei”vorstand have lost their head waging such a war against their political opponents.
Is it not now clear why, without going into the substance of the “Radek affair”, I consider it to be my duty to declare that the substance of the case is political revenge by Rosa Luxemburg and her “Partei”vorstand? Certain methods were described in Russian literature by Turgenev long ago.
One old rascal, he wrote, once gave this wise advice: when doing something base, see that you shout loudest about the baseness of the acts you are yourself committing.
When robbing the public till, be sure to shout loudest about the vileness of embezzlement.
.
.
.
When the Polish “Partei”vorstand stooped to a repetition of Martov’s methods against Comrade Radek — the “Partei”-(v)orstand got Rosa Luxemburg to raise the greatest possible noise in Vorwärts about Martov’s baseness!.

Rosa Luxemburg has been trying to assure her German readers that Comrade Radek “nie die geringste Rolle gespielt hat”, *** and so on, and so forth.
It is my duty to reply to this elenden Altweiberklatsch * * * * and state the precise facts: in 1909 and 1910, Comrade Radek did a great deal of successful work as a contributor to the Central Organ of the Social-Democratic Party of Russia.
I was one of the editors of the Central Organ and I cannot let Rosa Luxemburg’s malicious bit of gossip go unanswered.
In order to denigrate Comrade Radek, Rosa Luxemburg praises herself under the name of “polnische Wortfüh-rer”.
* * * * * She puts out a hint that Comrade Radek’s “taktischen Ideen” * ) are tenuous.
Let me say right away that I consider this tenuousness, this readiness to have “peace” with the Russian liquidators, Comrade Radek’s great sin.
But I believe it is more excus-able in a collaborator who is not responsible for C.

by the liquidators, the Poles remained in that institution for months together with the Bundists and the Latvians, 339 of whom even (sogar) Plekhanov wrote: “Diese Parteiinstitution, die zum Werkzeug in den Händen einer Gruppe von Leuten geworden war, die die Partei liquidieren wollten und die daher der Sache des russischen Proletariats grossen Schaden zuzufügen drohte, konnte diesem nur einen Gefallen erweisen: nämlich das Zeitliche segnen” (Note: “Tagebuch eines S.

* On the strength of these facts, the reader will judge whether there is a great deal of truth in Rosa Luxemburg’s boastful words to the effect that the Poles “mit starker Faust die liquidatorische Richtung in Russland niederzu-halten geholfen haben”.
** In actual fact, by their intrigues the Poles did much more to hinder the struggle against this “Richtung” * * * .
Up to now, eight months after the formal expulsion of a definite group of liquidators from the Party (the magazine Nasha Zarya), 340 the notorious “polnische Wortführer” have been unable to give a straightforward answer as to whether or not they want “peace” with this group.
It is, of course, not as easy to give a straightforward answer as to plagiarise the anti-liquidators today and the liquidators tomorrow, declar-* “This party institution, which became a tool in the hands of gentlemen intent on liquidating the party, and which in consequence threatened to inflict great damage on the cause of Russian Social-Democracy, could do the revolutionary proletariat only one good service: suffer a timely demise” (Note: Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata, Second Supplement to No.

ing oneself, on the strength of that, to be “superior” to both “factions”! Rosa Luxemburg takes the occasion of the “Radek case” to assure her German readers that nothing “ausser Trüm-mern”* is left of the “russische Partei”.
** In response to that I must state the actual facts.
It is the Polish “Partei”vorstand that is the “Trümmer”, because it has not belonged to the Party for a whole year.
For a whole year, it has not had any organisational ties either with the Party C.
C.
, which was elected by the January 1912 Confer-ence, 341 or with the so-called “Organising Committee” of the liquidators.
The Party of the Russian Social-Democratic proletariat, which has divested itself of the liquidators and the intri-guers of the Polish “Partei”vorstand, is so far from being Trümmer that it has been developing with especial success since January 1912.
Since some — and at times, regrettably, influential — comrades in the German party lend an ear to the frequently biased stories and Klatsch of the Wortfüh-rer des polnischen “Partei”vorstandes, who are outside the Party, I shall confine myself to a brief indication of the facts.
Legal Marxist newspapers are the only open measure (Maßstab) of the Social-Democrats’ influence in Russia and their ties with the workers’ masses.
Only two “trends” — the Party and the liquidators — are represented in Russia.
All the rest are a Schwindel.
*** In the first half of 1912, the liquidators put out 21 issues of their paper and the anti-liquidators, 100.
In the two months of the second half-year (July and August) the former had 4, and the latter —60.
In the eight months (from January to August 1912) the former were able to report direct assist-ance to them from 16 workers’ groups, and the latter — from 551.

Part 3 Printed from the original REPLY TO LIQUIDATORS’ ARTICLE IN L E I P Z I G E R V O L K S Z E I T U N G 342 A note on “a conference of organisations of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party ” appeared in No.
226 of Volkszeitung * on September 28, but is regrettably based on one-sided and unverified facts.
We consider it necessary to point out that the said con-ference was actually in no sense a conference of Russian Party organisations.
Russian workers’ centres were not represented at the conference at all.
St.
Petersburg was represented by the liquidators from the so-called promotion group 343 who do not belong to the Social-Democratic Party and have been fighting it fiercely in their magazine and newspaper.
344 Moscow was represented only by a delegate from an insignificant section of the Party organisation, and he had been given an imperative mandate to conduct the political line of the Party Conference held in January 1912.
The rest of Russia (Kiev, Yekaterinoslav, Kharkov, the Volga and Ural regions, the Central Industrial Area, the Don district and many others) was not represented at all, apart from Krasnoyarsk and Sevastopol, but it was only from the liquidators’ magazines and the report about the “conference ” that the Party learned of there being any sort of organisation in either city.
For a long time it has of course been no secret to the * Leipziger Volkszeitung.
—Ed.
Party that a group of liquidators has been trying to call a conference with the assistance of the Bund, which has essentially nothing to do with actual Russian Social-Demo-cratic activity.
(For the information of German readers let us add that when we speak about Russian Party work the Bund is not included because its sphere of activity is con-fined exclusively to the Jewish proletariat.
) However, the real character of this attempt was so clear that Comrade Plekhanov replied to the invitation to attend the “confer-ence” that he would not do so not only because he regarded the “conference” as being one-sided, but also because it was not attended either by the “Party elements” or by the “anti-Party elements”.
That is exactly what was said in the report published by the Organising Committee of the liquidators’ conference in September 1912.
But these words of the neutral Comrade Plekhanov are not in the German report carried in No.
226 of Volkszeitung on September 28 inst.
We put it now to every German comrade whether this report can be considered honest.
Even from the groups abroad which gave their formal consent to the convocation of a conference together with the liquidators, the former deputy of the Second Duma, Alexinsky, representing the Vperyod group, left it as a sign of open opposition to the liquidators’ party conference, because he did not regard it as a valid party conference.
It is our duty, however briefly, also to point out the following: In the six months (from January 1 to June 30, 1912), the anti-liquidators’ newspapers in St.
Petersburg, Zvezda and Pravda, united 550 workers’ groups as against the liquidators’ 16.
Upon its appearance, the latter’s new paper, Luch, 345 was given a hostile reception by the St.
Petersburg workers, who saw it as an attempt to split the Party.
The liquidators were roundly defeated in the election of workers’ representatives to the Duma (elections to the workers’ curia of the Duma) on September 16 (29).
Despite its use of all the means of advertising, the group which had called this private conference of liquidators fighting against the Party, failed to mislead the Russian organisations.
It is now making spasmodic efforts through the same adver-tising channels to misinform the German comrades, at least.
We most resolutely protest against this, and point out that the liquidators’ anonymous information will continue to mislead the German comrades until they demand that the “informers” should make a public stand under their own names and with proof in their hands.

1 1 1 Printed from the Leipziger Volkszeitung text Translated from the German RUSSIAN SOCIAL -DEMOCRATIC LABOUR PARTY Proletarians of all countries, unite! TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA 346 Comrades workers and all citizens of Russia! A war of four powers against Turkey has started in the Balkans.
347 War threatens the whole of Europe.
Despite their lying government denials, Russia and Austria are preparing for war.
Italy is becoming more brazen in her policy of plundering the Turkish lands.
The stock-market panic in Vienna and Berlin, in Paris and London shows that the capitalists of all Europe see no possibility of preserving European peace.
All Europe wants to take part in the events in the Balkans! Everyone favours “reforms” and even “freedom for the Slavs”.
Actually, Russia wants to snatch a piece of Turkey in Asia and to seize the Bosporus.
Austria has designs on Salonika, Italy on Albania, Britain on Arabia, and Germany on Anatolia.
The crisis is mounting.
Hundreds of thousands and mil-lions of wage slaves of capital and peasants downtrodden by the serf-owners are going to the slaughter for the dynastic interests of a handful of crowned brigands, for the profits of the bourgeoisie in its drive to plunder foreign lands.
The Balkan crisis is a link in the chain of events which since the turn of the century has everywhere been leading to sharper class and international contradictions, to wars and revolutions.
The Russo-Japanese war, the revolution in Russia, a series of revolutions in Asia, mounting rivalry and hostility between the European states, the threat to peace over Morocco, and Italy’s plunderous campaign against Tripoli — such has been the preparation of the current crisis.
Wars and all their calamities are produced by capitalism, which keeps millions of working people in bondage, sharpens the struggle between nations, and turns the slaves of capital into cannon fodder.
A world-wide socialist army of the revolutionary proletariat is alone capable of putting an end to this oppression and enslavement of the masses and to these massacres of slaves in the interests of the slave-owners.
In Western Europe and America, there is a sharpening struggle by the socialist proletariat against imperialist bourgeois governments, who are increasingly inclined to plunge into desperate escapades as they see the working-class millions inexorably marching to victory.
These govern-ments are preparing war but at the same time are afraid of war in the knowledge that world-wide war means world-wide revolution.
In Eastern Europe — the Balkans, Austria and Russia — alongside areas of highly developed capitalism, we find the masses oppressed by feudalism, absolutism and thousands of medieval relics.
Like tens of millions of peasants in Central Russia, the peasants in Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the Adriatic coast, are still ground down by the land-owning serf-masters.
The piratical dynasties of the Hapsburgs and the Romanovs support this medieval oppression and try to stoke up hostility between the peoples in an effort to strengthen the power of the monarchy and perpetuate the enslavement of a number of nationalities.
In Eastern Eu-rope, the monarchs still share out the peoples between them, exchange and trade in them, putting together different nationalities into patchwork states to promote their own dynastic interests, very much as the landowners under the serf system used to break up and shuffle the families of their subject peasants!A federal Balkan republic is the rallying cry that our brother socialists in the Balkan countries have issued to the masses in their struggle for self-determination and complete freedom of the peoples, to clear the way for a broad class struggle for socialism.
It is the rallying cry of true democrats and real friends of the working class and we must take it up with especial vigour in face of the Russian tsarist monarchy, one of the most vicious supporters of reaction throughout the world.
The foreign policy of Russian tsarism is an unbroken chain of unprecedented crimes and acts of violence, and the dirtiest and basest intrigues against the freedom of nations, against democracy and against the working class.
With the aid of Britain’s “liberal” rulers, tsarism is crushing and choking Persia; tsarism has been undermining the republic in China; tsarism is sneaking up to seize the Bosporus and extend “its” own territory at the expense of Turkey in Asia.
The tsarist monarchy was the gendarme of Europe in the 19th century, when Russian serf-peasant troops put down the uprising in Hungary.
Today, in the 20th century, the tsarist monarchy is the gendarme of both Europe and Asia.
Tsar Nicholas the Bloody, who has dispersed the First and Second Dumas, who has drowned Russia in blood, enslaved Poland and Finland, and is in alliance with out-and-out reactionaries conducting a policy of stifling the Jews and all “aliens”, the tsar whose loyal friends shot down the workers on the Lena and ruined the peasants to the point of starvation all over Russia — that tsar pretends to be the champion of Slav independence and freedom! Since 1877, the Russian people have learned a thing or two, and they are now aware that worse than all the Turks are our “internal Turks”—the tsar and his servants.
But the landowners and the bourgeoisie, the Nationalists and the Octobrists give their utmost support to this vile and provocative lie about a freedom-loving tsarism.
Such papers as Golos Moskvy 348 and Novoye Vremya are at the head of a whole army of government newspapers brazenly baiting and badgering Austria, as though Russian tsarism was not a hundred times more sullied in dirt and blood than the Hapsburg monarchy.
And it is not only the Right-wing parties, but even the opposition, liberal bourgeoisie that has been strident in its chauvinistic imperialist propaganda, scarcely covered up with diplomatically evasive and hypocritical phrases.
Not only the non-party liberal Russkoye Slovo, 349 but even Rech, the official organ of the Party of “Constitutional-Democrats” (actually counter-revolutionary liberals), has been zealous in attacking the tsarist Minister Sazonov for his alleged “tractability”, for his “concessions” to Austria and for inadequate “protection” of Russia’s “great power” interests.
The Cadets have been blaming the wildest national-ist reactionaries not for their imperialism, but on the contrary for minimising the weight and the importance of the “great” idea of the tsarist conquest of Constantinople!! For the sake of the vital interests of all the working peo-ple, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party raises its voice in resolute protest against this base chauvinism and brands it as a betrayal of the cause of freedom.
A country with 30 million starving peasants and with the wildest arbitrary rule by the authorities, including the shooting of workers in their hundreds a country where tens of thousands of fighters for freedom are being tormented and tortured through hard labour — what such a country needs above all is liberation from tsarist oppression.
The Russian peasant must think about emancipating himself from the landowning serf-masters and from the tsarist monarchy, and not allow himself to be diverted from this vital cause by the false speeches of landowners and merchants about Russia’s “Slavonic tasks”.
Imperialist liberalism, desirous of tolerating tsarism, may insist on “peaceful constitutional” action, promising the people both external victories and constitutional reforms under a preserved tsarist monarchy, but the Social Democratic proletariat indignantly rejects this fraud.
The only thing that can ensure free development for Russia and the whole of Eastern Europe is the revolutionary over-throw of tsarism.
Only the victory of a federal republic in the Balkans, together with the victory of a republic in Russia, can release hundreds of millions of people from the calamities of war and the torments of oppression and exploi-tation in the so-called “time of peace ”.
In the first five months of 1912, more than 500,000 workers in Russia rose to political strikes, restoring their strength after the most trying years of the counter-revolution.
In some places, sailors and soldiers rose up in revolt against tsarism.
Our call is for revolutionary mass struggle, for more steadfast, stable and extensive preparation for resolute joint action by the workers, peasants and the best section of the army! That is the only salvation for Russia, which has been oppressed and ruined by tsarism.
The socialists of the Balkan countries have come out with a sharp condemnation of the war.
The socialists of Italy and Austria and the whole of Western Europe have given them unanimous support.
Let us join in their protest and unfold our agitation against the tsarist monarchy.
Down with the tsarist monarchy! Long live the democratic republic of Russia! Long live the federal republic of the Balkans! Down with war! Down with capitalism! Long live socialism, long live international revolutionary Social-Democracy! R.

Central Committee Written before October 1 0 (2 3 ), 1 9 1 2 Published in October 1 9 1 2 as a separate leaflet Printed from the text of the leaflet ON POLITICAL SPINELESSNESS ( LETTER TO THE EDITOR ) As a regular reader of Pravda, 350 I feel bound to express my deep indignation over the behaviour of the elector P.
Sudakov The elections take place on October 5.
Sudakov is not on Pravda’s list.
None the less, Sudakov is returned by the votes of its supporters — as the results of the elections show.
It is also evident that apart from the votes of Pravda’s supporters (27-31 out of 50) Sudakov also receives a dozen or so votes from someone else, possibly vacillating voters.
And so Sudakov himself starts vacillating.
The day after the election, October 6, Pravda carries his report which says, in black and white, the following: “All those elected,with the exception of Comrade Petrov, belong to the support-ers of Pravda and Zvezda.
” That’s clear, isn’t it? But within 24 hours, Sudakov puts in an appearance in Luch! Sudakov admits that he has been to Pravda’s editorial office but, he says, “only as the editorial office of a Social-Democratic newspaper”!! I wonder if this Sudakov isn’t a babe-in-arms.
Who is going to believe him that he knew nothing about the two Social-Democratic papers? That he did not know about the liquidators, when he himself under-stands the liquidators? “If I did say,” Sudakov writes in the liquidationist Luch, “that I read Pravda and side with it” (please note Sudakov declaring that he sides with Pravda!), “it was only in the sense” (sic) “that I do in general” (sic) “side” (is that all?) “with the Social-Democrats.
” What is one to make of all this! Here is a man who is aware of the existence of the two papers, admitting that he did say that he “sided with Pravda”, and who the next day takes a “senatorial explanation” to the liquidationist news-paper, merely in the sense that he allegedly sides with the Social-Democrats in general!! We are not aware of a more crying instance of spinelessness and vacillation.
There have always been “Tushino turncoats” 351— deserters from one trend to another — but turncoats have never had the respect of the workers.
Pravda No.
1 4 5 , October 1 7 , 1 9 1 2 Signed: R e g u l a r r e a d e r o f “P r a v d a” Printed from the Pravda text REPORT TO THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST BUREAU, “ELECTIONS TO THE FOURTH DUMA” 352 The coup of June 3 (16), 1907, opened the epoch of counter-revolution in Russia.
Everyone knows about the judicial and administrative lawlessness, the persecutions and tortures of those condemned to penal servitude that crowned this triumph of tsarism.
The upper sections of the bourgeoisie, terrified by the revolution, supported the counter-revolutionary gentry.
Tsarism was sure that it would find support and assistance among the counter-revolutionary elements of the bourgeoisie and landowners.
The electoral law of June 3 (16), 1907, is a specimen of barefaced rigging.
Here are some data characterising it: The population is divided into “curias”: landowners, first-and second-category urban dwellers, peasants, Cossacks and workers.
Electors, elected separately by curias (some-times not directly, but through representatives), are grouped by the government into gubernia electoral assemblies, and the latter elect the deputies to the Duma.
The law distributes the electors in such a way that in the electoral assemblies of 28 gubernias (out of 50) only the landowners are assured of a majority in advance, and in the rest — the electors of the first urban curia (big capitalists).
Here is the overall picture: 200,000 gentry have 2,594 electors in the electoral assemblies of 53 gubernias, that is, 49.
4 per cent of the total number of electors; 500,000 or so capitalists of the first urban curia have 788 electors (15 per cent); almost 8 million townsfolk of the second urban curia have 590 electors (11.
2 per cent); nearly 70 million peasants and Cossacks have 1,168 electors (22.
2 per cent); and nearly 12 million workers — 112 electors (2.
1 per cent).
No wonder this electoral law has produced a “black” counter-revolutionary Duma — a real “Chambre introuvab-le”.
353 What is surprising is that not only bourgeois liberals, but even Social-Democrats have managed to get their representatives into such a Duma.
In the workers’ curia, all electors are Social-Democrats.
The ultra-reactionary gentry, with a majority in the gubernia electoral assemblies, have been forced to let in the Social-Democrats (in six gubernias, the law stipulates the election of one deputy from the workers; in other gubernias, the Social-Democrats obtain mandates through agreements with the liberals).
The Third Duma was dominated by the Octobrist Party — a party of the reactionary gentry and big capitalists subser-vient to tsarism.
But even these “slaves” failed to satisfy the Nicholas II camarilla, this black band of brigands organising pogroms and attempts on the life of opposition deputies.
The government, which rigged the elections to get the Octobrists into the Third Duma, has now falsified the elections to get the more “loyal” parties — the “Nationalists” and “extreme Rightists” — into the Fourth Duma.
The pressure has been unprecedented.
The priests have been ordered to take massive part in the elections and get the Rightists in; the arrests of the opposition candidates, the fines imposed on the press, the closure of newspapers, the dropping of suspects from the electoral rolls — all that was applied, with such cynicism that even the Rightists and even the gentry were impelled to protest.
As a result, we have an even “blacker” and even more Rightist Duma, but it is the Octobrists that today turn out to be the defeated party.
The liberal opposition and revolu-tionary democracy (Social-Democratic workers and peasant bourgeois democrats) have almost managed to retain the status quo.

437 438 Let us add a few words to explain the names and groupings of the parties: Social-Democrats: the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
Trudoviks: peasant democrats, i.
e.
, revolutionarybourgeois democrats, whose programme includes the expropriation of the gentry.
Cadets: the Constitutional-Democratic Party, actually a counter-revolutionary liberal bourgeois party.
Progressists 354 : the same liberals, but slightly more moderate.
Poles and Moslems —the same thing, but on national lines.
Altogether the opposition consists of 25 democrats and 113 liberals, or 138 deputies (142 in the Third Duma).
Government parties: the Octobrists speak of the constitu-tion rarely and under their breath; the Nationalists never speak of the constitution.
The Rightists openly favour a return to autocracy and oppose the constitution.
Not only the Octobrists, but even a section of the Nationalists have been impelled towards the opposition by the election rigging.
As for the Social-Democrats, the following have been elected by this time: Six deputies from the workers’ curia are Social-Democrats: Badayev from St.
Petersburg; Malinovsky from Moscow; Samoilov from Vladimir; Shagov from Kostroma; Muranov from Kharkov; and Petrovsky from Yekaterinoslav.
All six are workers.
Then Social-Democrats have also been returned in three gubernias through agreement between democrats (socialists and Trudoviks) and liberals against the Rightists.
Returned in this manner were: Khaustov from Ufa; Buryanov from Taurida Gubernia; Tulyakov from the Don Region.
Then three Social-Democrats were returned from the Caucasus: Chkheidze, Chkhenkeli and Skobelev, the latter being elected by the Russian population of the Caucasus.
Two Social-Democrats were returned from Siberia: Rusa-nov and, from the Amur Region, Ryslev.
Let us add, too, that the election of one Social-Democrat from Irkutsk Gubernia (Siberia) was virtually assured (11 electors out of 20 were Social-Democrats).
However, the governor has declared the election of six Social-Democrats in the city of Irkutsk invalid.
The elections have not yet been held.
It is also necessary to add that in Warsaw, as a result of a bloc between the Bund and the P.
P.
S.
, Jagiello, a member of the Polish Socialist Party, 355 was elected deputy.
All these data are preliminary.
The full composition of all the groups of the Fourth Duma, including the Social-Democratic group, will become known after the Duma opens on November 15 (28).

1905 -1914, Paris Translated from the French MORE ABOUT THE PEASANT DEPUTIES IN THE FOURTH DUMA Novoye Vremya recently reported the final organisation of a separate peasant group in the Fourth Duma.
The report says that it consists of 40 men.
The group’s bureau consists of Yevseyev, Karaulov, Ichas, Firsov and Mershchy.
“Karaulov (a Cossack),” wrote Novoye Vremya, “is said to be one of the most vigorous men in the new group; he drew public attention by his original definition of party affiliation in the form which members of the Duma are asked to fill in by the magistrate office.
In the ‘par-ty affiliation’ column Karaulov wrote: ‘I do not belong to any party or faction.
I am what every man who truly loves his country must be: I am a monarchist-democrat.
’” Can we accept that such a definition of party affiliation is “original”? Yes and no.
Yes, considering that Karaulov has frankly expressed what many are afraid to say.
No, because in point of fact Deputy Karaulov’s opinion is notoriously shared by a very considerable number of peasants and Cossacks.
Incidentally, Deputy Karaulov believes that “every man who truly loves his country” must be a democrat.
Deputy Karaulov is clearly mistaken.
Let him look at all the Right-wing half or even the Right-wing two-thirds of the Duma: can he truly say that among all these “Rightists” — from “Nationalists” to Octobrists — there is no one “who truly loves his country”? Karaulov must concede that there probably is.
But it is quite obvious that the Rightists, and the National-ists, and the Octobrists (and, honestly speaking, the Cadets as well) are n o t “democrats”.
They are all monarchists, that is beyond question, but they are not democrats.
They either do not at all favour a democratic electoral law, democratic laws on the press, on association and assembly, democratic distribution of landed property, or talk their way out of the serious prob-lems of democracy.
What then is to be done? Is it not clear that the landown-ers, for instance, take a different view of “true love for the country” than the peasants, although both may be monarch-ists? The work of the Fourth Duma will surely make Karaulov and men like him give serious thought to this.

CENTRAL COMMITTEE WITH PARTY FUNCTIONARIES 356 ON THE REORGANISATION AND WORK OF THE PRAVDA EDITORIAL BOARD 1.
The Editorial Board lacks consistency of Party prin-ciple.
The Editorial Board is strongly advised to see to the stricter observance and implementation of all Party deci-sions.
Its proceedings must be conducted on legal lines.
The C.
C.
is taking steps to reorganise the Editorial Board.
2.
The Editorial Board has failed to provide the necessary response to Party life among Social-Democratic workers in St.
Petersburg.
Reports or mention of Party resolutions must be unconditionally legal in form.
3.
The Editorial Board must give more attention to explaining the error and harm of liquidationism in general and of the sermons of Luck in particular.
4.
The Editorial Board must give more attention to campaigning for subscriptions and collections among the workers.
5.
The Bolshevik section of the deputies must take part in the paper’s broad editorial collegium and organise systematic and persistent participation in the literary and economic side of the business.
6.
The Editorial Board must be especially circumspect in its attitude to its Vperyod contributors to avoid hampering the rapprochement that has begun and to prevent the adop-tion of an erroneous principled line.
7.
Every effort must be made to reduce publishing costs and to set up a small governing collegium (running the whole business) on which there must be at least one representative of the Six.
357 There is need for a similar governing collegium (economic commission) on which one of the Six must be seated, to handle the economic side of the business.
8.
Articles which the C.
C.
considers obligatory for inser-tion must be carried immediately (under a code name).
358 9.
While strictly maintaining the newspaper’s legal character, it is necessary to recruit for active participation both in literary work on the newspaper and in its distri-bution workers’ societies, leagues, committees, groups and individuals in St.
Petersburg and in the provinces.
10.
Support should be given to the initiative of the group of St.
Petersburg Social-Democrats in the publication of a general trade union organ of anti-liquidationist orienta-tion, carefully verifying what is being done on the spot.
11.
Measures must be taken to bring the literary and the economic side of the newspaper and the magazine 359 closer together.
12.
The starting of a daily workers’ newspaper in Moscow as a branch of the St.
Petersburg paper must be vigorously pursued.
With this end in view, organisational connections should be established between the Moscow group and the three deputies of the Moscow Region.

Krupskaya’s handLETTER TO THE EXECUTIVE OF THE GERMAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY 360 Dear Comrades! On the proposal of the Central Committee, the conference of representatives of the C.
C.
and local workers in Russia operating in various branches of Social-Democratic activity, has discussed your letter of December 28, 1912, stating your desire to “call a conference and direct debates”.
While expressing gratitude for your attention to our Party affairs, the conference has unanimously decided to reject your proposal.
We Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats have very great respect for the party of the German revolutionary proletariat.
We want the most fraternal relations to exist between the Russian and the German Social-Democratic parties.
Being unwilling, therefore, to leave any misunder-standing, we shall try to make a frank statement to you, dear comrades, of the motives by which we were guided in rejecting your proposal.
Let us start, for instance, with the aim of your projected conference.
You believe that it should have the aim “to work out a common party programme and organisational rules,” and invite us to inform you of our draft for the one and the other.
But our Party has had a Party programme for a long time.
Back in 1903, i.
e.
, ten years ago, our programme was approved by our Party’s Second Congress.
Since then hun-dreds of thousands, and in the revolutionary years, millions of proletarians in Russia have proved their loyalty to this programme by fighting under our Party’s standard.
We remain true to this programme today.
We believe its revi-sion to be quite superfluous.
For your information we wish to tell you that up to now not even the liquidators have demanded any revision of the Party programme —at any rate they have not done so openly.
Efforts to reach agreement by different groups and group-ings concerning a new programme imply the absence of a party.
But the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
is there, and the working classof Russia continues to struggle under its standard.
Our Party has faced and partially still faces some very hard times.
But it has not ceased to exist for a single minute — contrary to the liquidators’ assertions.
Only the latter (i.
e.
, men outside the Party) will find acceptable any nego-tiations on working out some new Party programme — apparently for some new party.
(What has been said applies, with slight modifications, to the working out of a new set of Party rules.
) Furthermore, we are divided from the liquidators by profound differences of principle — above all on the question of another revolution in Russia.
Our Party (including the pro-Party Mensheviks, with G.
V.
Plekhanov at their head) takes the stand that the working class of Russia and its Party must work for a new revolution in Russia which alone could bring our country true political freedom.
That is precisely what the liquidators deny.
All their tactics are based on the assumption that development in Russia will take a more or less peaceful constitutional way.
You will easily understand, dear comrades, that from these cardinal differences inevitably flows a series of contra-dictions on all questions of Party work.
The liquidators repudiate our present R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, which can now exist only illegally (although it is capable of conducting and does conduct legal Social-Democratic work in many branches).
The liquidators have been trying to wreck our present organ-isation in the hope of establishing a legal labour party in present-day Russia.
(Let us note here that even the liberal Cadets have been unable to secure legal status for their party.
) Hence the split, which is entirely and exclusively the work of the liquidators.
Very naturally these disputes, these cardinal differences can be resolved o n l y by the conscious Russian workers themselves, only by our own Russian Social-Democratic organisations and no one else.
In fact, the Russian workers have already taken a long step in that direction.
The recent election to the Fourth Duma has shown that the Russian proletariat is overwhelmingly behind the standpoint taken by our old Party with its revolutionary programme and tactics.
All six deputies elected under the law from the workers’ curia are Bolsheviks.
These six deputies represent nine-tenths of working-class Russia and they have openly declared themselves to be opposed to the liquidators.
Russia’s first working-class Social-Democratic daily (the St.
Petersburg Pravda) was founded and is kept going by the workers themselves, on the pennies of the workers, namely, workers belonging to the same (Bolshevik) trend.
Consequently, the unity of the vast majority of workers is being created in action, at the grass roots, in the depths of the working mass.
That is the only unity that is vital, and it alone will lead to the complete cohesion of the workers’ forces.
We shall not conceal from you, comrades, that in the given circumstances we regard mediation by the German Parteivorstand * as being altogether unacceptable.
Either for lack of information or for some other reason, the Vorstand has not displayed impartiality in respect of the liquidators and us.
Let us recall at least these two facts.
1) The Central Organ of the fraternal German Party (Vorwärts) 361 gets aside whole columns for gross attacks by the liquidators on our January 1912 Party Conference, whereas we are being denied the opportunity of inserting even a purely factual refutation, which is a violation of the most elementary duties in respect of us.
2) During the election campaign, the Vorstand, despite our protests, gave cash assistance to the liquidators, but denied it to the Central Committee.
The Vorstand gave a subsidy to the Bund, to the Caucasian Regional Commit-tee 362 and the Latvians, i.
e.
, the liquidator O.
C.
, 363 because everyone knows that it is these three organisations that mainly constitute the liquidator O.
C.
And the liquidators used the German workers’ money to start their publication of a Konkurrenzorgan ** Luch in St.
Petersburg, whose first issue appeared on the very day of the election and helped to aggravate the split.
To give cash assistance to one side against the other during a split is a step absolutely unheard of throughout the Inter-* Party Executive.

** Rival organ.

national.
Having taken such a step, the Vorstand issued a challenge to the supporters of the January Conference and showed that it was unable to remain impartial.
It is with deep regret that we must frankly tell you, comrades, that the German comrades’ supply of informa-tion concerning Russian affairs is thoroughly defective.
This also explains your various proposals, such as a con-ference of 12 “trends” (small semi-student groups abroad), ignoring the organisations in Russia, or the plan to call together five organisations, etc.
This also explains the bare-faced attempts on the part of the liquidators simply to deceive you: for example, their attempt to obtain money from you on the strength of the allegation that in the summer of 1912 the Bolsheviks of Kharkov and Moscow united with the liquidators.
Actually, however, it is in Kharkov and Moscow that Bolsheviks, implacable opponents of liquida-tionism (deputies Muranov and Malinovsky), were elected, and they were elected in the struggle with the latter.
This also explains why during the elections you gave cash aid to the groups (the Bund, P.
P.
S.
, P.
S.
D.
364 ) which clashed sharpest at the election and which produced from their midst Jagiello, the only deputy not to be accepted as a full-fledged member of the Social-Democratic group, and who was admitted by the slimmest majority of 7 votes to 6.
It is high time, comrades, to put an end to all this.
Instead of listening to incompetent informants, you must open the pages of your organs for an objective explanation of the state of affairs in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party and for its illumination in the light of principle, namely, for articles signed by responsible spokesmen of the several Party groups.
If you want to know about our affairs, you must draw your information about them from documents and literature, as you do, for instance, in following the struggle of various trends in Italy, Britain, etc.
Otherwise, you will unwittingly take steps which may frequently be seen by Russian work-ers as a quite undeserved affront.

6 Printed from a typewritten copy Translated from the GermanP R A V D A’S ANNIVERSARY ( WORKERS’ SUPPORT FOR THE WORKING -CLASS NEWSPAPER ) A year has passed since the appearance of Pravda’s first issue.
It originated as a workers’ newspaper, created by the celebrated upswing of the working-class movement in Russia in April and May 1912.
Pravda has withstood incredible hardships and harassments and has consolidated its positions (insofar as a workers’ newspaper can be “consolidated” in modern Russia) through the support of the working class.
Pravda has been more than a workers’ newspaper in name: any newspaper can adopt a name.
Pravda has been a workers’ newspaper in fact, in its orientation, in its range of readers from the working mass, and in its content in general, notably the mass of; reports from the workers (1,783 workers’ reports in the first 99 issues; a total of almost 5,000), and, finally, in the support “Pravda” has been given by workers in general and by workers’ groups in particular.
Earlier on we pointed out in Pravda (see Nos.
80 and 103 for 1912) * the exceptional importance of the data on support for Pravda through cash contributions by workers’ groups.
Their importance goes well beyond the framework of finan-cial assistance, although workers’ financial assistance is extremely important and necessary to improve the newspaper at all times.
But contributions from workers’ groups are equally, if not more, important in their moral, educational and organ-isational significance for all class-conscious workers and for the working class of Russia as a whole.
By developing the habit of giving regular support for their own working-class newspaper not only through sub-scriptions and distribution but also through regular contri-butions, the workers are rallied even closer around a newspa-per of their own trend, the workers are organised into some-thing ideologically coherent, the workers verify the progress * See present edition, Vol.
18, pp.
187-202 and 299-301.
—Ed.
of their awakening as they read reports about the contribu-tions at a neighbouring factory or one they know of.
It is, therefore, impossible to over-emphasise the need to extend and develop in every possible way the custom of regular (it is better to have them small but regular) contributions and collections by groups of workers for the workers’ news-paper.
The published reports showed that before Pravda came out over 4,000 rubles had been collected and sent in through the newspaper Zvezda by 500 workers’ groups.
From the day of our paper’s first issue up to April 10, contributions totalling 3,932 rubles 42 kopeks were received, only accord-ing to reports published in Pravda.
Of them, 79.
9 per cent came from proletarians of various categories, 20 per cent from various groups of intellectuals, and 0.
1 per cent from the peasants.
By districts the total is distributed as follows: St.
Petersburg — 66.
3 per cent (2,605 rubles 81 kopeks), of which only 10 per cent falls to the intelligentsia; Moscow, Vladimir and Kostroma — 4.
6 per cent, of which contribu-tions from the intelligentsia occur only in Moscow District (Let us explain at this point that apart from other reasons, these three districts showed small participation in collections for Pravda because they also made collections for the Moscow paper.
365 The money sent only through our newspaper comes to more than 2,000 rubles, of which 70 per cent falls to these three districts and 25 per cent to St.
Petersburg District.
Once again the St.
Petersburg workers showed their politi-cal maturity: they also took an active part in setting up the Moscow newspaper); the Urals, Siberia, the Baltic Area and Poland — 10.
3 per cent; Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav districts — 4.
4 per cent; elsewhere (Finland, Western Europe, etc.
) — 14.
5 per cent.
These figures are sufficiently eloquent evidence of who is the owner of the newspaper, who has kept Pravda going and how intimately it is connected with the workers’ masses.
In this context, Pravda’s successes in the first year were very great.
To avoid tiring our readers with a lot of figures, we shall not give the monthly but the quarterly (that is, three-month) figures for workers’ group collections for Pravda.

108 396 81 35 309 93— — — 5 129 43 1,022177 And so we find that in its first year, Pravda met with support from more than 1,000 groups of workers and laid the foundation for the workers’ paper of Russia’s main industrial area, namely, the Moscow Central Area.
It goes without saying that financial support for Pravda from a thousand workers’ groups implies all kinds of support from a much greater number of workers’ groups; it means that tens of thousands of workers have rallied and united round Pravda.
There is no doubt at all that the number of groups making cash contributions is only a small fraction of the groups of Pravda readers and friends, who helped it by their letters and reports, who helped to circulate the paper, to introduce it among new workers, new sections of the working people, etc.
The working class has advanced a whole vanguard of “front-rankers” who have given a start in the capital to their own, Marxist workers’ newspaper which is hostile to liberal vacillation, and have inaugurated a second workers’ newspaper in the heart of industrial Russia.
What the advanced, class-conscious workers have done for Pravda and for the Moscow workers’ newspaper enables us to pass unerring judgement on the sum total of the great work done by the workers for the enlightenment and the organisation of their class.
For, after all, Pravda and the Moscow newspa-per are only a part, even if an important one, of this great cause.
Encouraged by the success of the first year of the workers’ newspaper, the advanced workers will join forces in untiring,persistent effort to continue the great cause of enlightening and rallying ever broader masses of the proletariat round the ideas of Marxism! Pravda No.
9 2 April 2 3 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Pravda text THE STRUGGLE OF PARTIES IN CHINA The Chinese people have succeeded in overthrowing the old medieval system and the government supporting it.
A republic has been established in China, and the first parlia-ment of that great Asian country, which had long gladdened the hearts of the reactionaries of all nationalities by its immobility and stagnation — the first Chinese Parliament has been elected, convened and has been sitting for several weeks.
In the Lower of the two chambers of the Chinese Parlia-ment, a small majority belongs to the supporters of Sun Yat-sen, the Kuomintang Party, the “Nationalists” — to express this party’s essence in the context of Russian condi-tions, it should be called a radical-Narodnik republican party, a party of democracy.
In the Upper Chamber it has a more considerable majority.
This party is opposed by smaller moderate or conservative parties with all sorts of names like “Radicals”, and so on.
Actually, all these parties are parties of reactionaries, name-ly, bureaucrats, landowners and reactionary bourgeoisie.
They all gravitate to the Chinese Cadet Yüan Shih-k’ai, the provisional President of the Republic, who has been acting more and more like a dictator.
As a Cadet he has been running true to form: yesterday he was a monarchist; now that revolutionary democracy has won out, he is a republi-can; tomorrow he intends to be the head of state, again a monarchist state, that is, to betray the Republic.
Sun Yat-sen’s party is based on the south of China, which is the most advanced, the most developed industrially and commercially, and where the influence of Europe has been greatest.
Yüan Shih-k’ai’s parties are based on the backward north of China.
The early clashes have so far ended in a victory for Yüan Shih-k’ai: he has united all the “moderate” (i.
e.
, reactionary) parties, split off a section of the “Nationalists”, got his man to fill the post of President of the Lower Chamber of Parliament, and contrary to the will of Parliament, secured a loan from “Europe”, i.
e.
, Europe’s swindling billionaires.
The terms of the loan are hard, downright usurious, with the salt gabelle as security.
The loan will put China in pawn to the most reactionary and plunderous European bourgeoi-sie, which is prepared to stamp out the freedom of any nation once profits are involved.
The European capitalists will reap tremendous profits on this loan of almost 250 million rubles.
This turns out to be an alliance between reactionary fear of the European proletariat on the part of the European bourgeoisie and the reactionary classes and sections of China.
For Sun Yat-sen’s party the struggle against this alliance is a very hard one.
What is this party’s weakness? It lies in the fact that it has not yet been able sufficiently to involve broad masses of the Chinese people in the revolution.
The proletariat in China is still very weak — there is therefore no leading class capable of waging a resolute and conscious struggle to carry the democratic revolution to its end.
The peasantry, lacking a leader in the person of the proletariat, is terribly downtrodden, passive, ignorant and indifferent to politics.
Despite the revolutionary overthrow of the old and thorough-ly corrupt monarchy, despite the victory of the republic, China has no universal suffrage! The elections to Parliament had a qualification: only those who had property valued at about 500 rubles were entitled to vote! This also shows how little of the really broad popular mass has yet been drawn into active support of the Chinese Republic.
But without such massive support, without an organised and steadfast leading class, the Republic cannot be stable.
Still, despite its leader Sun Yat-sen’s major shortcomings (pensiveness and indecision, which are due to his lack of proletarian support), revolutionary democracy in China has done a great deal to awaken the people and to win freedom and consistently democratic institutions.
Bydrawing ever broader masses of the Chinese peasantry into the movement and into politics, Sun Yat-sen’s party is becoming (to the extent to which this process is taking place) a great factor of progress in Asia and of mankind’s progress.
Whatever defeats it may suffer from political rogues, adven-turers and dictators, who rely on the country’s reactionary forces, this party’s efforts will not have been in vain.

* The phrase about a struggle waged by “every available means” does not commit anyone to anything.
That is pretty clear.
On the contrary, the phrase seems to have been delib-erately chosen to justify the evasiveness of the liberals.
What are “available” means? Is the leader writer in Luch so childishly naive, is he such a political simpleton that he is not aware that villainous means are “available” to Russian liberalism?? He is aware, but he says nothing, thereby putting a nice make-up on liberalism.
The liberal millionaire, the industrialist Konovalov, who got into the Duma through a gross fraud on democracy (a fine villainous means!), has obtained permission to set up a Russkaya Molva society, with a capital of half a million rubles, with the aim of coupling the Cadets with the Octo-brists in the “Progressist” newspaper Russkaya Molva.
366 That is a fact, and Luch is aware of it.
But together with these Konovalovs and their hack writers Luch signs a reso-lution on a “struggle by every available means”.
I put this to any worker and any thinking peasant: Isn’t it clear that this resolution cheats the people by deliberately using vague words about “availability”, while the Konovalovs are notoriously known to regard as “available” only those means which cannot seriously inconvenience Messrs.
Purishkevich & Co.
? * The beginning of the article has not been discovered.
—Ed.
That much is clear.
All the activity of Messrs.
Konova-lovs — and, of course, not the Konovalovs alone, but all the liberals — has provided ample proof that the only means they regard as available are those which do not undermine the foundations of the welfare and the foundations of the priv-ileges of Messrs.
Purishkevich & Co.
There was need to attend the conference to expose for the thousandth time (we shall never tire of doing this) the fraud and to explain to the naive, or ignorant, or slow-witted democrats the “gist” (or, if you want the straight truth, the dirt and the lie) of the word “availability”.
This is the basest, the most loathsome, the most corrupt word in the Russian political vocabulary.
From the stand-point of grammar it is ridiculous to say: “I recognise only available means”, for who does not know that the unavailable is not available? But the whole point is that the question is not a grammatical, but a political one.
The workers do not regard as available the same things as Konovalov, Milyukov & Co.
do.
Let me take a negative example.
The workers consider unavailable “means” like declaring Rodzyanko’s speech “constitutional” today, and tomorrow railing about the infamy of the Octobrists (who have remained true to themselves and to the Purishkeviches from October 17 or even earlier).
The workers, a fact I am quite sure of, consider that means and that method “unavailable” villainy.
The Kono-vaIovs and the Milyukovs consider it “available” “constitu-tional tactics”.
Let me now take a positive example.
.
.
.
On second thoughts .
.
.
Article 129.
.
.
.
Now, gentlemen, after all you must allow me not to take any positive example in this article, in this newspaper or in this magazine! On the other hand, if I had been at the conference, and if the Konovalovs and the Milyukovs at the conference had promised not to inform on me, I would have cited a positive historical and statistical example that would be fine, excellent, vivid and most convincing!.
.
.
Upon my word, it is a temptation to describe what is considered available in the sphere of action in general and in the sphere of the purse, in particular, by the workers on the one hand, and by the Konovalovs and the Milyukovs on the other.
.
.
.
But I shall refrain.
.
.
.
One should have attended the conference.
It could have offered more freedom of speech than “certain other places”.
There the democrats should have been invited to speak out on the harm of reformism — this would have been opportune from the standpoint of the question that has been raised.
There would have been two resolutions: the democratic and the liberal, one “unavailable” to the liberals (but available to the workers and the class-conscious petty bourgeois, or at least to a section of them) and the other “available” to the Konovalovs.
The public would have read both resolutions or would have heard about both of them and would have given them thought.
It would have thoroughly scrutinised them.
It would have used its brains.
People would have started to make comparisons.
And surely within a short while, the democracy which believes liberal villainy “unavailable” and regards something quite different as available would have started to split away from the section of democracy which is captivated by liberal catchwords and empty phrases.
That, too, would have been “joint action” — but not in the spirit of common talk with the liberals concerning the limits of what is “available” to liberalism.
Yes, indeed, the newspaper Luch is being run by loathsome liberals, but if it carries a few more useful leaders like the one in No.
189, the workers will finally find out these “evil pastors”.
Carry on, gentlemen, and Godspeed! Written not earlier than May 1 0 (2 3 ), 1 9 1 3 Signed: P o s t o r o n n y First published in 1 9 6 1 in Vol.
2 3 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original LANDOWNERS ON THE MIGRATION OF AGRICULTURAL LABOUR Novoye Vremya, a newspaper of the Black-Hundred landowners, reports some interesting discussions among landowners in Poland and in the frontier areas of Russia in general over the migration of agricultural workers to Germa-ny and other European countries in search of employment.
This migration has been rapidly growing.
In 1901, some 218,000 persons a year were estimated to have migrated.
In 1911, the figure was set at 740,000, more than three times the 1901 figure.
In 1912, as many as 800,000 must have left.
Let us note that apart from Polish peasants and workers, Russian workers from the centre of Russia have been also leaving for Germany.
“Now one very often meets men from Tula, Orel and Ryazan on the border and beyond.
” The issue of free ten-month foreign passports for workers going to do agricultural work has intensified this movement.
What is the cause? It is that the Russian peasants are being increasingly ruined and it is ever harder to earn a living in Russia, because of the general stagnation of economic life, which is depressed by the serf-owners and lawlessness.
Wages in Russia are being kept down at the low serf level.
In Russia, the annual agricultural wage averages 62 rubles; add to this 46 rubles’ worth of food a year and you get wages totalling 108 rubles a year.
In Germany, however, wages average 180 rubles a year, i.
e.
, just under twice as much!! (In Britain, let us note in parenthesis, agricultural labourer’s wages come to 300 rubles a year, and in America, to 500 rubles.
) It is natural, therefore, that hundreds of thousands of workers are fleeing from lawless, starving and impoverished Russia to find employment in Germany, and even beyond it — in Denmark, Switzerland and France.
There the workers find out about a higher level of culture, much better culti-vation of the soil, incomparably higher crop yields and, what is most important, political freedom, freedom for the labour press and labour organisations.
And so, we find the landowning gentlemen debating between themselves: some say that the landowner will benefit from this massive training of our workers in better methods of agriculture.
Others wax indignant over the fact that the migration of workers tends to raise wages in the places which they leave.
In Russia, generally speaking — and in Russian legislation in particular — the opinion of the latter prevails, and they would like to see the peasants “settled” (i.
e.
, tied to the land), submissive (without any prospect of moving), down-trodden and barbaric (to prevent them from seeing how to improve their living conditions and how much better off workers in other countries are).
Fortunately, these landowning serf-masters, however hard they may try to break and distort Russian life, no longer have the power to stem the tide of world-wide capitalism, which is uprooting the Russian muzhik as well from his godforsaken hole.

* Mr.
Potresov quotes (rather distorts) G.
V.
Plekha-nov’s article which appeared in August of 1905.
At the time, there was a complete and formal split between the Bolsheviks, who united at the Third Congress of the Social-Democratic Party (London, May 1905), and the Mensheviks, (a “conference” at Geneva at the same time).
367 The Bolshe-viks and the Mensheviks had their own separate press organs both in 1905 and in the spring of 1906.
These are all generally known historical facts, and the rider, Mr.
Potresov, speculates on their being forgotten.
He has to keep silent about them because they expose the rider’s impudence! Neither of the then existing two Social-Democratic parties (and at the time Plekhanov was out of touch with both of them) had any party decision concerning the non-Party significance of (G.
V.
Plekhanov’s article, or its liquida-tionism, its destruction or denial of the Party! That tells the whole story, Mr.
Dodging and Hiding Liberal Rider.
Liquidationism is a trend condemned by formal Party decisions in December 1908 and again in January 1910 (unanimously by all trends).
* The first page of the MS.
has not been found.
—Ed.
No conference (or any other institution) of the Party ever “read” any liquidationism into Plekhanov’s article.
That tells the whole story.
Mr.
A.
N.
Potresov clutches at an old article and presents a sheaf of quotations in order to hush up the fact that the whole Party condemned him, Potre-sov, his liquidationist trend.
Riders from among the liberal intelligentsia, like Mr.
Potresov, are full of a grand, aristocratic contempt for working-class party decisions.
These riders ignore party decisions! And the working-class party ignores the liberal Luch and the liberal Mr.
Potresov, who “reads” liquidationism into Plekhanov’s old articles, as Mr.
V.
Chernov used to “read” Narodism into Liebknecht.
Mr.
Potresov is pathetic and ridiculous in his vain efforts to talk his way out of the fact that liquidationism has been condemned by the Party.
It is only idle talk on the part of Mr.
Potresov and Luch about taking Plekhanov to court, it is only an effort to fool the reader.
They are well aware that everyone will b l a m e them and will laugh at their vain efforts to accuse Plekhanov.

2 3 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original CAPITALISTS AND ARMAMENTS The British labour press is continuing its interesting and instructive campaign of exposure revealing how the syndi-cates of internationally associated capitalists are pushing the nations into war.
Take Nobel’s dynamite trust (or syndicate).
Its capital comes to the tidy sum of 30 million rubles.
Last year, it had a net profit of 3.
3 million rubles.
Eleven per cent in net profit, not bad, eh? In their annual report, the noble dealers in destructive materials modestly explain their success in this short phrase: “This year there was a high demand for military supplies.
”Is it surprising? The capitalist press and the political leaders serving the capitalists have been shouting about war, and clamouring for more armaments — that is so pro-fitable for the industrialists manufacturing military supplies! But who are they, these industrialists? They are the associated capitalists of all nations, the brothers of ministers, members of parliament and so on! Among the shareholders of the “dynamite” trust (which is a shareholder, if not an owner, of four dynamite plants in Germany) we come across the following names: German army: General von Mühlburg, Major Baron von Fritsch, etc.
; British army: General J.
Donald, Colonel Noel Findlay, etc.
; French army: Colonel François Laffargue; Lord Glenconner, brother of Mrs.
Asquith, the British Prime Minister’s wife, Sir North, a minister, Harold Tennant, M.
P.
, Deutsche Bank, Hannover Bank, etc.
The leaders of the national parties in various parliaments who shout about the “might of the state” and about “patrio-tism” (vide the motion formulas of the Cadets, Progres-sists and Octobrists in the Fourth Duma! 368 ) realise this patriotism by arming France against Germany, Germany against Britain, etc.
They are all such ardent patriots.
They are all so concerned, oh, so concerned about the “might of the state” — their own, of course — against the enemy.
And so they sit alongside these “enemies” on the boards and at the meetings of shareholders of the dynamite and other trusts (syndicates), raking in millions of rubles in net profits and pushing — each one his “own” nation — into war against other nations.

1 3 3 , June 1 2 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Pravda text CHEAP MEAT FOR THE “PEOPLE” What a sensation! A most vital need of the workers is being satisfied! Cheap meat for the people — where? what? how? Russkoye Slovo reports that the city slaughter-house in Moscow has opened a “Freibank”, i.
e.
, a shop for the saleof cheap meat which has been rendered harmless and certi-fied as relatively fit for use.
Cheap meat is a good thing.
But what is the meaning of “rendered harmless”, “relatively fit for use” (consequently, there would be equal reason to say “relatively unfit for use”!)? Here is what it means: When animals are put up for sale, they are examined by veterinary inspectors.
Sick ones are rejected.
No permission is given to slaughter them, because their use for food threat-ens to infect humans with various diseases.
Most rejected animals are tubercular and measly (worm-infected).
Of the total of about 450,000 head of cattle going through the Moscow slaughter-house almost 30,000 are rejected as suspect.
And so this suspect measly and tubercular cattle is ren-dered harmless by boiling in a special chamber under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon for about three hours.
This boiling kills off the worms and the tubercular bacilli.
Well, apparently all, or almost all, die off or nearly die off! This yields cheap boiled meat that has been rendered harmless.
The people say, according to a comment in Russkoye Slovo, that “this meat won’t kill you, but it may give you TB or stomach trouble, because, after all, the brutes were ailing.
” The demand for this meat is heavy.
Workers from the city itself go there and queue up for a long time.
The morning queues consist mostly of women, housewives; the day queues, of workers, mainly builders.
The boiled meat that has been rendered harmless and that won’t kill you but will give you stomach trouble is just right for the people.
The people cannot afford real meat.
It is said that the more painstaking the veterinary super-vision, the more meat is rejected.
“So”, Russkoye Slovo concludes, “the population have a twofold interest in thorough supervision: the middle classes want sound meat delivered from the slaughter-house; the poor, more cattle rejected and the Freibank kept well supplied with meat.
” We certainly live in very civilised and philanthropic times: we have learned to make the population take a “twofold interest”.
And the “freedom” for cheap meatis remarkable: after all, “Freibank” in German means “free shop”.
Civilisation, freedom, cheap products, revival of trade — everything is for the people! Whenever you see an advertise-ment: “People’s Quarters Society” — you can be sure that the cellar or garret will be cheap and under medical supervi-sion: it won’t kill you of course, but you will get TB.
Whenever you see a signboard: “People’s Dining-Hall” — don’t hesitate to go in.
You will be served cheap boiled meat which has gone through the slaughter-house under supervision, and which has not gone through the slaughter-house without supervision.
Whenever you see a signboard: “People’s Library” — you can afford to exult.
There you will find cheap or even free pamphlets issued by the Union of the Russian People or the All-Russia Nationalist Club, under the medical super-vision of the spiritual censorship.
It is being said that a “Freibank” is soon to be opened for the sale of “people’s bread” —made of grass, which is boiled, rendered harmless and baked under veterinary, sorry, I mean medical supervision.
Civilisation, freedom, cheap products, revival of trade — everything is for the people! And the population will find itself with a growing twofold interest: the rich, to have their meat sound, and the poor, to have the “Freibank” well stocked with meat relatively fit for use.

1 Printed from the original THE OCTOBRISTS AND THE WORKING -CLASS MOVEMENT The current political situation in Russia is of especial interest.
The negotiations between the Cadets, the Pro-gressists and the Octobrists on common “opposition” tactics in the Duma, on the one hand, and the working-class move-ment, on the other, testify not only to a “revival”, but to something else as well.
One of the highly instructive documents of our interesting period is the appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Union of October Seventeen to party members, urging them (according to Rech) to “discard their apathy and set about working with vigour”.
According to the Octobrist C.
C.
, “now that the revolu-tionary forces are once again coming into motion, evidence of which is incidentally provided by the strikes, all high-minded citizens sincerely desirous of the state’s progressive development should join the Union of October Seventeen, thereby increasing its membership and enhancing its prestige”.
The work of the Octobrists, their C.
C.
believes, should “paralyse the influence of the destructive elements who are again raising their voice in importunate and vociferous calls for another revolution in Russia’s political and social system.
The Central Committee gives a reminder of the sacrifices the state and society will have to suffer, if high-minded men now sit back and shun social activity.
The Central Committee is sure that millions of loyal Russian citizens will not allow a handful of revolutionaries to ruin Russia”.
That is how Rech (No.
275) reports the contents of the interesting appeal from the Octobrist C.
C.
, without apparent-ly finding any departures in it from normal Octobrist policy.
Let us examine the appeal of the Octobrist C.
C.
as a document characterising the history of our time.
The Octobrists are invited to “discard apathy”.
This means that there has been apathy up to now, doesn’t it? When the forces of reaction were triumphant, the Octobrists were apathetic.
When it looked as if the forces of reaction would be adequate to maintain “order” — the Octobrists were satisfied and saw no need to “set about working”.
When the forces of reaction have proved to be inadequate (the forces opposed to the reactionaries “are once again coming into motion”) — then .
.
.
then the Octobrists vigorously set about the business of helping reaction.
Indeed, is it not helping reaction for an influential Duma group to start bashing the “importunate and vociferous” Left-wingers, their desire to “ruin Russia”? Just think: a “handful” only, and they threaten to “ruin Russia”! The Left-wingers, whose newspapers (numbering at least a dozen all over Russia) are being confiscated almost daily, are remarkable, please note, for their “importunity and voci-ferousness”! And that, you will note, is a word-for-word repetition of the truly importunate and vociferous phrases which the reader will find any day in the Black-Hundred government press.
This gives us a picture of what the preaching of “progres-sive” ideas “in the spirit of the October 17 Manifesto” hasactually come to.
As soon as the working-class movement gained in strength and brought about a general revival in social life, our bourgeois “Progressists” at once bared their teeth, not against reaction, but against the working-class movement.
Russia is again facing a balance of forces, similar to the one in evidence eight or nine years ago, but on an extended scale, over a wider field.
At that time, the Octobrists, the Progressists and the Cadets were still undifferentiated and existed together as a united and ostensibly “leading society”.
It would appear that we now have three developed political parties of the bourgeoisie—the Octobrists, the Progressists and the Cadets —who have gone through and tried themselves out in three Dumas and in the eventful years from 1906 to 1912.
There is an ideal division of labour between them: the Octobrists declare outright war on the Lefts and do so in the resolute Black-Hundred spirit; the Progressists were in agreement with the Octobrists yesterday, and today are doing the same thing, promising to pursue this respectable occupation for a long time; the Cadets, for their part, have also long been in “agreement” with the Progressists, friends of the Octobrists, assuring the people of their democratism, you will pardon the expression.
If the working-class movement eight years ago ignored all the Octobrist and the Cadet overt and covert betrayals and vacillations, there is good reason to believe that the workers have not grown more stupid since then.
Za Pravdu No.
1 0 , October 1 5 , 1 9 1 3 Signed: K -p o v Printed from the Za Pravdu text ON THE “JUBILEE OF THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTSIA” The 50th anniversary of Moscow’s liberal newspaper has evoked torrents of laudatory speeches from Russian liberals of every stripe.
That is natural, legitimate and consistent.
Liberals can be expected to celebrate the jubilee of the liberal newspaper.
Russkiye Vedomosti 370 has been no worse than other liberal newspapers, and in some respects (as inthe abundance of scientific material) it has certainly been above the liberal average.
But when the rhetoricians of liberalism, Messrs.
Kova-levsky, Milyukov, Manuilov, Bunin and their like, praise “Russkiye Vedomosti” on behalf of democracy and from an ostensibly democratic standpoint, that is a flagrant lie and it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged.
Distinguished and notable liberals! You all swear that you stand for political freedom.
But you refuse to understand one simple fact, namely, that a liberal society in Russia which allows counter-revolutionary statements by liberals to go unchallenged, does not deserve political freedom and will never get it.
You are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Russkiye Vedomosti, aren’t you? That’s fine.
In that case, do not hide the truth, do not forget that Russkiye Vedomosti was one of the first liberal newspapers to trip up the first serious and deep-going mass movement in Russia, whose aim was to attain political freedom.
That was in the summer of 1905.
The leading light of liberal science and liberal publicism, Mr.
Professor Vinogra-dov the historian, then contributed to Russkiye Vedomosti a remarkable, unforgettable, and memorable “historic” article.
His main idea was as follows: let’s hope our move-ment does not go beyond the German one of 1848-49, otherwise the Prussian watchman will have to restore order over here.
That’s the kind of thing Russkiye Vedomosti, organ of the liberals, printed in the summer of 1905!! Let everyone in Russia who wants to gain a reputation for being a democrat ponder this historical fact.
History has proved — and its proof is irrefutable — that the movement in the autumn of 1905 was weak and inadequate, while a famous liberal found it much too strong in the summer of 1905, and put spokes in its wheels.
The fact is there.
It is incontrovertible.
This liberal and all his fellows, all his — you will pardon me the expression — fellow-politicians among the liberals bear the moral and political blame for the Jewish pogroms in the autumn of 1905.
For, incidentally, the pogromists drew for strength and impudence on precisely this “Vinogradov”-type mood of liberal society.
The “Vinogradov”-type liberals have the government they fully deserve.
The “Vinogradov” liberal writing in Russkiye Vedomosti, and Purishkevich, the collective Purishkevich, are only two sides of the same medal, they are interconnected and interdependent phenomena.
There can be no political freedom in Russia until she has (or because she lacks) mass democracy with a clear understanding of the total short-sightedness, absurdity and vileness of the “Vinogradov”-type liberalism of Russkiye Vedomosti.

We urge workers, in order to safeguard their organisation from ruin, to boycott the slanderers, unless they make a firm and public retraction of their slanders.

5 4 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original RUSSIAN WORKERS’ ASSESSMENT OF THE SPLIT IN THE DUMA SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC GROUP Both Social -Democratic newspapers in St.
Petersburg, which express the views of the liquidators and the pro-Party men, carry statements by workers’ groups from allover Russia.
In these statements, the workers define their attitude to the two Social -Democratic Duma groups: 1) the Social-Democratic group (7 deputies & Jagiello), and 2) the Russian Social -Democratic Labour group — 6 Social -Demo-cratic workers’ deputies.
We are now in a position to sum up the exact results of the workers’ decisions, according to the data in both news-papers, for a whole month, from October 20 to November 20, old style.
The most exact workers’ statements, never once questioned by either side, are the resolutions with a definite number of s i g n a t u r e s .
The overall result, for the whole of Russia (not only the Caucasus, but also the Bund and the Latvians have a special representation on the International Socialist Bureau), is: 4,850 for the Russian Social-Democrat-ic Labour group (6 deputies) and 2,539 for the Social-Demo-cratic group (7 deputies & Jagiello).
Trade unions, as represented by their boards (for police reasons the names of the trade unions in Russia are not published) = 9 unions with 13,500 members, for the 6 deputies; and one union with an unspecified membership, for the 7 deputies.

AND PARTY FUNCTIONARIES (1913) 372 Outline of a Report to Local Organisations December 12 General theme — events of the strike movement and Party life since the summer of 1913.
Conference resolutions.
In particular, the following points are brought out: 1.
A general strike on January 9, 1914.
Conference deci-sion.
Necessity of the strike.
Its slogans (democratic republic.
8-hour working day, confiscation of landed estates).
Inten-sified preparations for the strike.
2.
Insurance campaign.
More extensive circulation of the magazine Voprosy Strakhovaniya.
373— Formation of Party cells inside all societies and all boards.
Getting our own, Party, majority on the boards (also in trade unions, clubs, etc.
, etc.
).
3.
The Six and the Seven.
The main reasons for the split: (a) liquidationism= destruction of the Party.
Struggle over that.
The Seven incline to liquidationism; (b) the Seven do not recognise Party decisions; (c) the majority of the Party has been proved to back the Six.
Main figures from Pravda.
Issues with material on the question of the split should be on hand.
(Resolutions for the Six should be p r e s s e d forward.
) 4.
Party congress.
Necessity of it.
Participation in it of all illegal Party cells.
Its preparation: m o n e y is the main thing.
Collection of fund for congress (mainly through the deputies).
The task for each group or union of groups is by the spring to collect double the amount of expenses (expenses per delegate — 150 rubles.
Each group or union of adjacent groups must collect 300 rubles).
5.
The need to develop ties — to strengthen them (teaching correspondence with the St.
Petersburg Bureau and the Bureau Abroad).
The correspondence is weak: that is why transport is poor.
There must be agents everywhere.
6.
A review of the main points from the resolutions of the conference.
For instance, on the national question: (a) strug-gle against every brand of nationalism, even the refined one (cultural-national autonomy); (b) unity of workers of all nationalities; (c) struggle against Great-Russian Black-Hundred nationalism.
(Idem briefly about the other reso-lutions.
) 7.
Legal and illegal press.
Increase collections.
The legal press will inevitably go down: concentrate efforts on creating an illegal one (see “Announcement”, pp.
9-10 especially).

Krupskaya’s handON THE QUESTION OF THE BUREAU’S NEXT STEPS A number of groups abroad, big, small and tiny, are making a lot of noise over the forthcoming sitting of the International Socialist Bureau on December 1 (14).
374 By the time Tuesday’s edition is out there will perhaps be some news, by cable, of the Bureau’s decision.
I believe it to be my duty, therefore, to describe the state of affairs so as to pre-vent any false rumours and to make it possible to adopt the right tone at once.
The small and tiny groups abroad, who have no support in Russia (like Rosa Luxemburg and the Tyszka people, or Charles Rappoport, who recently wrote in a small French paper in the same spirit, or Alexinsky and the Vperyod group in Paris, etc.
, etc.
), all these little groups are strain-ing hard to have the Bureau take a vote for “unity”.
Of course, we too want unity!! The efforts of the little groups are a pathetic move to protect the liquidators.
This move of theirs will fail: they will make a fuss and that’s as far as it will go.
What decision will the Bureau take? That is, of course, something we don’t know.
But we were told by a very prom-inent member (or even a group of members) that f o r f o r m a l r e a s o n s the idea is to admit the liquida-tor O.
C.
, i n s t e a d o f Plekhanov, and from the Duma group, o n l y the Seven, or rather the Eight.
These formal reasons are as follows: the parliamentary groups in every country do not represent the parties, but only themselves, let us say there are eight Socialist-Revolutionaries and seven Social-Democrats — then only the eight S.
R.
s.
are sent in.
Since that is so (that will be verified), nothing can, of course, be done f o r t h e t i m e b e i n g .
Let the liquidators throw out Plekhanov — we shall see whether this is going to do them any good!!! I am sure that it will not.
That is why I strongly suggest that there should be no nervousness or excitement, either over the rumours being spread by the liquidators, or over any possible Bureau decisions.
We have taken steps to have the reports on Russian affairs from London written through us (about non-Russian affairs directly to you) — c a l m l y wait for them and youwill find that there was no need for any trip and that neither the barking nor the Bureau will rescue the “drowning men” (the liquidators).
There is private information that Plekhanov is not going.
This should not be printed just yet.
I repeat: calmly wait for reports from your own correspondent.
Written not later than December 1 (1 4 ), 1 9 1 3 First published in 1 9 6 1 in Vol.
2 4 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works Printed from the original THE POVERTY OF THE PEOPLE’S TEACHERS 375 In view of the All-Russia Congress on Public Education to be held in December, it is appropriate that we should turn our attention to an old question which is perpetually new: the poverty of the people’s teachers.
We have before us Volume I of the One-Day Census of Primary Schools in the Empire.
The volume has been pub-lished by the Ministry of Public — what you might call — Education.
It is signed by the well-known statistician Mr.
V.
I.
Pokrovsky.
The bureaucratic character of this official work — bureau-cratic and official in the worst sense of the words — instantly leaps to the eye.
The census was taken on January 18, 1911.
It took all of two years to publish its first volume dealing only with the gubernias of the St.
Petersburg academic district! The only thing we seem to be able to do in our country without tedious, agonising red tape is to pass laws, like the law against the press.
As is the practice, the census programme was repeatedly discussed throughout 1910 by a host of official cabinets and conferences, each of which did something to spoil it.
As a result, for instance, there is only one head, “Russian Language”, on the question of the pupils’ mother tongue; it is clearly prohibited to make the subdivision into Byelo-russian, Little Russian (Ukrainian) and Great Russian.
As a result, the census of the schools of the Empire does notinclude a number of schools, such as the urban schools set up under the 1872 statute, private first-and second-category schools, etc.
It is prohibited to collect full data.
It is prohibited to know the truth about the language spoken by the pupils at home.
It is prohibited to make a comparison between public and private schools.
The man who compiled these statistics, Mr.
Pokrovsky, much vaunted by the liberals, has done his bit to spoil the census returns.
Thus, material has been separately collected on each teacher relative to the size of salary.
It is, naturally, important to know the truth on such a burning question as the poverty of the people’s teachers.
It is important to know just how many masters and mistresses are receiving the desperately low, the very lowest, the very low and the low salaries in general.
The material on this has been collected.
The information on it is there.
But our liberal statistician “processes” it in such a way as to cover up the unsavoury truth.
Our statistician merely informs us of the average salaries of masters and mistresses by gubernia and the different categories of schools.
The official classifications are scrupu-lously observed.
But anyone who wants to know the truth is not interested in which gubernia and in which category of schools the teachers starve, but how many teachers are starving and living in poverty.
It was quite possible to determine from the returns of the census how many teachers are being paid starvation salaries (say, under 360 rubles, from 360 to 400 rubles, etc.
), and this should unquestionably have been done.
But it has not been done.
It has been buried in the hundreds of thousands of cards at the archives.
What the public has been informed of is only the officially purged and officially embellished averages of salaries by category and gubernia.
.
.
.
Need we say, too, that the liberal statisticians made a point of concealing from the public what percentage of the starving teachers have families.
These “average” figures show that a schoolmistress (in the St.
Petersburg academic district) receives 433 rubles a year, and a schoolmaster, 376.
But most of the teachers are in the countryside.
There “average” salaries are 347 rubles for the schoolmistress, and 367 rubles for the schoolmaster.
(Let usnote that the overall number of schoolmistresses is double that of schoolmasters).
Most of the teachers of the St.
Petersburg district are outside St.
Petersburg Gubernia.
The salaries of school-mistresses are: Olonets Gubernia — 375 rubles; Novgorod Gubernia — 358 rubles; Vologda Gubernia — 320 rubles; Archangel Gubernia — 319 rubles; and Pskov Gubernia — 312 rubles.
Even these figures, which put a gloss on reality, make it clear that the majority of schoolmistresses are paid a starvation salary.
With the present high cost of living the 6-30 rubles a month for schoolmistresses, of whom (on average again) 11.
5 per cent are married and 4.
4 per cent are widows, is undoubtedly a beggarly salary which con-demns teachers to starvation and indigence.
From the “category” data we find that 2,180 schoolmis-tresses worked in parish one-class schools (in the St.
Peters-burg academic district, with a total of 7,693 schoolmistres-ses).
Consequently, we have here a “category” with a highly impressive number of teachers.
What then are they paid? An average of 30 rubles in the towns, and 301 rubles in the villages.
The Russian state spends hundreds of millions of rubles on the maintenance of its civil service, the police, the army, etc.
, while dooming teachers in the people’s schools to starvation.
The bourgeoisie “sympathises” with public educa-tion — with the proviso, however, that the teachers live in worse conditions than the servants in the manor-houses and the houses of the rich.

Za Pravdu No.
5 1 , December 4 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Za Pravdu text RUSSIAN WORKERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL In this issue of our newspaper comrades workers will find a detailed account of the recent sitting of the International Socialist Bureau in London, and also its resolution on the question of unity of the Social-Democratic forces in Russia.
Class-conscious workers throughout Russia must discuss this resolution with the utmost attention.
A class-conscious worker feels and realises himself to be not only a member of the Russian Marxist family — he is aware that he is also a member of the international family of Marxists.
He also has duties to the workers’ International.
He must take account of the opinions and wishes of the latter.
He must not lose touch with the international workers’ army for a single moment.
Russian Marxist workers will welcome the fact that the workers’ International has shown a desire to make a serious study of the principled discussions which have such a prom-inent part to play in our Russian working-class movement.
The accursed conditions of Russian social and political life have led to a state where our comrades know much less about our movement than about the movement in any other country.
This lack of knowledge about the real state of affairs in Russia is such that just recently German Social-Democratic spokesmen proposed the convocation of all circles of Russian Social-Democrats abroad (12 “trends” abroad) to work out a new programme for the Party.
* But, after all, everyone knows that the Russian proletariat worked out such a programme back in 1903.
.
.
.
This period is, fortunately, about to end.
By its great and heroic struggle, the Russian proletariat has made itself a talking point throughout the civilised world.
The working class of Russia has by rights taken up its place in the workers’ International, and it is safe to say that with every passing year its role in the international arena will be ever bigger and more important.
The decision of the International Bureau gives Russian workers their first chance to acquaint our West-European comrades with the basic substance of our discussions.
The Bureau has put the question like this: 1) it has offered its good offices to bring about unity; 2) it believes the actual differences must be brought out; 3) therefore it has author-ised its Executive Committee to contact and arrange an exchange of opinion with all Social-Democrats accepting the Social-Democratic programme and also those whose programme is close to the Social-Democratic.
Russian Marxists find all this quite acceptable.
* See this volume, pp.
274-77.
—Ed.
It is indeed extremely desirable to bring out the differ-ences.
And even not only those between the Marxists and the liquidators, but also those between the Marxists and the Narodniks, and the Zionist Socialists (whom we regard as being not much worse than the Bund and the P.
P.
S.
), etc.
It would be a considerable success if the International Bureau managed to secure clear cut and precise formulations and to establish the actual basis of the political differ-ences.
But to clear up the differences does not at all mean to eliminate them.
The differences stem from the absolutely divergent views of the present epoch in Russia.
They consti-tute two tactics, two systems of policy — the proletarian and the liberal.
Nothing will eliminate this divergence.
But even there it is extremely desirable to have a precise and definite elucidation of the terms for unity put forward by each of the sides.
Marxist workers are faced with this important task: they must have a thorough discussion of the International Bureau’s proposal and give it every possible attention, outlining their own terms of unity.
These terms are clear.
They flow from the whole course of the working-class movement.
The liquidators must in fact recognise the Marxist whole, they must recognise that the main slogans for agitation among the masses are the three old and basic demands; they must withdraw their amendments to the programme (cultural-national auton-omy); they must refrain from shouting about the “strike itch”; condemn the Bundists’ separatist strivings and demand local mergers; condemn the malicious personal attacks which poison the ideological struggle, etc.
In the sphere of Duma activity, the Seven must unconditionally recognise their subordination to the Marxist whole and retract their anti-Party decisions (Jagiello, abolition of the programme, etc.
).
Even Comrade Plekhanov, who disagrees with us on many points, says in his letter to the Internation-al Bureau that “our Duma group is divided in consequence of certain regrettable decisions adopted by our comrades liquidators, who find themselves in a majority of seven to six”.
It has not yet been cleared up whom it would be useful for the International Bureau to contact for arranging the general exchange of opinion.
It is clear that there are two possible ways: either invitations should go out to represent-atives of the two principal trends: Marxists and liquidators, or to “all Social-Democrats”, and all who regard themselves as being close to the Social-Democrats, in which case it would mean the party of deputy Jagiello (P.
P.
S.
) and various Jewish socialist groups, and those of the Narodniks who consider their stand close to the Social-Democratic programme.
Every class-conscious worker should take an interest in the question raised by the International Bureau.
We urge all workers to raise this question at their meetings, circles, talks, rallies, etc.
, to discuss it, to adopt their resolutions and to publish their opinion in our newspaper.
It is wrong to think that this business is remote and has nothing to do with us.
If the question is raised at the inter-national congress in Vienna 376 (something Marxists would very gladly welcome), the International must know the opinion of the Russian workers, of the proletarian organi-sations operating in Russia, and not only of the isolated circles abroad.
Comrades! Discuss this important question, adopt your decisions and communicate them to your newspaper, P r o l e t a r s k a y a P r a v d a .
The class conscious workers of all countries will listen to what you say.
Proletarskaya Pravda No.
2 , December 8 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Proletarskaya Pravda text HOW THE LIQUIDATORS ARE CHEATING THE WORKERS The International Socialist Bureau has decided to take steps to clarify the differences between Russian socialists and to offer its good offices to unite their forces.
What have the liquidators made of this decision? They have right away made use of it to cheat the Russian workers.
A solemn editorial article in No.
97 of Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta 377 says: “By rejecting the demand of the ‘Six’ for special representation in the interparliamentary section, the International Bureau not only unequivocally condemned their break-away from the Social-Democratic group, but also gave a proper assessment of one of the main demands, whose rejection the six deputies tried to use as an explanation and justification of their walk-out.
” That is not true from start to finish.
We noted this in No.
1 of our newspaper.
378 The liquidators, caught red-handed, are trying to mislead the workers by continuing their lies.
We repeat that the International Bureau did not reject the demand of the Six.
It did not condemn their “break-away”.
It did not even go into an examination of the dispute between the six and the seven deputies.
This is nothing but a liquidationist trick.
The liquidator gentlemen resorted to the same criminal method last year after the sitting of the International Bureau, when Mr.
Martov attributed to the German Social-Democrat Haase words he had never said against the Bol-sheviks, for which he was subsequently exposed in Haase’s published statement.
Here is how the question of deputy representation stood in the Bureau.
The representative of the Marxists merely said that the delegate of the Seven was elected only by the Seven and that the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group does not recognise him as its delegate.
Comrade Huysmans, Secretary of the International Bureau, gave the following explanation.
There are special rules on the interparliamenta-ry section.
According to the rules, where there are several separate socialist groups in a given parliament, representa-tion is given only to the group which has more deputies; the rules take no account of which party the given parliamenta-ry group belongs to and how many workers there are behind it.
The point to note is that parties have their own special representation .
Under these rules, if there were, say, two groups in the Duma, six Social-Democrats and seven Narodniks, only the Narodniks would be given the vote in the interparliament-ary representation.
Here is another example: Bulgaria.
There, 19 Shiroki Socialists (opportunists) and 18 Marxists were elected to Parliament.
The two constitute separate parties and have two separate groups in Parliament.
Both parties also have separate representatives on the Bureau.
But according to the rules, the parliamentary representation can go only to the Shiroki group of 19.
That does not mean, in any sense, that the Bureau “condemned” the 18 Marxist deputies.
That was the formal side of the matter.
Any view can be taken of the rules.
But just now that’s what they are.
In these conditions, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group could not even present its demand.
What should the Seven have done if they wished to be honest? They should have waived the formalities themselves.
It has now been proved and recognised by everyone that several times more organised Social-Democratic workers are backing the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group than the Seven.
The implication is clear.
Those who wish to reckon with the voice of the workers, those who talk so much about unity, should in that case have done more than take the strictly formal approach.
However, the Seven capitalised on their “luck” under the rules.
They have once again issued a challenge to the Russian workers.
What is more, the liquidator gentlemen also began to tell lies about the International allegedly “condemning” the Six, etc.
That was the first response on the part of the liquidator gentlemen to the resolution of the International Socialist Bureau.
Marxist workers will respond to this liquidator fraud by publicly branding these gentlemen.
Comrades, you must continue your serious and thorough discussion of the Bureau’s decision, voice your opinion and give the liquidators the response they deserve for their attempts to cheat the Russian workers.
Proletarskaya Pravda No.
3 , December 1 0 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Proletarskaya Pravda textRESOLUTION ON THE SOCIALIST BUREAU’S DECISION We warmly welcome the decision of the workers’ Interna-tional concerning the need for full and final clarification of the substantial and basic differences existing in Russia between the political trends participating in the working-class movement.
In response to the International’s proposal we believe it necessary, for our part, to outline the basic differences which, in our opinion, divide the Marxists and the liquida-tors into two irreconcilable camps.
We declare, first of all, that for any class-conscious worker it is not a matter of setting up some new entity, but merely of strengthening and fully restoring the old organisation as it took shape more than 15 years ago — with its old pro-gramme and its most important tactical decisions.
The liquidators have split away from this Marxist organisation.
These are the necessary conditions for restoring unity with them in the sphere of work outside the Duma: 1) Full and unconditional recognition (in fact) of “the underground”, unconditional subordination to the decisions of its cells and an undertaking not to allow, in any circum-stances, any kind of attacks against it in the press.
2) Full and unconditional recognition of the fact that the main task of the epoch consists of the three principal demands put forward by the working class of Russia, per-formance of work in that spirit, and repudiation of the liberal-reformist preachings calling for abdication of the old tasks.
3) Retraction of all attempts to change the programme of the Marxists (cultural-national autonomy) and uncondi-tional acceptance of the programme worked out in 1903.
4) Full subordination on questions connected with the strike movement to the decisions of workers organised on Marxist lines, and repudiation of the struggle against the so-called “strike itch ” .
5) Recognition in fact of the proletariat’s independent tactics, and refusal to play down the tasks of the working class for the sake of blocs with the liberals.
6) Recognition that in the matter of work in the trade unions guidance should be taken from the decisions of the International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart and the London Congress of Russian Marxists.
7) Repudiation of the principle of establishing workers’ organisations on the national basis.
Establishment of united organisations in Poland and the North-Western Territory.
Fulfilment by the Bund of the decision on local mergers which has been repeatedly reiterated by Russian Marxists as a whole.
These are the terms for unity in the sphere of Duma activity: I.
Recognition that the group is an organ unconditionally subordinated to the organised will of the Marxist whole.

Condemnation of the splitting acts of the Seven, which have also been condemned by G.

Plekhanov in his letter to the International Socialist Bureau.
As for the groups which it would be useful for the inter-national Bureau to contact for arranging a general exchange of opinion, we demand, above all, that participation in it should be confined exclusively to representatives of workers’ organisations existing in Russia, and should in no instance include any of the circles abroad which are not connected with work in Russia.
We furthermore believe that: 1) either invitations should go out only to the representatives of the two principal trends struggling in Russia, i.
e.
, the Marxists and the liquidators, 2) or, if there is a desire to clarify all differences in general between the Russian Social-Democrats and those who regard themselves as Social-Democrats, invitations should go out without exception, to all workers’ organisations operating in Russia and regarding themselves as being close to the Social-Democrats.
In that case, there is no reason to exclude some of the Left-wing Narodniks, or the Jewish groups who regard themselves as socialists and who compete with the Bund, etc.
Finally, we feel sure that in order to throw a true light on the differences among Russian Social-Democrats, the foreign socialist press will make its pages available to res-ponsible representatives of Russian organisations who — in contrast to émigré circles and irresponsible persons — could give the foreign comrades a precise idea of the ideolog-ical and political basis of the differences in the Russian working-class movement.

9 , December 1 7 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Proletarskaya Pravda text ABOUT OUR SCHOOLS The all-Russia school census of January 18, 1911, makes it possible — despite the extremely bad processing of the data —slightly to lift the veil of official secrecy.
The only data available so far are those on the St.
Peters-burg academic district, separately for the towns and villages.
Let us see on the basis of these data what our parish schools are like.
In the towns, there were 329 city one-class schools, 139 private third-category and 177 parish one-class schools.
Let us compare the schoolmistresses’ average salaries (the number of schoolmasters is quite small): city schools — 924 rubles a year, private —609, parish —30.
Poor, starving schoolmistresses — that is what our parish schools are.
Let us see what the percentage of teachers with higher and secondary lay general education is.
In the city schools — 76 per cent, private — 67 per cent, and parish — 18 per cent! Uneducated schoolmistresses (we say nothing as yet about the teachers of catechism) — that is what our parish schools are.
In the villages we have 3,545 Zemstvo one-class schools and 2,506 parish one-class schools.
In the former, the average salary of schoolmistresses is 374 rubles a year, in the latter —301 rubles.
In the former, educated teachers (teachers in general) come to 20 per cent, in the latter — 2.
5 per cent — once again without the teachers of catechism.
These data give an idea of the plight of the parish schools!The census has also collected data on the average number of square arshins* of floor-space and cubic arshins of air-space per pupil —i.
e.
, the crowding of schools.
The Zemstvo schools have 2.
6 sq.
arshins of floor-space and 10.
1 cu.
arshins of air; the parish schools, 2.
4 sq.
arshins and 9.
6 cu.
arshins, respectively.
The floor-space should be six times the light area of the windows.
Actually, it is nine times greater, i.
e.
, the schools are not only crowded, but also dark.
These data are, of course, extremely meagre.
The Ministry tried very hard to prevent the collection of detailed, precise and full data on the beggarly condition of our schools.
Even so, the beggarly condition of the parish schools stands out in these incomplete, officially curtailed and poor-ly processed data.
One of the vital tasks before the representatives of workers’ cultural and educational and trade union organisations at the forthcoming All-Russia Congress on Public Education is to make a comprehensive presentation of the question and to shed every possible light on the condition of our schools and schoolteachers.
Proletarskaya Pravda No.
1 0 , December 1 8 , 1 9 1 3 Printed from the Proletarskaya Pravda text THE DUMA GROUP AND THE MAJORITY OUTSIDE Lomtatidze’s letter on the struggle between the Six and the Seven in the Duma group was curiously run in the liquidators’ newspaper alongside the calculation that 3,701 persons came out in favour of the liquidators (No.
75, p.
2).
We leave the verification of this figure for another article, merely noting that three days earlier Za Pravdu (No.
26) reported the figure of 5,000, which has not been refuted by our opponents.
The Seven have been clearly shown again and again to represent a minority of the workers.
* Arshin= 28 inches.
—Ed.
That is why Lomtatidze’s “tough words” make an especi-ally awkward impression.
It is a sign of extreme weakness and impotent irritation to call names, to give a reminder of various episodes of the old and most embittered struggle, and to shout: “This is impudent, absurd, cynical”, etc.
, etc.
It remains an unrefuted and incontrovertible fact that 1) the majority of class-conscious workers are backing the Six; and that 2) the Seven refuse to recognise the will and the decisions of the majority, and also refuse to recognise the governing institution accepted by the majority.
One feels a sense of embarrassment and shame for the irritated Lomtatidze, when he says: “Have they (the Six) indicated a single instance in which the political actions in the Duma have run counter to the interests of our cause, our slogans and our traditions?” Lomtatidze’s lofty tone makes a false impression, once we are aware that not only the Six, but the highest govern-ing institution, which they recognise, have long since indicated officially and in formal terms the violation of the programme by the Seven, to cite an instance! With his clumsy irritation and his irrelevant questions, Lomtatidze merely underscores the really profound essence of the entire conflict — the fight of non-party men against the Party principle.
That is the essence.
Nor is it a joke or a trifle but the most serious and painful question.
Not everyone who says: “Lord! Lord!” will enter the kingdom of heaven! Not everyone who beats his breast and shouts “unity, unity” is actually working for unity.
What is working-class unity? It is above all and chiefly unity of its political organisa-tion, of its entity.
That is the only kind of unity that can ensure real unity of the Duma group and of all the action and struggle of the working class in general.
That is the unity the liquidationist trend has violated, as the Party’s official resolutions have repeatedly recognised since 1908.
That is the crux of the matter.
In evading it, Lomtatidze merely reveals his error.
The Seven are entirely to blame for the split, because they have violated the programme, they have come out in defence of the liquidators, who were destroying the Party, they have ignored the formal decisions of the majority, and they have been violating the will of the organised workers.
There is no other way out for them but to recognise their fault, accept the Six as representatives of the majority and start systematically moving closer to them through an agreement.

An effort is made to get the people into the schools.
Every-thing is done to set up libraries.
Over here, the Ministry of Public, what you might call, “Education” resorts to the most desperate efforts, to the most ignominious police measures to hamper the cause of education and to prevent the people from acquiring knowledge! Over here, the Ministry has destroyed school libraries!! No civilised country in the world still has any special rules against libraries, or such a foul institution as the censorship.
But over here, apart from the persecution of the press in general, apart from the wild measures against libraries in general, rules which are a hundred times more restrictive are being issued against * From here on the entry is in pencil on the back cover of the notebook.

the public libraries! This is an outrageous policy of benighting the people, an outrageous policy of the landown-ers, who want the country to become barbaric.
Some rich men, like Pavlenkov, have donated money for public libra-ries.
Now, the wild landowners’ government has destroyed the libraries.
Isn’t it about time for those who want to help education in Russia to understand that the money should be donated not for the libraries which are under the Ministry and are due to be destroyed, but for the struggle for political freedom, without which Russia is suffocating in barbarism.

activity over the last two years shows up the existence of liquidationism, which has hampered the re-establishment of the Party.
Unless we make a study of the political causes of the Party split, we shall be unable to understand the present disarray.
Erroneous trends were already pointed out at the 1908 Conference and later at the 1910 Plenary Meeting.
On the one hand, there is otzovism, which has failed to understand the new conditions in Russia, and on the other, liquidationism, which either rejects theParty or minimises the importance of the illegal Party.
These trends arose under the influence of the bourgeoisie.
Liquidationism is a broad phenomenon.
As early as 1906, there appeared men among the Socialist-Revolutionaries (Narodniks) who tried to legalise the Party.
That is a policy of adaptation we see the Cadets pursuing.
The same spirit of time-serving prevails among the Social-Democrat liquida-tors.
A strong party can be set up only in the struggle against this liquidationism.
That was already clearly stated by the 1908 Conference.
After the Plenary Meeting the Party split up.
The Central Committee Bureau Abroad, failing to call a Plenary Meeting, was itself subsequently wound up.
The Party had to be re-established in struggle against the liquida-tors, and that was done by the January Conference.
It adopted a decision to the effect that the liquidators had to be fought in the workers’ curia, but Comrade Braun called the decision Asiatic.
However, such a decision is merely a more consistent conclusion from the resolution adopted by the Plenary Meeting.
The January Conference was censured on every hand.
But what was the actual situation over this January Conference? If it had in fact been nothing but a conference of splitters, the whole Party should have rallied to prove that the Conference did not represent the Party.
But that did not happen.
Comrade Braun said: the broad masses are not following Lenin.
But serious-minded persons do not decide matters in that way; the facts must be examined to their full extent.
And what do the facts indicate? The data on the results of the elections in the workers’ curia were published: at the elections to the Second Duma the Bolsheviks received 47 per cent of the votes, at the elec-tions to the Third Duma, 50 per cent, and at the elections to the Fourth Duma, 67 per cent.
These facts are incontro-vertible, and prove that the decisions of the January Con-ference were correct.
What the Conference decided was real-ised at the elections.
The majority of class-conscious workers in Russia are following the Bolsheviks, and this proves that the struggle against the liquidators was necessary.
Even the legal press now admits that the majority of the class-conscious workers are backing the Bolsheviks.
According to Comrade Braun, the August conference 386 adopted the demands he put forward: the democratic repub-lic slogan and the need for an illegal party.
Why, in that case, does Comrade Braun want to leave the Organising Committee set up by the conference? That is not evidence of political wisdom or steadfastness in political activity.
Comrade Braun said that there were now only a few odd liquidators among the writers but that liquidationism as such no longer existed.
But what then is the meaning of Luch attacking the illegal Party and fighting against the pro-Party men? The liquidators have failed to keep their promises to Comrade Braun: they did not support the democratic republic slogan and the need for an illegal party.
The Latvians want to withdraw from the Organising Committee.
That, too, shows that the August bloc was nothing but a fiction.
It is ridiculous or even demagogic to talk of unity with the liquidators, until they abandon their present views and adopt views that are diametrically (completely) opposed to their present ones.
There can be no unity so long as liquidationism remains what it is.
Those who stand for a legal party will not unite with those who stand for an illegal one.
There are now two parties, one real, the other fictitious.
This fictitious party consists of a group of intellectuals whose attacks on the illegal Party merely disorganise the workers.
Luch itself does not unite all the writers of the August bloc, but only the liqui-dators.
The only thing to do about the liquidators is to fight them.
“Demagogy”, “unity”, “splitters”, are only loud words and nothing more; even a parrot can mouth them.
But let us look at the facts.
In the course of a year, Pravda united almost 2,000 workers’ groups, and Luch, only 550.
The organ which stands for the illegal Party mustered four times more supporters than the “all trend” paper.
The facts show that they, the Bolsheviks, united the majority of the Russian workers.
This point was also made by the conference convened in summer.
Lenin is being rebuked for splitting the group.
But, for a whole year, six deputies fought against liquidationism in the group.
The majority is for the Bolsheviks, the Party is behind them.
The group must submit to the Party majori-ty and must act together with the Party.
By failing to do so they place themselves outside the Party, by the side of the Party.
It is everywhere established that the group must submit to the decisions of the party.
We must have the same thing in Russia as well.
The deputies of the Duma are not just Social-Democratic chatterboxes, but Party workers who must submit to the Party.
Everything that is behind the liquidators is fiction, phrase-mongering, name-calling.
What has actually hap-pened since the group split up? The six deputies have got 6,000 signatures, the seven, 2,000.
Anyone can read about this in the press.
Martov said that behind the Seven were Marxist institutions, but these are institutions which do not represent the mass of Party members, but are only a fiction.
The Bolsheviks stand for unity.
But who are those people who are unable to join the illegal Party? The illegal Party must be united.
It must be united from below.
Fighting is the only thing that can be done against those who attack the illegal Party and belittle the importance of such a par-ty.
Let’s have a guarantee that the illegal Party will remain intact, that the democratic republic slogan will not be stained — only then is unity possible at the top and at the bottom.
I do not know about Asia, but in Europe split-ters are those who refuse to recognise the majority.
Split-ters are a minority who refuse to submit to majority decisions.

I am being attacked for “demagogic methods”, for splitting, etc.
But what have our opponents been doing? They have always thrown dirt at the Bolsheviks.
You have an example in Martov’s unseemly pamphlet.
— I merelyexpressed my opinion that the Bolsheviks would attend the conference of the International Bureau.
But the decision is still up to the Central Committee, on which the workers are sitting.
It is they and not Lenin that will decide this ques-tion.
Those who say that there is no liquidationism, show little respect for the Congress.
What liquidationism is has already been clearly stated in Party decisions since 1908.
These decisions have not been revoked and they must be reckoned with.
Liquidationist ideas are now being preached in the newspapers of the “August bloc”.
Supporters of the Organising Committee here insist that they are not opposing the Party, but what has their paper been saying? Such examples are numerous.
The conciliator An wanted to come out against the no-Party agitation, but the Editorial Board refused to change its view.
There can be no union with those who stand up for the views of the newspaper Luch.
It is liquidationism to work for an “open labour party”.
— The conference which is being called should not be attended for the purpose of uniting with the liquidators, but for expos-ing them and proving that the August bloc is a fiction.
— The liquidationist press has been narrowing down the slogans and curbing the revolutionary tactics.
The liquidators have no illegal literature of any sort; only the Bolsheviks have such literature.
The existence of Bolshevik organisations in Russia is evident from the last issue (31).
The elections to the Fourth Duma have also shown that the overwhelm-ing majority of the workers are behind the Bolsheviks.
These are facts which everyone can verify.
This is also evidenced by the financial support to the newspapers.
— Cries about unity are not important in themselves.
The ability to unite must be there.
The Bolsheviks in Russia have united a majority, while the August conference; by contrast, has united nothing.
Braun is pulling away from it, Trotsky is doing the same — the “August bloc” is falling apart.
Buryanov, too, has not remained among the seven deputies.
— To make union possible the liquidators must be condemned.

Ziemelis’s Resolution 1.
There is an overriding need to unite all truly Social-Democratic forces and have strict Party unity in Russia, especially now that the working-class struggle has been steadily expanding.
Such unity is possible only between Social-Democrats who in their activity recognise that: a) at the present time the R.
S.

P.
can exist only illegally and that all Social-Democrats must join the illegal Party organisation; b) Russian Social-Democracy must conduct agitation among the masses in the spirit of the revolutionary demands of 1905, urging the workers to march in the van of the entire emancipation movement and to work for another revolution.
The Congress recognises that every town must have a united Social-Democratic organisation to include workers of all nationalities and to conduct work in all the languages spoken by the local proletariat.
The Congress invites Social-Democrats of all nationalities to work vigorously for real proletarian unity, a unity which is truly solid and which is organised by the workers themselves from below.
2.
For the last five years, the liquidationist trend has been the central question of the internal Party struggle.
As early as the All-Russia Conference of 1908, before any splits had occurred, the Party resolved that it regarded liquidationism as an attempt by a section of the Party intelligentsia to liquidate the existing R.

P.
Central Com-mittee in January 1910, at which all directions and trends in the Party were represented, liquidationism was onceagain unanimously condemned by the whole Party as a “manifestation of bourgeois influence on the proletariat”, which was expressed in the rejection of the illegal Social-Democratic Party, the belittling of its role and importance, the attempts to curtail the programme and tactical tasks and slogans of revolutionary Social-Democracy, and so on.
The attempt on the part of the conciliators to unite with the liquidators at any price (the August 1912 confer-ence) proved to be useless, and the uniters found themselves ideologically and politically dependent on the liqui-dators.
The Fourth Social-Democratic Congress of the Latvian Territory definitely condemns the liquidationist trend and resolves to recall its representative from the Organising Committee, which has failed to dissociate itself from the liquidators.

In order to conduct broad political campaigns, the Congress authorises the Central Committee to contact organisations whose political line coincides with the resolu-tions adopted at the Congress.

The Congress welcomes the initiative of the Interna-tional Socialist Bureau in raising the question of unification in Russian Social-Democracy, and authorises the Central Committee to promote this through all relevant steps, while standing up for the views expressed in this resolu-tion.

Kozminykh-Lanin.
O v e r t i m e a t F a c t o r i e s and Plants in Moscow Gubernia.
Moscow , 1914.
Price 1.
00 rubl e.
The recently published new statistical pamphlet by Mr.
Kozminykh-Lanin examines the question of overtime, which is of exceptional importance for the Russian workers.
Let us note that the statistical data given by Kozminykh-Lanin relate to the year of 1908 only and apply exclusively to workers of Moscow Gubernia.
Moreover, the 1908 figures must now be largely out of date, especially in view of the fact that 1908 was a year of industrial stagnation, and that it was followed by a year of industrial upswing, and a parallel and intensified demand for manpower.
This,for its part, was bound to lead to greater use of overtime in a number of industries.
The data given by Kozminykh-Lanin (a factory inspector in Moscow Gubernia) are undoubtedly of a semi-official character, they were collected through an inquiry among the employers, so that they should be taken with a grain of salt but must none the less be given the most serious attention.
For one thing, the literature on the question is so scarce in Russia that every work must be made use of, quite apart from the fact that even these semi-official statistics yield a great deal that is highly interesting.
Mr.
Kozminykh-Lanin carried out his inquiry among a total of 112,380 workers in 152 enterprises of Moscow Gubernia, mainly large-scale ones, with the textile in-dustry being prevalent in the inquiry.
The figures given in the pamphlet indicate that overtime is not widely practised in the textile industry of the Moscow area.
Thus, of the 59,000 workers engaged in the processing of cotton, covered by the inquiry, only 767 did overtime on holidays.
Considerably greater numbers did overtime on weekdays (1,717), but even there the figure fluctuates be-tween 1 and 2 per cent of the total.
That is understandable, because technical requirements in the textile industry are such that at every given moment there must be a definite number of hands specified more or less in advance; and the main thing is that 1908 was less than favourable for the textile industry.
Employers were frequently concerned in cutting back production, rather than in increasing the pro-ductivity of their enterprises through overtime.
The metalworking industry, another leading branch, presents a different picture.
There overtime is widely practised, Sometimes involving up to 20 per cent of the total number of workers.
As for the duration of overtime, according to Kozminykh-Lanin’s data, it generally fluctuates both for metalworkers and textile workers between 25 and 35 hours per worker doing overtime (counting work on both weekdays and holidays).
This is a very high figure.
The 30 hours of free time on average taken up by overtime earning naturally add up entirely to so much harm done to the worker’s cultural and mental development.
Let us see what workers are paid for the plunder of their labour-in terms of brains, muscles and nerves.
.
.
.
Mr.
Kozmi-nykh-Lanin gives a very detailed calculation of the per-hour remuneration of workers for overtime in the several branches.
We find that this work earns textile workers an average of only 15-16 kopeks an hour, rarely more than that.
These rates are slightly increased towards April and September, and then decline again to 13 kopeks in December-February.
The earnings are especially small at wool-weaving mills; thus, the average per-hour wage for March came to only 6.
75 kopeks for Sunday and holiday work.
If those are overtime rates, how low the ordinary ones must be! The tables show that the labour of metalworkers is not much better paid than that of textile workers; the average per-hour overtime earnings fluctuate from 13 to 20 kopeks.
In general, the level and change of rates for the overtime work of Moscow metalworkers clearly show that the working conditions there are highly unfavourable even in com-parison with, say, St.
Petersburg.
For all their overtime, Moscow workers are paid next to nothing.
Thus, average monthly earnings for overtime were: Textile workers Sundays and holidays Weekdays .

Kozminykh-Lanin’s inquiry dealt little, if at all, with the main sphere of overtime — small-scale industry (only 1.
45 per cent of the workers covered by the inquiry were engaged in under-takings employing less than 100 persons).
Yet, we feelsure that the examination of working conditions in small-scale industry would have produced some astounding results.

Struve under the chauvinistic-clerical protest against German barbarity.
4 4 0 In a talk we once had about Chaliapin’s genuflections, Gorky said: “You can’t judge him too strictly; we artists have a different mentality.
” In other words, the artist frequently acts under the influence of his emotion, which at-tains such a force that it suppresses all other considerations.
Let that be so.
Let us say that Chaliapin must not be strictly judged.
He is an artist, and nothing more.
He is a stranger to the cause of the proletariat: today, he is a friend of the workers, tomorrow, a reactionary, moved by his emotion.
But the workers have grown accustomed to regard Gorky as their own.
They have always believed that his heart beats as warmly as theirs for the cause of the proletariat, and that he has dedicated his talent to the service of this cause.
That is why they keep sending messages of greetings to Gorky, and that is why his name is so dear to them.
It is this trust on the part of the class-conscious workers that imposes on Gorky a certain duty— to cherish his good name and to refrain from putting his signature to all sorts of cheap chauvinist protests which could well confuse the workers who lack political consciousness.
They are still unable to find their bearings in many situations, and could be led astray by Gorky’s name.
Struve’s name will not confuse any worker, but Gorky’s may.
Therefore, the class-conscious workers, who well realise the falsehood and the vulgarity of this hypocritical protest against the “German barbarians”, must feel that they have to rebuke the author of The Song of the Falcon.
They will-tell him: “At this hard and responsible moment through which the proletariat of Russia is going, we expected you to go hand in hand with its leading fighters and not with Mr.
Struve & Co.

3 4 , December 5 , 1 9 1 4 Printed from the Sotsial-Demokrat EDITORIAL NOTE TO THE ARTICLE “THE UKRAINE AND THE WAR” From the Editors The above article has been written by a prominent sup-porter of the Dzvin trend.
441 Just recently, we have had to engage in some sharp polemics with that trend.
We still have some differences with its writers.
We do not regard as correct the concessions they have made to nationalism; we believe the idea of “cultural-national autonomy” to be bourgeois nationalism; we do not think that the best way to organise the proletariat is to break it up into nation-al curias, and we do not share their views of the distinc-tions between “anational”, national and international.
Being advocates of consistent i n t e r n a t i o n a l i s m , we entertain the hope that the author of this article and his friends will learn the necessary lessons from the events of the European war.
At any rate, we are happy to note that precisely at this hard moment the said group of Ukrainian leaders are most aware of their propinquity with Sotsial-Demokrat.
It is to their credit that they have succeeded in separating them-selves from the notorious “Alliance for the Liberation of the Ukraine”, 442 whose activity has nothing in common with Social-Democracy.

C.
Delegation The current world war, which is the cause of so much distress wherever it has broken out, which has devastated and ruined Belgium and Galicia, and which has ruined the lives of thousands upon thousands of workers — this war is an imperialist one, caused by the struggle between the ruling classes of various countries for a division of the colonies and domination of the world market, and by dynastic interests.
It is a natural continuation of the policy conducted by the class of capitalists and the governments of all count-ries; and that is why the question of who struck out first is altogether irrelevant from the socialist standpoint.
This war, far from serving any interests of the workers, is in fact a weapon in the hands of the ruling classes for disrupting the international solidarity of the workers and weakening their movement and class struggle in each coun-try.
Similarly, the “defend your country” watchword, put forward by the bourgeoisie and supported by the opportun-ists, is nothing but a bait to which the bourgeoisie hopes the proletariat will rise and be induced to give their life and blood for its interests.
In view of all this, the Extraordinary International Socialist Women’s Conference, on the strength of the Stutt-gart resolution, which recommends the use of the economic and political crisis, brought about by the war, for rousing the people to accelerate the collapse of the capitalist system, on the strength of the Copenhagen resolution, which says that it is the duty of deputies to vote against war credits, and of the Basle resolution, which says that the workers consider it a crime to shoot down each other — declares that the representatives of most of the socialist parties of the belligerent countries acted in complete discord with these resolutions and, succumbing to the pressure of circumstances, committed a real betrayal in respect of socialism, sup-planting it with nationalism; it insists that the proletarians of all countries have no enemy other than their class ene-my —the class of capitalists.
The horrible suffering caused by this war awakens in all women, especially proletarian women, a growing desire for peace.
Declaring war on all imperialist war, the confer-ence at the same time believes that if this desire for peace is to be transformed into a conscious political force, working women must well realise that the propertied classes are striving for nothing but annexations, conquest and domination, that in the epoch of imperialism wars are inevitable, and that imperialism threatens the world with a series of wars, unless the proletariat musters enough strength to put an end to the capitalist system by the final overthrow of capitalism.
Every working woman who wants to shorten the period of suffering connected with the epoch of imperialist wars, must strive to have her urge for peace develop into indig-nation and struggle for socialism.
The working woman will attain her aim in this struggle only through a revolutionary mass movement, and a strengthening and sharpening of the socialist struggle.
Consequently, her first duty is to support the trade union and socialist organisations and break the civil peace by fighting against the war credits, against entry into bourgeois ministries, by supporting and spread-ing the idea of soldiers’ fraternisation in the trenches on the field of battle, by setting up illegal organisations wherever the government has abolished the constitutional freedoms, and finally, by drawing the mass into manife-stations and revolutionary movements.
The International Socialist Women’s Conference calls on the working women of all countries to start this struggle right away, organising it on an international scale, and closely tying in their work with that of the socialists of all countries who, like Liebknecht, are fighting against nationalism and waging a revolutionary socialist s t r u g g l e .
At the same time, the conference gives working women a reminder that in the most advanced countries of Europe the objective conditions for socialist production are already there, that the whole movement is entering a new phase, that the current world war imposes fresh and serious duties upon them, and that their movement may be the forerunner of a general mass action which could give fresh scope to the whole socialist movement and advance the hour of final emancipation.
By taking the initiative in staging demon-strations and revolutionary manifestations, working women, marching hand in hand with the proletarians, could usher in a new era of proletarian struggle in the course of which the proletariat will win socialism in the more advanced countries, and a democratic republic in the more backward ones.
Supplement to Sotsial-Democrat No.
4 2 , June 1 , 1 9 1 5 Printed from the text of the SupplementTHE FIRST INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST C O N F E R E N C E A T Z I M M E R W A L D 445 A U G U S T ù 3 -ù 6 (S E P T E M B E R 5 -8 ) , 1915 1 VARIANT OF THE DRAFT RESOLUTION O F L E F T-W I N G S O C I A L -D E M O C R A T S FOR THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL SOCIALIST CONFERENCE Draft The present war springs from imperialism, i.
e.
, the high-est stage of capitalism, when the development of the pro-ductive forces and the growth of capital have gone beyond the narrow framework of separate national states, and induce the “great” powers to try to enslave other nations and seize colonies as sources of raw materials and areas for the export of capital.
The objective conditions are quite ripe for socialism and the great powers are fighting the current war in an effort artificially to delay the collapse of capitalism, by preserving and intensifying the dependence of colonies, by seizing privileges on the world market, and by splitting and sup-pressing the international revolutionary struggle of the workers.
Social-Democrats fully recognise the necessity of freedom for all nations.
In the epoch of struggle against feudalism, absolutism and foreign national oppression, they recognised defence of one’s country — today they recognise as just the war waged by the oppressed nations (especially colonies) against their oppressors, the “great” powers.
But the current war between the great powers is a war between slave-owners to intensify and consolidate slavery, for a redivision of the colonies, for the “right” to oppress other nations, for the privileges of great-power capital and for the reactionary suppression of the working-class movement.
That is why talk about “defence of one’s country” on the part of both belligerent groups of powers is a bour-geois swindle of the people.
Neither the victory by any of the present governments, nor the status quo ante bellumcan safeguard the freedom of nations from the imperialist great powers, nor can it give the possibility of a decent life to the working class, which is being increasingly weighed down by the high cost of living, the trusts, militarism and its attendant political reaction, even in the freest countries.
The real meaning of the “defend your country” slogan in this war is defence of the great-power privileges and advan-tages, defence of the “right” of the given bourgeoisie to oppress other nations, it is a national-liberal labour policy, an alliance between a small section of the workers and their “own” national bourgeoisie against the mass of proletarians and the exploited.
Socialists conducting such a policy are in fact chauvinists — social-chauvinists.
The policy of voting for war credits, entering ministries, Burgfrieden, * etc.
, is a policy of opportunism and betrayal of socialism.
The working class cannot attain its great aim of labour emancipation, without carrying on a resolute struggle against opportunism and social-chauvinism.
The Basle Manifesto of 1912, adopted unanimously in anticipation of precisely the kind of war between the great powers which has in fact come about, definitely recognised the reactionary and imperialist character of the war, and clearly announced the approach of a proletarian revolution in connection with such a war.
In effect, the war has created a revolutionary situation, and has generated revolutionary sentiments and discontent.
It is the task of Social-Democrats to maintain and develop these, help to clear the revolution-ary awareness of the masses and purge their minds of the falsehood of bourgeois and socialist chauvinism, promote every effort at revolutionary mass struggle against impe-rialism, for socialism, and to work to transform the impe-rialist war into a civil war for socialism.
To intensify their revolutionary agitation, Social-Demo-crats must make use of the growing massive desire for peace, which expresses the disappointment of the masses and the clearing of their revolutionary consciousness.
But in so doing, Social-Democrats should not deceive the people by holding out hopes for any kind of stable democratic * Peace at home.

peace, that would rule out the oppression of nations, and that would come soon and without the revolutionary over-throw of the present governments.

2 7 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works 1 1 Printed from the original 4 SPEECHES IN THE DEBATE ON THE MANIFESTO AND THE DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE WAR A N D T H E T A S K S O F S O C I A L-D E M O C R A C Y AUGUST 25 (SEPTEMBER 7) 1 It was inevitable that things here should have come to a struggle of opinion between Ledebour and us.
448 However, I must protest against the method used here by Ledebour in attacking Radek.
The assertion that our manifesto has been signed only by men who are safe is inadmissible.
It has also been signed by the Latvian delegates and Borchardt.
Another old and hackneyed argument is saying that one should not call the masses to revolutionary action unless one is able to take a direct part in it oneself.
Further-more, I deny that there should be no mention of the means of struggle.
That has occurred in all revolutionary periods The means should be made known to the masses so that they could be explained and discussed.
We in Russia have always acted in this way; in fact, the interpretation of the means of struggle had been the subject of arguments between Plekhanov and myself even in the pro-revolutionary years.
When the objective historical situation of 1847 confrontedGermany with revolution, Marx and Engels sent out an appeal from London calling for violence.
449 The German movement is faced with a decision.
If we are indeed on the threshold of a revolutionary epoch in which the masses will go over to revolutionary struggle, we must also make men-tion of the means necessary for this struggle.
According to the revisionist view taken by David and others, that is naturally something quite useless: after all, they do not believe that we are on the eve of a revolutionary epoch.
We who believe this must act otherwise.
You cannot make revolution without explaining revolutionary tactics.
It was precisely the worst feature of the Second International that it constantly avoided explanations; and it is that which the Dutch Tribune-Marxists 450 quite correctly called the German Centre is “passive revolutionary attitude”.
Now on the question of persecutions.
You in Germany should in general do more than legal work, if you want real action.
You must combine legal and illegal activity.
The old methods are no longer adequate to the new situation.
You yourselves have said: we are going forward to an epoch of great class battles.
In that case, you must also have the means for this.
And it is not at all necessary for the manifesto to be signed, it could well be issued without signatures.
At any rate, you should not act semi-legally, like Clara Zetkin, for instance.
That calls for too much sacrifice.
Here is how things stand: either a truly revolutionary struggle or mere empty talk which will help no one but the deserters, against whom Liebknecht speaks out so sharply in this letter.
451 Coming out for peace does not mean much in itself.
David also writes: we are not for the war, but only against defeat.
Everyone wants peace.
Taking account of the new situation, we should use new and specific means of struggle which should not be similar in any way to the old German or Russian methods.
2 I do not agree with Serrati that the resolution will appear either too early or too late.
452 After this war, other, mainly colonial, wars will be waged.
Unless the proletariat turns off the social-imperialist way, proletarian solidarity willbe completely destroyed; that is why we must determine common tactics.
If we adopt only a manifesto, Vandervelde, L’Humanité and others will once again start deceiving the masses; they will keep saying that they, too, oppose war and want peace.
The old vagueness will remain.

We vote for, in particular, because two French comrades have put forward an important considera-tion.
It is they who have pointed to the exceptionally oppressed condition of the workers in France, their extreme corruption by revolutionary phrase-mon-gering, and the need for a slow and cautious transi-tion to resolute tactics.
But in Europe as a whole it is opportunism that is the enemy of the working-class movement.

The opportunism which has strangulated the Social-Democratic Party of Germany and has transformed that party into a national-liberal labour party, has crystallised as social-chauvinism in the 1914-15 war.

Thus, only a transition stage of dictatorship by the oppressed class leads to the abolition of classes, only the liberation of the oppressed nations and real eradication of national oppres-sion leads to the fusion of nations, and the political crite-rion of the feasibility of this lies precisely in the freedom to secede.
Freedom to secede is the best and the only polit-ical means against the idiotic system of petty states and national isolation which, to mankind’s good fortune, is being inexorably destroyed by the whole course of capi-talist development.

CENTRAL COMMITTEE TO TERMINATE PUBLICATION OF THE JOURNAL K O M M U N I S T 487 Not for the press: Taking into consideration (1) that Kommunist was founded — temporarily and as an experiment — by a federated editorial board, when there had been no sign of any difference on any substantial ques-tion between the C.

Editorial Board and the rest of the Editorial Board as a whole; (2) that after No.
1-2 of “Kommunist” three members of the Editorial Board put forward such differences in their signed theses on the question of self-determination; (3) that an exchange of opinion on this question revealed deep divergence over the assessment of the role of democrat-ic demands and the minimum programme in general; — — the C.
C.
resolves: to recognise the continuation of the journal Kommunist as impossible and to declare that t h i s publication is hereby t e r m i n a t e d.
— Furthermore.
With a view to extending the discussion on the controversial questions and to having them clarified before a broader circle of leading comrades, the C.
C.
resolves: to request the three comrades who have signed the theses to draw up a motivated statement of their differ-ences with the C.
O.
Editorial Board.
This statement together with a reply by the C.
O.
Editorial Board shall be communicated to a broader circle of leading Party workers for a final decision on whether it is desirable and necessary to open a debate in the press.
488 I very much regret that you are dragging out this “terribly boring” business.
I repeat— I, too, am terribly bored with hav-ing to repeat— that I must decline to take part in Kommunist.
Your plan lacks principle and tends to confound the confusion.
If there are no profound differences of principle, the submission to the C.
C.
is either slander or intrigue, and you will be exposed by every worker in Russia.
If there are, a s m u c h must be said: after No.
1-2 people have begun to confuse things outrageously; w ed e c l i n e r e s p o n s i b i l i t y ; we believe it to be our duty not to encourage but to expose.
A s a c o n c e s-s i o n we invite (see leaflet) them to have another discussion before an “enlarged circle” (so as not to shame them in the press; not to kill them outright by polemics).
{ That is the only reason.
} For S b o r n i k S o t s i a l -D e m o k r a t a489 we have, apart from a number of our articles, * Varin & Alexander & reports & indictment (I have not yet received it) & Safa-rov & Latvian & Kollontai (probably).
The Japanese 490 should be invited only to be shamed; Bukharin — only order material on the economic question.
Radek should n o t be invited (his article is l e g a l and is not at all important in this shape).
We shall have to fight against his theses.
Here is my opinion.
Kommunist is a corpse and I am not taking part in reviving it.
Alexander (and the Russian workers in the Bureau) should confront them with this question o f p r i n c i p l e: we do not take on the Editorial Board people who confuse things outrageously and refuse to learn, who do not even wish to make an effort to set forth their opinion.
They want to p l a y u s o f f against the P.
S.
D.
, that much is clear, while they themselves are safe on the sidelines.
Kommunist met the task of that period: to rally everyone against social-chauvinism and Kautskyism.
The task now is different : we are faced with a s t r u g g l e against “imperialist E c o n o m i s m”.

published the follow-ing key points of the agenda: P 5.

“problem of peace” M 7a.

International Socialist Bureau.
The I.
S.
C.
has invited the organisations to discuss these questions and to send in their proposals.
Here is the reply of our Party C.
C.
to the invitation: 1.
Just as all war is but a continuation by violent means of the politics which the belligerent states and their ruling classes had been conducting for many years, sometimes for decades, before the outbreak of the war, so the peace that ends any war can be nothing but a consideration and a record of the actual changes brought about in the relations of forces as a result of the given war.
2.
It is therefore the greatest absurdity and stupidity, from the standpoint of theory, and from the standpoint of socialist doctrine, and the greatest fraud on the working class in practice, to engage in talk about assessing the present war on the strength of “simple” concepts of defence and attack and about assessing the future peace on the strength of “simple” pious wishes for a stable, democratic, honourable, etc.
, peace.
3.
This war is an imperialist war, i.
e.
, a war resulting ∃ * See present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
169-79.
—Ed.
∃∃from contradictions on the basis of a highly developed monopoly capitalism which is ripe for transition to social-ism.
This war is being fought for world hegemony, i.
e.
, for fresh oppression of the weak nations, for another division of the world, for a division of the colonies, spheres of influence, etc.
— a division under which the old plundering powers, Britain, France and Russia, would give up a share of their booty to Germany, a young and stronger plunder-ing power.
4.
That is why, unless the proletarian revolution over-throws the present governments and the present ruling classes of the belligerent “great” powers, there is a b s o l u t e l y no chance of a n y peace o t h e r than a more or less short-term armistice between the imperialist powers, a peace accompanied by a growth of reaction within the states, a growth of national oppression and enslavement of the weak nations, a growth of inflammable material preparatory for new wars, etc.
For the fact is that from the objective content of the politics which has been bred by the entire epoch of imperialism and which the bourgeoisie of all the belligerent “great” powers had conducted before t h i s war and is conducting during i t , inevitably flows a peace resting on a new and even worse oppression of nations, etc.
5.
To arouse in the masses of people ideas or hopes of the possibility of a stable or democratic, etc.
, peace between the present governments and the present ruling classes (i.
e.
, the bourgeoisie allied with the landowners), as most of the official socialist parties are doing, is not only shame-lessly to cheat the people but to lull them and distract them from the revolutionary struggle, which is already starting in the form of the strike and demonstration movement.
6.
It is precisely this kind of cheating the people and distracting the proletariat from the revolutionary struggle that characterises the “peace programme” which is now being “unanimously” put forward both by the official spokesman of the Second International Huysmans at the Congress of the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiter Partei of Holland at Arnhem, and by Kautsky, the most influential theorist of the Second International and the most influential advocate of the social-patriots and social-chauvinists in all countries.
Their programme consists in hypocriticallip service to some democratic pious wishes: repudiation of annexations and indemnities, self-determination of na-tions, democratisation of foreign policy, arbitration courts to settle conflicts between states, disarmament, a United States of Europe, etc.
7.
The best evidence that this “peace programme” is downright hypocrisy is, on the one hand, the lip service paid to it by a number of bourgeois pacifists and demagogic ministers of the belligerent countries, and, on the other, its duplication by notorious (notorisch) chauvinists at the conferences of “socialists” of one group of belligerent powers in London (February 1915) 493 and of the other in Vienna (April 1915).
494 It is the “socialists” who have entered the bourgeois ministries carrying on the plunderous war, who have voted for the war credits, who have helped the war by participating in various organisations and institu-tions, etc.
, it is they who are a c t u a l l y conducting the policy of safeguarding the old and new annexations, colonial oppression, etc.
, that have proclaimed to the world their “peace programme”, consisting in a repudiation of annexations, etc.
8.
Kautsky, the leading authority of the Second Inter-national, declared to the whole world on May 21, 1915 (Neue Zeit) that this accord and “unanimity” of “socialists” in London * and in Vienna over the principle of “indepen-dence” or self-determination of nations is proof of the “una-nimity” and “viability” of the Second International in the “peace programme”.
This defence and sanction of the most crying and most brazen hypocrisy and deception of the workers is not in any sense a coincidence, but a systematic policy which is being conducted in a number of countries by men who pretend to be internationalists but are actually making the imperialist war more attractive by applying to it the idea of “defence of one’s country” and consolidating the domination of the working-class movement by the social-chauvinists, who have betrayed socialism, by preach-ing “unity” with them.
This policy, which is the most harmful and dangerous one for the working class, is being conducted by Kautsky, Haase and others in Germany, * An inadvertent mistake in the MS.
, which says “Copenhagen”.

This world-wide policy, which is of the utmost danger to the working class, could be called a Kautskian policy, after its most authoritative spokesman.
9.
Socialists cannot refuse to fight for reform.
They must vote everywhere, including the parliaments, by the way, for all, even the slightest, improvements in the condi-tion of the masses, such as increased relief for the inhabi-tants of the devastated areas, lessening of national oppres-sion, etc.
But on the basis of the p r e s e n t war and the peace flowing from it, this kind of reformist activity to improve the condition of the masses is apparently possible only on a miniature scale.
It would be a crying deception of the masses to suggest to them, whether directly or indi-rectly, the idea that the questions raised by the p r e s e n t war could have a reformist solution.
For t h i s war has created a revolutionary situation in Europe, bringing to the fore the most fundamental problems of imperialism, which will inevitably have an imperialist solution, except where the present governments and ruling classes of Europe are overthrown through revolution.
That is why the principal and fundamental talk of socialists in the struggle for stable and democratic peace must be: first, to explain to the masses the need for revolutionary mass struggle, to spread the idea of it systematically, and to set up the necessary organisations; second, to expose the hypocrisy and falsehood both of the bourgeois pacifist and of the socialist, notably Kautskian, talk about peace and the “unanimity” of the Second Inter-national on the “peace programme”.
Such talk is doubly hypocritical on the part of “socialists” who follow the bourgeoisie in denying the possibility of transforming the present imperialist war into a civil war for socialism, and who oppose any revolutionary work in that direction.
10.
The central point of the currently prevalent hypocri-sy concerning the “peace programme” is the allegedly una-nimous recognition of the struggle against old and new a n n e x a t i o n s .
But those who talk of annexations and the struggle against them either cannot or will not for the most part give thought to what annexation is.
Clearly, annexation will not be the right word for every appropri-ation of “foreign” territory, for, generally speaking, social-ists favour the abolition of frontiers between nations, their getting closer together and integration, and the formation of larger states.
Clearly, not every disturbance of the status quo can be described as annexation, for this would be extremely reactionary and a mockery of the fundamental concepts of the science of history.
Clearly, annexation does not apply to every kind of integration by force of arms, for socialists cannot repudiate violence in the interests of the majority of the population and in the interests of human progress.
Annexation can and must clearly apply only to the appropriation of a territory against the will of the population of that territory.
In other words, the concept of annexation is inseparably bound up with the concept of self-determination of nations.
11.
The present war — precisely because it is an imperial-ist war insofar as both groups of belligerent “great” powers are concerned — inevitably had to and did give rise to the phenomenon of the bourgeoisie and the social-chauvin-ists “fighting” violently against “annexations” w h e n e v e r this is done by an enemy state.
Südekum and his Austro-German friends and defenders, including Haase and Kautsky, are silent about Germany’s annexations in respect of Alsace-Lorraine, Denmark, Poland, etc.
, but very frequently “struggle against the annexations” carried out by Russia in respect of Finland, Poland, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.
, by Britain in respect of India, etc.
On the other band, the British, French, Italian and Russian Südekums, viz.
, Hyndman, Guesde, Vandervelde, Renaudel, Trèves, Plekhanov, Axelrod, Chkheidze & Co.
, are silent about Britain’s annexations in respect of India, France’s in respect of Nice or Morocco, Italy’s in respect of Tripoli or Albania, Russia’s in respect of Poland, the Ukraine, etc.
, but then f o r t h e m o s t p a r t “struggle against the annexations” carried out by Germany.
This kind of “struggle against annexations” on the part of the social-chauvinists and the Kautskians is clearly downright hypocritical, and the bourgeoisie is promoting their struggle both directly, by allocating millions upon millions for chauvinist propaganda, and indirectly, by giving the social-chauvinists and the Kautskians a monopo-ly on legality.
The French “socialists”, who justify war over Alsace-Lorraine, and the German “socialists”, who fail to demand freedom for Alsace-Lorraine to secede from Germany, are clearly both annexationists, no matter how much they swear to the contrary.
The Russian “socialists”, who talk or write against the “disintegration of Russia” or now, directly or indirectly, justify the war over who is to enslave Poland, in the name of the “peace without annexations” slogan, are clearly annexationists as well, etc.
, etc.
12.
If the “struggle against annexations” is not to become an empty phrase or a revolting hypocrisy, socialists must: f i r s t , explain to the masses that it is necessary to wage revolutionary struggle for the proletariat’s winning of political power and for a socialist revolution which stems from all the conditions of the imperialist epoch and the pres-ent imperialist war and which alone can fully secure the self-determination of nations everywhere, i.
e.
, liberate the oppressed nations, bring the nations closer together and effect their fusion not on the basis of violence, but on the basis of equality and accord between the proletariat and the working people of all nations; s e c o n d , they must immediately start the most extensive propaganda and agitation against the veiled chauvinism and annexationism of the official socialist parties, especially of those of the “great” powers.
Socialists must explain to the masses that a socialist and an internationalist only in name but a chau-vinist and an annexationist in fact is the English social-ist who fails at once to struggle for freedom to secede for Ireland, India, etc.
— the French socialist who fails to struggle for the freedom of the French colonies, against the war to annex Alsace and Lorraine, etc.
— the German social-ist who fails to struggle for freedom to secede for Alsace-Lorraine, the Danes, the Poles, the Belgians, the Serbs, etc.
— the Russian socialist who fails to struggle for freedomto secede for the Ukraine, Finland, etc.
, against the war over Poland — the Italian socialist who fails to struggle for freedom to secede for Tripoli, Albania, etc.
— the Dutch socialist who fails to struggle for freedom to secede and independence for the Dutch East Indies — the Polish social-ist who fails to struggle for the full freedom and equality of the Jews and the Ukrainians oppressed by the Poles, etc.
13.
From the Zimmerwald Manifesto and the I.
S.
C.
circular of February 10, 1916 (Bulletin No.
3) 496 inevitably flows the proposition that all “war against war” and “strug-gle for peace” is hypocrisy unless it is indissolubly bound up with immediate revolutionary mass struggle, and with its propaganda and preparation.
But this conclusion must be stated straightforwardly and explicitly.
We must, first, explain to the masses where the development of revolution-ary mass struggle in the conditions of a European war can and must (muß) lead.
It leads inevitably to the transforma-tion of the imperialist war into a civil war for socialism.
A hint of this is given in all the speeches saying that the workers should die for their own cause rather than an alien one.
But hints are not enough.
The great, even if perhaps not very near, goal must be clearly set before the masses.
They must know where to go and why.
Second, if we call on the masses to fight against their governments, “regard-less of the military position of the given country”, we thereby not only repudiate the admissibility of “defending the country”, as a principle, in the present war, but admit the desirability of defeat for every bourgeois government in order to transform its defeat into revolution.
That, too, must be squarely put: revolutionary mass struggle cannot become an international one unless its conscious represent-atives unite openly for the purpose of defeating and over-throwing all bourgeois governments.
Third — and this is the most important thing — it is impossible to conduct any revolutionary mass struggle without setting up everywhere, not only at the top, but also among the masses, an illegal organisation for its propaganda and preparation, and discussion of its course and conditions.
Since there have been street demonstrations in Germany, since there have been a number of letters from the front-lines in France urging against subscription to the war loan, since therehave been mass strikes in Britain, to say nothing of Russia, then, to promote this struggle, to help consolidate it on an international scale, it is absolutely necessary to shed light on e v e r y step along that road in a free, i.
e.
, i l l e g a l , press, to verify the successes, to weigh their conditions, to strengthen and develop the struggle.
Without an illegal organisation and an illegal press, recognition of “mass action” will remain (as it has remained in Switzerland) an empty phrase.
* 14.
On the question of the socialists’ parliamentary action, it must be borne in mind that the Zimmerwald resolution not only expresses sympathy for the five Social-Democratic deputies of the Duma, who belong to our Party, and who have been sentenced to exile in Siberia, but also expresses its solidarity with their tactics.
It is impossible to recognise the revolutionary struggle of the masses while being content with exclusively legal, exclusively reformist activity of socialists in parliament; this can only arouse legitimate dissatisfaction among the workers and cause them to desert Social-Democracy for anti-parliamentary anarch-ism or syndicalism.
It must be stated clearly and publicly that Social-Democratic members of parliament must use their position not only to make speeches in parliament, but also to render all possible aid outside parliament to the underground organisation and the revolutionary struggle of the workers, and that the masses themselves, through their illegal organisation, must supervise the activity of their leaders.
15.
The question of calling the International Socialist Bureau, placed on the agenda of the Second International Socialist Conference, which is being convened, inevitably raises a more fundamental question of principle, as to whether the old parties and the Second International can be united.
The more extensive the mass sympathy for the Zimmerwald association, the more incomprehensible to the masses, the more harmful for the development of their strug-gle become the inconsistency and timidity of the stand which essentially identifies the old parties and the Second Inter-national with the bourgeois policy in the working-class movement (see the Zimmerwald Manifesto and the I.
S.
C.
* Points 12 and 13 are crossed out in the MS.
—Ed.
circular of February 10, 1916), while fearing a split with them and promising to dissolve the I.
S.
C.
as soon as the old International Socialist Bureau meets.
Such a promise was never voted on and was not discussed even at Zimmerwald.
The six months since Zimmerwald have made it even clearer that a split is inevitable, that the work which the Zimmerwald Manifesto recommends cannot be conducted in unity with the old parties, and that fear of a split is a brake on every step along that way.
In Germany it is not only the I.
S.
D.
group that has condemned the fear of a split and has openly come out against the hypocrisy of the apostles of unity, but also Otto Rühle, a member of the Reichstagsfrak-tion * and Karl Liebknecht’s closest friend, who has openly come out for a split.
Nor was Vorwärts capable of putting forward against Rühle a single serious or honest argument.
In France, member of the Socialist Party Bourderon spoke against a split, but in fact motioned a resolution at the Congress which “désapprouve (disavows) the C.
A.
P (Comité Administratif Permanent= the party C.
C.
) and the G.
P.
” (Groupe Parlementaire=the parliamentary group).
Adoption of such a resolution would clearly signify an immediate and unconditional split in the party.
In Britain even T.
Russel Williams, writing in the moderate Labour Leader, repeatedly and openly admitted the inevitability of a split, and re-ceived support from a number of party members.
In America, where the Socialist Party is formally united, some of its members have come out for militarism and war (so-called preparedness), and others, including Eugene Debs, a former presidential candidate from the Socialist Party, openly preach civil war for socialism in connection with the coming war.
Actually, there is already a split throughout the world, and ignoring this fact would merely harm the Zimmerwald-ists, making them ridiculous in the eyes of the masses, who are very well aware that every step of t h e i r work in the Zimmerwald spirit means a continuation and deepening of the split.
We must have the courage openly to recognise the inev-* Parliamentary group.
—Ed.
itable and the actual, to abandon any harmful illusions about the possibility of unity with the “defenders of their country” in the present war, and to help the masses escape the influence of the leaders who “are misleading them” (see the I.
S.
C.
circular of February 10, 1916) or are hatching a “plot” (Pakt) against socialism through an “amnesty”.
That is our proposal on the item of the agenda concerning the convocation of the International Socialist Bureau at The Hague.
* * * Reformist phrases are the main means of deceiving the people at a time when the objective situation has placed on the agenda of history the greatest world crisis, which, regardless of the will of the various parties, can either be deferred and postponed until the next imperialist war or resolved through socialist revolution.
It is neither chance nor the ill will of the several governments or the capitalists of some country but the entire development of bourgeois relations that has led to imperialism and the present impe-rialist war.
Similarly, it is neither chance nor the result of any demagogy or agitation but the objective conditions of the crisis brought about by the war and the sharpening of class contradictions that now generate strikes, demonstra-tions and other similar manifestations of mass revolutionary struggle in a number of belligerent countries.
Objectively, the question can only be put like this: are we to help this, still weak but intrinsically powerful and deep-going discontent and movement of the masses, which may develop into a socialist revolution, or are we to conduct a policy of helping the bourgeois governments (Durchhaltspolitik, politique jusquauboutiste * )? The real meaning of the sweet talk about democratic peace consists exclusively in help to the governments through the hypocri-tical stunning and fooling of the masses.
* * * This war has brought to the fore the basic problems of imperialism, i.
e.
, of the very existence of capitalist society, * The policy of continuing the war to a victorious end.
—Ed.
and it would be quackery to suggest to the people, directly or indirectly, that these problems can have a reformist solu-tion.
It is a question of a redivision of the world correspond-ing to the new balance of power between the capitalist states, which in the last few decades have been developing not only very fast, but also — and this is especially impor-tant — very unevenly.
On the basis of capitalist social rela-tions, this new redivision of the world is impossible other-wise than through wars and violence.
The objective state of things rules out any reformist solution for the ripe contradic-tions, it rules out any other way out except a series of imperialist wars or a socialist revolution of the proletariat, the conditions for whose success have already been created precisely by this epoch of imperialism.
Real political activity in the given circumstances is possible only as this alternative: either to help your “own” national bourgeoisie plunder other countries or to help the beginning.

The men with whom you want to re-establish the International are dead, they no longer exist, not literally, but politically.
2 If Grimm thinks that everyone should not vote separate-ly, we are quite willing to have the voting by groups.
The last thing we want to do is to impose our will, but we want the voting to take place; after that we shall willingly take part in the work of the committees.
3 The question would have been solved long ago, if a vote had been taken.
It is highly unfair that after many days of work together we have to forego the vote.
After all, the vote would take no more than 5 minutes! Martov’s proposal is acceptable without objections.

declaration at Zimmerwald shows that in opposing the right of nations to self-determination, the Polish Social-Democrats wish to say something quite different from what they are actually saying.
They want to say that not every movement for national independence deserves Social-Democratic support.
That is unquestionable both because any democratic demand is subordinate to the common interests of the proletariat’s class struggle, without being at all absolute, and because in the epoch of imperi-alist rivalries to dominate the nations there may well be open and secret alliances between the bourgeoisie of an oppressed country and an oppressor country.

(2) Unconditional rejection of all war credits and demands both in time of peace and of war, and with a motivation of principle.
Impose the duty of doing this on the party’s representatives in parliament and in all other state insti-tutions.
(3) Struggle in all the party’s propaganda and agita-tion — above all in practical activity — against all military establishments, and repudiation of all military duties to the bourgeois class state.
(4) Systematic transition by the party to revolutionary struggle and revolutionary tactics all along the line, instead of being confined to reformism in practical activity.
(5) Adoption of the work and activity of Karl Liebknecht and the whole Spartacus group in Germany 506 as a model of the only international activity, of real struggle against the war and all wars, and emulation of their example.
(6) Struggle by means of propaganda, agitation and organisation against the social-patriots (i.
e.
, “defenders of their country ” ) and reformists (i.
e.
, opponents of the immediate application of revolutionary means of struggle) within the Swiss Socialist Party.
(7) Explaining to the masses that all solemn declarations against militarism and war inevitably come to empty talk without a complete change in the party’s structure and activ-ity and without control by the resolute opponents of social-patriotism and reformism of all the posts in the socialist-political and also trade union, consumer and all other working-class organisations.
(8) Propaganda and preparation of a vigorous revolution-ary mass struggle (demonstrations, strikes and so on, depending on the growth of the overall revolutionary strug-gle) for the purposes of the proletarian revolution as the only means of doing away with wars.
(9) Explaining to the masses that in case of necessity they must themselves set up from below special organisations for such struggle adapted to the hard conditions of wartime.
(10) Making sure that the party’s revolutionary tasks in the struggle against the high cost of living, war, etc.
, are known and clear to every section of the exploited people outside the party.
(11) Systematic propaganda in this context among young people of pre-conscription age, and also in the army, etc.
Written in German in late November-early December 1 9 1 6 First published in 1 9 3 1 in Lenin Miscellany XVII Printed from the original Translated from the German REMARKS ON AN ARTICLE ABOUT MAXIMALISM 507 Page 6 (Paragraph 2).
Here there should be an insertion saying that Potresov has now in fact disavowed these proposi-tions (of Kautsky & Hilferding, etc.
) containing a repudia-tion of reformism in principle.
Potresov has become a reformist.
(It is not right to confine oneself to the statement: “we have never had the intention of proving”; this should be put forward as p r o v e d , and Potresov should be challenged: you and especially Maslov & Co.
of Dyelo 508 have in fact, but tacitly, like cowards, altogether gone over from this position to reformism.
) Page 7 (end of § I) “mass action”?? It would be better to put this otherwise, without using this word which has the fault that, being largely caused by the G e r m a n censor-ship (a pseudonym for revolution), it tends to obscure the concept of revolution.
(There will have to be a reckoning on this later with Pannekoek & Radek & Co.
!! Here is an example: there is no German censorship in Switzerland and here the term “mass action” has a l r e a d y brought about confusion which the reformists find useful.
) But that is not the main thing.
The main point is in your idea, which is basically incorrect, that “those of its (minimum programme) demands .
.
.
add up to a transition to a basically different social system” (page 7, § II, e t a l.
) (idem, p.
9).
That is quite wrong!! N e v e r is a “transition to a basical-ly different social system” achieved e i t h e r by the definite demands of the minimum programme (“those of its demands”) o r t h e s u m t o t a l of the minimum-programme demands.
To think so is to move over to the reformist position in principle and to abandon the stand-point of the socialist revolution.
The minimum programme is one which is in principle com-patible with capitalism and does not go beyond its framework.
You may have wanted to say that where society is objec-tively mature for socialism, the implementation of the s u m t o t a l of the minimum-programme demands w o u l d p r o d u c e socialism.
But even that is not so.
The only thing that can be said is that it is most probable in practice that out of any serious struggle for the major minimum-programme demands t h e r e w i l l f l a r e u p a struggle for socialism and that we, at any rate, are work-ing in that direction.
Another thing should not be forgotten, and this is some-thing Pannekoek & Radek do forget, namely, that imperi-alism is the exploitation of hundreds of millions in the dependent nations by a handful of very rich nations.
Hence, the possibility of full democracy inside the richest nation with its continued domination over dependent nations.
That was the state of things in ancient Greece on the basis of slavery.
That is how things now stand with New Zealand and Britain.
(By the way: page 8 is not good.
That’s not the way to put it.
For instance, in the epoch of imperialism and the high cost of living “bread” is precisely the thing you will not get through reform alone.
Page 8 — defence against Potresov’s charge.
The thing to do is not to defend yourself, but to attack: you c o n f i n e y o u r s e l f to reforms, as the liberals did in Russia in 1904.
) Page 10 — in 1905, the liberals c o n f i n e d t h e m -s e l v e s to reforms; we demanded, preached, prepared, etc.
, the revolution.
Here it is not a question of “concreteness”, but of the basic principle (essence) of any revolution: displacement of the old class and winning of “all power” (der Macht) by the new class.
(Page 10 bottom — you deal with the proletarian “reform” in a terribly clumsy and imprudent way, although you do want to say: “revolution”!! What you should say is perhaps: “As in Russia in 1904 it is not reforms but a r e f o r m .
”) Page 11 is all quite wrong.
Imperialism will produce both the 8-hour working day and the “arming of the people”against the socialist revolution.
That is precisely the point over which the struggle will not unfold.
And, in general, it will not be over the minimum programme.
Imperialism will produce “Bulygin Dumas” and reforms against the revolution.
We shall be for the revolution.
“The most important questions of the present day” will n o t be and are n o t those you name, but the high cost of living (1) & (2) imperialist wars.
Reforms are powerless against the high cost of living (in the presence of the trusts, etc.
), as they were against the autocracy in Russia in 1904-05.
You have incorrectly put the question of reform, and of the minimum programme, and of democracy.
6 I very strongly recommend rewriting it, confining yourself, for the time being (for a small article in Voprosy Strakhovaniya), to the antithesis: You, Mr.
Potresov, are a full-fledged r e f o r m i s t , you confine yourself to “reforms”, you h a v e f o r g o t t e n the significance and meaning of the “formula”: “not reforms, but a reform”, the significance and meaning of the quoted statements by Kautsky & Hilferding & & Bauer, etc.
Dyelo= ideologically quite mature or-gan of reformism, of the bourgeois labour party.
The “three pillars” 509 before the revolution were an extension of the struggle for reform.
And that is exactly how the question is formulated in the Manifesto of the Zimmerwald Left: all struggle for reform must be channeled and transformed into struggle for revolution.
I do not think self-determination of nations should be set out as the “most important” in general: in so doing you go miles beyond what we have been saying until now.
By coming out in this way you would force me to join up against you with — oh, horrible thought! — Bukharin!!! Isn’t it better to leave this question aside for the time being, rewriting the article à la 6 — and to work out some-thing in the form of theses, let us say, on the attitude to the minimum programme, etc.
, for dispatch to the Bureau, etc.
? 6 Phrases about “maximalism” are nothing but attacks by a reformist on the revolutionaries (“opponents of reformismin principle” for the censorship).
In general, it is an exceptionally difficult thing and heikle sehr heikle Sache!!* to treat of s u c h a question in the censored press.

It should be altered: 1) add about imperialism as the final stage of capi-talism 2) about the imperialist war, imperialist wars and “defence of one’s country” & bis: about the struggle and the split with the social-chauvinists NB 3) add about the state, the kind we need, and about the w i t h e r i n g a w a y of the state.

4) Change two last paragraphs before the political programme (against the monarchy in general and measures to restore it) 5) add to § 3 of the political section: no officials from the top (cf.
Engels in his criticism of 1891 518) & salaries to all officials: not higher than workers’ wages & right to recall all deputies and officials at any time & 5 bis) correct § 9 on self-determination & international character of socialist revolution in detail 6) correct and r a i s e many things in minimum programme.
7) In agrarian programme: (α) nationalisation instead of municipalisation (I shall send my MS.
on this, which was burnt in 1909,519 to St.
Petersburg) (β) model farms on landed estates.
8) “Universal labour service” (Zivildienstpflicht) 9) cross out support for “every o p p o s i t i o n” movement (a revolutionary one is a different matter).
10) Change name, because (α) it is wrong (β) it has been fouled by the social-chauvinists (γ) it will confuse the people at the elections, because the Social-Democrats= Chkheidze, P o t -r e s o v & Co.

Instead of an interview, the arrivals have handed through Politiken a communiqué on the trip to the press and the public.
The most important thing for us is to arrive in Russia as soon as possible, Lenin said warmly.
Every day counts.
The governments have done everything to hamper this trip.
Did you meet any of the comrades from the German party? No.
Wilhelm Jansson from Berlin tried to meet us at Lingen on the Swiss border.
But Platten refused permission, giving a friendly hint that he wished to spare Jansson the unpleasantness of such a meeting.

STRÖM, A SPOKESMAN OF THE LEFT -WING SWEDISH SOCIAL -DEMOCRATS MARCH 31 (APRIL 13), 1917 It is a downright invention to say that Frederik Ström, allegedly contrary to the wishes of the Russians, had prevented a representa-tive of Socialdemokraten 521 from attending the conference.
To Ström’s question, Lenin replied: We have absolutely no trust in Mr.
Branting.
If you have trust in him, you are free to invite his representative.
Politiken No, 8 6 , April 1 5 , 1 9 1 7 Printed from the Politiken text Translated from the SwedishRUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARIES’ TRIP ACROSS GERMANY COMMUNIQUÉ OF THE GROUP 522 The Russian revolutionaries who arrived in Stockholm on Friday morning handed to Politiken for publication the following official communiqué concerning their trip: Britain, which officially welcomed the Russian revolu-tion with “joy in her heart”, at once did everything to nullify one of the results of the revolution — the political amnesty.
The British Government does not allow transit to Russia for Russian revolutionaries who live abroad and who oppose the war.
When this had been proved beyond doubt — this fact has been confirmed by numerous documents which will be made public in the very near future, and Russian socialists of all trends have stated as much in a unanimous resolution — a section of the Russian Party comrades decided to try to return from Switzerland to Russia via Germany and Sweden.
Fritz Platten, Secretary of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party and the leader of its Left Wing, a well-known internationalist and anti-militarist, conducted nego-tiations with the German Government.
For their trip the Russian Party comrades demanded the right of extraterrito-riality (no inspection of passports or luggage; no officials allowed into their car).
The group of those who travelled could include anyone, regardless of political views, provided the Russians themselves approved of his candidature.
The Russian Party comrades declared that in return they would demand the release of Austrian and German civilians interned in Russia.
The German Government accepted the terms, and 30 Rus-sian Party comrades, men and women, left Gottmadingen on April 9, including Lenin and Zinoviev, editors of Sotsial-Demokrat, the Central Organ of Russian Social-Democracy; Mikha Tskhakaya, editor of Nachalo523 in Paris and a found-er of the Caucasian Social-Democratic organisation, who had earlier brought Chkheidze into the party, and also several members of the Jewish Workers’ Union.
Fritz Platten was in charge of the trip and he alone conducted all the necessary negotiations with the representatives of the German Govern-ment who accompanied the train.
During the three-day crossing of Germany, the Russian Party comrades did not leave their car.
The agreement was strictly honoured by the German authorities.
On the 12th instant, the Russians arrived in Sweden.
Before their departure from Switzerland, a record was made of all the preparations for the trip.
Having studied this document, Henri Guilbeaux, representing the French Social-Democratic group “Vie Ouvrière” and editor of Demain 524 ; a leader of the radical French opposition in Paris, whose name cannot now be divulged 525; Paul Hartstein, a member of the radical German opposition; M.
Bronski, representing Russian-Polish Social-Democracy, and Fritz Platten signed a statement voicing their full approval of the way in which the Russian Party comrades had acted.

If the workers of all countries of the world vote for the loans issued by their bourgeois governments to wage the imperialist war, it will be impossible to find a way out of the horrors of the war, and all talk about the fraternalsolidarity of the proletariat of the world, about internation-alism, etc.
, will come to nothing but hypocrisy.
The coupling of votes for the loan with wishes, statements, declarations, etc.
, in favour of peace without annexations is especially clear evidence of the disastrous discrepancy between word and deed, which has destroyed the Second International.
Until political and economic power has passed into the hands of the proletariat and the poor sections of the peasantry, and while the aim of the war is determined by the interests of capital, the workers reject any new loans aimed not for but against Russia’s revolutionary freedom.
Recognising at the same time that the supply of the army with all necessities calls for resources, and not wishing to leave their brothers without bread for a single hour, the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies believes that the cost of the capitalist war should be borne by the capitalists who have reaped and continue to reap billions of rubles in profits on this war, and insists that the necessary money should come exclusively from the pockets of the bourgeoisie and the landowners.

A revolutionary-democratic dictatorship has beenestablished but not in the form we envisaged: it is inter-locked with the dictatorship of the imperialist bourgeoisie.
The imperialist war has confused everything, turning the rabid opponents of the revolution — the Anglo-French capi-talists — into supporters of the revolution for victory (the same applies to the top army command and counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie).
It is this unique historical concurrence of circumstances that has brought about a dual dictatorship: the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the dictatorship of revolutionary democracy.
In organisational terms, the people have never managed to keep abreast of the bourgeoisie; in Russia the people have set up their own organised power without hav-ing achieved political independence.
Hence, the dual power, the unconsciously trusting attitude on the part of the petty-bourgeois majority of the soldier masses and a section of the workers to the Provisional Government, and the voluntary submission of revolutionary democracy to the bourgeois dictatorship.
The specific feature of the present situation is that lack of political awareness on the part of the masses is preventing the establishment of a stable and conscious majority on the side of the proletarian policy (all other political trends have gone over entirely to the petty-bour-geois position).
The revolutionary democracy is an assembly of the most diverse elements (in terms of class status and interests, which is not the same thing at all!).
Their strati-fication: in the countryside — the well-to-do peasants, who have been strengthened by the November 9 law, and the poor, one-horse and horseless peasants, and in the towns — the sections close to the working class and the petty pro-prietors; the separation of the proletarians and the semi-proletarians from the petty bourgeoisie is inevitable, but the consolidation of the propertied elements in the revolu-tionary bloc may well advance to a point where it will pre-vail over the organisation of the masses rallying round the proletarian slogans.
It is quite possible, therefore, that power will remain in the hands of the bourgeoisie, and that there will be no transfer of power to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
The conclusion: we are not faced with the task of overthrowing the Provisional Govern-ment — it rests on the confidence of the petty-bourgeois anda section of the workers’ masses — but with that of painstak-ing explanation of the class tasks and organisation.

I think that in its final wording the resolution will be put before the general Party conference, and I now move that it be read out in its present form.
The resolution consists of three parts: 1) objective causes of the war, 2) revolutionary defencism, and 3) how to end the war.

Who is saying all this? Who is spreading these lies and slander? Soldiers and workers who read the working-class news-papers are aware that a decision of the Soviet which was taken after a hearing of the report by Comrade Zinovievand Comrade Zurabov on how we managed to make our way across Germany, was published in Izvestia Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh Deputatovs 529 No.
32, of April 5, 1917.
Did the Soviet reprimand us? No.
What did the Soviet say? It replied that it wanted the Provisional Government to take urgent measures for the unhampered passage to Russia of all Russian political exiles living abroad.
Comrade Lenin then stated that until now the Provisional Government has failed to take any measures and that our socialist comrades living abroad could not return to Russia.
Why? Simply because Britain, who has a stake in this fratricidal slaughter, has refused to allow passage for our socialist comrades, socialists who have declared war against war and demand peace.
The British are keeping in prison one of their own British socialists, 530 and have also arrested and imprisoned our Comrade Trotsky, who was Chairman of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies in 1905.
But that is precisely what has been done by all the capi-talist and landowner governments favouring this war: the French, the German and the Italian governments have thrown all anti-war socialists into prison and are keeping them there.
Was it possible in the circumstances to travel via Bri-tain? No.
That is why we had to apply to the Swiss socialist Platten, who also favours peace.
What was the upshot of this? Lenin and those who travelled with him were let through, but our witness, Comrade Platten, who could testify that we had had no contacts with the Germans, was not allowed to come to Russia.
What is the point of all this? It is that this war, which is now taking hundreds of thousands of lives a month, is being waged by the capita-lists — they stand to gain from the war, they are profiting from it, and that is why all those who want peace and work for it are being imprisoned by the capitalists of all countries, including the brigand and plunderer Wilhelm, who spread lies and slander about the socialists.
Comrade Lenin then went on to give a detailed explana-tion of the causes of the war and its aims.
He showed thatthe working class and the poor peasants have never wanted and do not want this or any other war.
He also spoke in detail about the nature of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and of the Provisional Government, on which the industrialist Guchkov and the landowners have seats.
Support and help should not go to the Provisional Govern-ment, but to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which is the only legitimate government and which alone expresses the people’s interests.
Soldatskaya Pravda No.
2 April 1 8 (May 1 ), 1 9 1 7 Printed from the Soldatskaya Pravda text MEETING OF THE SOLDIERS ’ SECTION OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET OF WORKERS ’ AND SOLDIERS ’ DEPUTIES A P R I L 1û (30 ) , 191û 531 1 SPEECH ON THE RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMISSION OF THE SOVIET OF SOLDIERS’ DEPUTIES Lenin says that he has read the resolution of the Executive Commission and the Committee on his activity and has decided to insert his article on this resolution in Pravda; just now he wishes to reply briefly to the charges being levelled against him.
He finds that there are four questions to which he wants to reply: 1) formal question, 2) question of land, 3) of the government, 4) of the war.
On the first question he welcomes the silence of the resolu-tion on his trip across Germany, as it shows that the Commis-sion has taken the standpoint of both sections of the Com-mittee, which say nothing about it.
He reads an extract from the resolution: “.
.
.
considers the propaganda of so-called Leninists, etc.
” and declares that he assumes full responsibility for the Leninists’ propaganda.
To reply to this charge in the resolution, the three above-mentioned questions must be examined.
He goes on to explain thesequestions.
On the question of land — he favours the transfer of all land to the use of the working masses without redemp-tion; he speaks about the transfer by decision of peasant committees, and refers to Shingaryov’s telegram, which says that the taking away of land is an arbitrary act.
That is wrong because it has been done by decision of the village committees, which makes the seizure legal.
It is naive to think that the peasants can be influenced by sermons from Petrograd; that is impossible.
The question of land will be decided on the spot.
The land should be taken over right away, in view of the looming famine.
Voluntary agreement with the landowners is an absurdity, you cannot have an agreement between 300 peasant families and one landowner, which is the ratio we now have in European Russia.
(A proposal is motioned to limit the speaker’s time.
State-ments are made for and against; by a vote the time is limited to 30 minutes.
) Lenin says that if the meeting wishes it, he could alter the time of the explanations, but could also be through within 20 minutes.
On the state structure and administration he says that we need a people’s republic, and not one with officials, capitalists and troops.
Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Farm Labourers’ Deputies, from top to bottom, that is the ideal of administration.
The people must have the power.
On the question of the war he says that he has never spoken about the draft reinforcements and knows nothing of the question at all.
532 That is why he speaks only about the war.
Our government consists only of capitalists, the war is being waged to benefit the capitalists, and the war can be ended only through a revolution by the workers’ masses.
The obligations undertaken by our allies are predatory, they deal only with a sharing of the spoils; annexation is connected with capital, and cannot be repudiated until capital is taken over.
He holds the capitalists in Germany to be the same as our own capitalists, and says that Wilhelm is a bloodsucker and, of course, there can be no question of a separate peace with him — that is absurd.
The capital-ists started the war and cannot end it — there is need for a workers’ revolution to end the war.
The Leninists areagainst any separate peace.
They said as much back in 1915.
They said that the proletariat, once it takes power, and publishes all the treaties, must offer peace to the whole world.
* If anyone rejects such peace, the proletariat will start a revolutionary war.
Only a revolution by workers in several countries can put an end to the war.
Universal peace can be achieved only through a workers’ revolution, The practical method of ending the war is fraternisation at the front, and strengthening the power of the Soviet of Workers’, Peasants’ and Farm Labourers’ Deputies.
That is the only way to bring about the workers’ revolution and universal peace.
2 REPLIES TO QUESTIONS 1) The reconquest of Kurland is annexation, because in that case Germany is entitled to reconquer her colonies.
The people must be left to decide for themselves how they want to live.
In the capitalist world the sharing out is according to strength — the stronger get more.
It is not worth while fighting over Kurland, but it is worth while fighting for Kurland’s freedom to decide whom she wants to join.
2) On the seizure of banks and money.
He urges that the seizures should not be arbitrary but by decision of the majority.
(Shouts from the audience: “Your doctrine leads to a primitive state”.
) — No! (Question: “What is to be done if other countries want peace?”) — Advance of the workers’ revolution and fraternisation at the front.
Tactics — we must see how life goes forward.
The experi-ence of life is the best thing.
We must develop the Russian revolution in such a way that the workers’, peasants’ and farm labourers’ deputies have the power.
(Another question: “Is that what you preached in Germany? We, that is, Zinoviev and I, published a pamphlet 533 abroad, in which we said precisely what we are saying now; we published it in German and the German socialists circulated it in Germany.

Printed from a typewritten copy of the minutesTHE ATTENTION OF COMRADES! Comrades Lashevich, Krymov and Mavrin, authorised by the Bolshevik group of the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, request us to declare that the overwhelming majority of the workers who took part in the manifestations on April 20 and 21 and carried “Down with the Provisional Government!” placards, understood this slogan to mean exclusively that all power should be transferred to the Soviets and that the workers want to take over only after winning a majority in the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
The present composition of the Soviet does not quite express the will of the majority of the workers’ and soldiers’ masses.
That is why the Bolshevik group believes that the C.
C.
resolution of April 22 does not give a precise characteristic of the present state of affairs.
From the Editors.
It goes without saying that the C.
C.
resolution is in no sense aimed against the organisers of the mass demonstrations, and that such an interpretation of the slogan rules out any idea of thoughtlessness or adventur-ism.
At any rate, the peaceful and impressively massive character of these manifestations is to the great credit of these comrades as representing the organisers of the mani-festations.
They alone organised a fitting rebuff to the bour-geoisie, which was demonstrating in favour of its own Provisional Government.

3 9 Printed from the Pravda text POGROM AGITATION IN MINISTERIAL NEWSPAPER The ministerial gentlemen, having secured a fresh expres-sion of confidence on the part of the majority of the Soviet leaders, have started a fresh offensive against Pravda and against our Party.
Rech, the ministerial newspaper, has adopted the worst methods of Russkaya Volya.
534In today’s two editorials, the ministerial newspaper, rehearsing the Russkaya Volya elements, does enough lying for two papers.
“The whole” (sic) “of Petrograd has awakened; it has gone out into the street and has loudly and solemnly proclaimed its confidence in the Provisional Government.
” “The whole” of Petrograd! — the ministerial paper will have nothing less.
.
.
.
If from the “whole” of Petrograd we subtract all the workers, who demonstrated against the Provisional Government, if we subtract the vast majority of the soldiers who went out into the street and demonstrated against the Provisional Government, if we subtract the hundreds of thousands of people who simply stayed at home, if the “whole” of Petrograd is taken to mean an insignificant minority of the bourgeoisie, a small section of the students, and a section of the senior army officers — then the minister-ial paper is right: the “whole” of Petrograd has come out for the Guchkovs and the Milyukovs.
.
.
.
Relying on the “whole” of Petrograd (remember the Potemkin villages! 535 ), the ministerial newspaper launches directly into pogrom baiting against us.
“.
.
.
These shots by some armed men, these killings of soldiers, in connection with the unprecedentedly brazen flying of the defeatist flags from the German embassy.
.
.
.
Yesterday’s bloody outrages by the Leninists have worn thin everyone’s tolerance and have dealt an irreparable blow to this anti-national treasonable propaganda.
Let us hope that this propaganda will never again dare to rear its head.
” Let the reader judge where the brazenness lies.
Every word there is lies and slander.
Our comrades did not fly any flags at all from the German embassy.
Our comrades are not to blame for the killings of the soldiers.
Responsi-bility for yesterday’s acts of violence falls on the Provisional Government and no one else.
Let the reader judge whose propaganda is really trea-sonable.

In Borgbjerg’s proposal we have a political fact of excep-tional importance which imposes on us the duty of exposing the social-chauvinists and launching a political campaign.
The British and French “socialists” have rejected Borgbjerg’s proposal.
The British and French Plekhanovs are not coming to this conference.
Borgbjerg’s proposals are a farce.
Through Borgbjerg, the German social-chauvinists are offering their terms for peace.
They are doing this through a socialist in order to cover up their social-chauvinist intrigue.
This must be exposed, to discourage them from ever again applying to the socialist parties.
There can be no doubt at all that this is a proposal coming from the German Government, which is acting through its own social-chauvinists.
It is the one that is arranging this congress.
.
.
.
It cannot do so openly, and is therefore doing it through its own Plekhanovs.
By this diplomatic step the German Government sheds all responsibility while propounding through them its secret hopes.
Let me read you a report in a foreign paper about Borgbjerg: “Through a Danish social-chauvinist, the German Kaiser wants to call a peace conference in his own interests.
” Borgbjerg’s proposal is clearly nothing but a fraud and a swindle.
Then we have a report from Rabochaya Gazeta.
538 (Reads out the report from “Rabochaya Gazeta” of April 5, 1917 .
) It is beyond doubt, therefore? that this is a proposal from the German Government.
That is how such things are done.
It is our task to expose the inner workings of this to theworld, i.
e.
, pass a detailed resolution, translate it into several languages and publish it in all the papers.
I move a draft resolution.
It is a curious fact that the capitalist newspapers are maintaining a diplomatic silence.
They know the rule, that speech is silvern and silence is golden.
The bourgeois newspapers know what the whole thing is about.
Newspapers like Rabochaya Gazeta are at a loss.
Yedinstvo 539 alone has said that Borgbjerg is an agent of the German Government.
But by saying in the next breath that neither the British nor the French social-chauvinists, nor the Rus-sian Plekhanovs will attend this conference under any circumstances, it exposes the British, French and Russian governments, who, being aware of the really difficult con-dition of Germany, hope to fill their appetites at her expense.
We must expose this comedy of masques.
We must tell how such things are done: Bethmann-Hollweg goes to Wilhelm, Wilhelm summons Scheidemann, Scheidemann goes to Denmark, and as a result, Borgbjerg goes to Russia with the peace terms.
(Reads out the resolution.
) Trier is a Danish Marxist.
Denmark is a petty-bourgeois country.
Her bourgeoisie has battened on the war and hates the workers.
The leaders of the Danish Social-Democratic majority are among the most opportunist in Europe.
They have clearly exposed themselves as real social-chauvinists.
We, for our part, must be fair and say about Borgbjerg what we have said about Plekhanov.
If we hear fine phrases shouted to us about Alsace-Lorraine, we must remember that the whole thing boils down to money.
In fact, it is a question of unusually rich ores.
It is a question of profit, a peaceful sharing out of the booty between the German and the French capitalists.
The Danish internationalists have rejected this.
I forgot to say that the Kautskyites have agreed to attend the conference, and this must be exposed.
The proposal coming via Borgbjerg says that the German capitalists are bargaining, because they are inca-pable of holding on to what they have seized.
Germany’s position is desperate, she is on the brink of ruin.
But the German capitalists still hope to retain a bit.
The diplomatists have strong bonds with each other, they know everything, everything is clear to them.
The people alone are not toldsuch things.
The Anglo-French chauvinists have refused to attend the conference because they are very well aware of the real state of affairs.
There was good reason for their taking ministerial office.
It is now a matter of strangulating and plundering Germany, for she is no longer capable of conducting a policy of aggrandizement.
Borgbjerg is an agent of German imperialism.
If the soldiers receive this resolution they will understand that it is now a question of squeezing the last breath out of Germany.
Congresses are farces attended by social-chauvinist diplomatists.
There is the congress, and in the next room they will be sharing out Alsace-Lorraine.
The truth about congresses must be told once and for all, to open the people’s eyes.
If we adopt this manifesto and have it printed, translated into foreign languages and circulated among the workers and soldiers, they will understand the real state of affairs.
This will be a very genuine campaign, it will be a clarification of the proletarian line.

Minutes).
Printed from the text of the book 2 NEWSPAPER REPORT The invitation to attend the conference is addressed to all the socialist parties of Russia and consequently to our own as well, and so we cannot simply ignore this fact of international importance.
The social-chauvinists of all the belligerent countries are acting as unofficial representa-tives of their governments and ruling classes, Comrade Lenin said.
The German Government, under the pressure of internal discontent, is prepared to give up some of its annexations, and Borgbjerg is its diplomatic representative.
He (a repre-sentative of Stauning’s party, from which a group of Marxists, headed by Comrade Trier, withdrew followingStauning’s entry into the bourgeois ministry) has nothing in common either with the German or the Scandinavian workers.
A conference of social-patriotic majorities appears to the German ruling circles to be a convenient occasion for trying to come to terms with the brigands on the other side.
The social-patriots, who have taken part in this ignomin-ious war, as Comrade Nogin put it, want to have a hand in its ignominious end as well.
On the other hand, the rebuff administered to this proposal by the imperialists of the Triple Entente lays quite bare their schemes of conquest.
That is what revolutionary Social-Democracy must use in its own interests, by exposing the fraud on both sides.
The Party, which unites more than 70,000 workers, must issue a warning against this fraud to the internationalist workers of all countries.

Printed from a typewritten copy of the minutes3 SPEECH ON THE ATTITUDE TO THE SOVIETS OF WORKERS’ AND SOLDIERS’ DEPUTIES APRIL 25 (MAY 8) 1 MINUTES The materials submitted by comrades on the activity of the Soviets, while being incomplete, are remarkably inter-esting.
This may be the most important information mate-rial produced by the conference, material which makes it possible to verify our slogans against the actual course of life.
The picture we now have disposes us to optimistic conclusions.
The movement started out in the centres; initially all the energy of the proletariat there was concen-trated on the struggle.
A mass of energy was spent on the struggle against tsarism.
This struggle in Petrograd has eliminated the central state power.
A gigantic task has been done.
But if that has led to the seizure of power by the bourgeoi-sie it does not warrant any pessimistic conclusions, it is not right to regard the workers’ failure to take power as a mistake.
It would be utopian to suppose that after a few days of struggle the masses could have taken power into their hands.
That could not have been done in the presence of the bourgeoisie, which was very well prepared for taking over.
From the centre, the revolution is moving into the local-ities.
That is what happened in France — the revolution is becoming a municipal one.
The movement in the localities shows that there the majority is for the peasants, for the workers, that there has been the least leadership from the bourgeoisie; that there the masses did not lose their head.
The more data we collect, the more they show us that the greater the proletarian section of the population and the fewer the intermediate elements, the better the revolution advances in the localities.
The Kazan comrades have gone over directly to the tasks of the socialist revolution.
We find that even where the proletariat’s organisations are insignifi-cant, the practical requirements have given the proletariat an absolutely correct definition of its tasks.
Without such elements as, for instance, statistics, etc.
, the proletarianrevolution cannot be carried out.
For the proletarian revolu-tion to be carried out, it is necessary that the engineers, technicians, etc.
, should be under the practical control of the revolutionary proletariat.
The revolution in the locali-ties has gone forward easily.
There is always the danger of anarchy in a revolution.
Over here anarchy is not.
.
.
.
* The bourgeois revolution is unmindful of production, but here the workers are giving it thought.
The workers are interested in seeing that production does not dwindle.
The revolution in the localities is going forward in gigantic strides.
Reports from the localities have shown that the sharper the class contradictions, the more correctly the revolution advances, the surer the dictatorship of the pro-letariat is realised.
While the dictatorship of the proletariat is being implemented in the small localities, the centres turn out to be the least suitable for the revolution’s advance.
There is absolutely no ground for any pessimism.
It is a fact that collaboration with the bourgeoisie is beginning in the centres.
Through its better organisation, the bourgeoi-sie is trying to turn the proletariat into a servitor, to make the workers temporary participants in what the bourgeoisie is building.
It is ridiculous to think that the Russian people are drawing their guiding principles from pamphlets.
Not at all, it is from the immediate practice that the experience of the masses flows.
.
.
.
* The people can work it out by partic-ipating in a mass movement.
The people themselves have started to accumulate mass experience.
.
.
.
* In Penza Gubernia, the power took shape under the dictatorship of the peasantry.
The Penza representative showed the resolutions of the peasants who had taken over the implements of production and land.
Marx’s words are being confirmed.
.
.
.
* The pro-gramme of the revolution is being carried out in the locali-ties — in order to have grain .
.
.
* to establish relations themselves.
This revolution produces men of practice.
The revolution can go forward only under the control of practical experience in the localities.
And we are very greatly encouraged by the course of the revolution through-out the whole of Russia, where the gigantic majority are peasants.
* Hiatus in the minutes.
—Ed.
After there proved to be insufficient strength to take over production in the centre, this is being done in the provinces, where it is easily done.
In the provinces, the revo-lution is a municipal one, and it is giving impetus to the centre; the latter is picking up their experience.
The comrade coal-miner said that their first task when.
.
.
* was to go for grain.
.
.
.
It is wrong to think that this experience can go to waste.
Without this experience, the centres have nowhere to get an impetus from for a fresh revolution.
The new revolution is mounting.
The course of events, the dislocation of life, the famine — that is what is propelling the revolution.
Hence the struggle against the elements supporting the bourgeoisie.
Things are moving towards a collapse which the bourgeoisie will not cope with.
We are preparing a new multimillion army which could show its mettle in the Soviets, in the Constituent Assembly — just how, we do not as yet know.
Over here in the centre we do not have enough strength.
There is a tremendous preponder-ance in the provinces.
On our side is the development of the revolution in the localities, which is going forward and overtaking us.
The people are not setting themselves any communist plans.
The revolutionary class throughout Russia is muster-ing its forces, and it is our task to accumulate this experience and take a step as these forces are mustered.
We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the fact that they (Narodniks, Mensheviks) are in such an overwhelming majority.
On the strength of the experience, we can now state in the resolution.
.
.
.
* In the localities, the production has to be taken over, otherwise the collapse is inevitable.
The peasants will not give the grain.
To obtain the grain, the measures must be revolutionary, which can be put through by the revolutionary class, relying on the masses in their millions.
I asked comrades from the localities about the state of production there.
The 8-hour day has been introduced in Nizhny Novgorod * Hiatus in the minutes.

Gubernia, and production has increased.
That is the earnest.
There is no other way of escaping the ruin.
It will take a vast amount of work.
We are separating ourselves from the petty-bourgeois line.
Life is on our side.
The crisis can-not be resolved by petty-bourgeois-democratic methods, because they stop short of revolutionary measures (Shinga-ryov, Milyukov).
The general course of the revolution shows that things are moving forward.
We do not differ from the petty bourgeoisie in that it says “caution”, and we say “speed”; we say “even more caution”.
There must be a relentless struggle against this state game.

Aprel 1 9 1 7 goda Printed from a typewritten copy of the minutes 2 NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin pointed out that the French revolution passed through a phase of municipal revolution, that it drew its strength from the local organs of self-government, which became its mainstay.
In the Russian revolution we observe a certain bureaucracy in the centres, and a greater exercise of power wielded by the Soviets locally, in the pro-vinces.
In the capital cities the Soviets are politically more dependent on the bourgeois central authorities than those in the provinces.
In the centres it is not so easy to take control of production, in the provinces this has already been carried out to some extent.
The inference is: to strengthen the local Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.
Progress in this respect is possible, coming primarily from the provinces.

Printed from the Pravda text4 SPEECH IN DEFENCE OF THE RESOLUTION ON THE WAR APRIL 27 (MAY 10) NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin, speaking in substantiation of the first resolution, pointed out the need for dividing the resolution into three parts: first, giving a class analysis of the war; second, dealing with so-called “revolutionary defencism”, and third, answering the question of how to end the war.
The first part of the resolution exposes the mainsprings of the imperialist war, establishes their connection with a definite period in the development of capitalism and brings out the annexationist strivings of the ruling classes of all countries.
The second part gives a characteristic of the peculiar trend.
The third part outlines the way to end the war — the way of revolutionary class struggle for power — refuting the absurd slander about a “separate” peace.

Lenin opposes the amendment: we are speaking about the majority, about the Menshevik Party as a whole, which is why the characteristic should not be changed.

P A R T Y P R O G R A M M E 540 At the end of the preamble (after the words “the stand-point of the proletariat”) insert: World capitalism has at the present time, i.
e.
, since about the beginning of the twentieth century, reached the stage of imperialism.
Imperialism, or the epoch of finance capital, is a high stage of development of the capitalist economic system, one in which monopolist associations of capitalists — syndicates, cartels and trusts — have assumed decisive importance: in which enormously concentrated banking capital has fused with industrial capital; in which the export of capital to foreign countries has assumed vast proportions: in which the whole world has been divided upterritorially among the richer countries, and the economic carve-up of the world among international trusts has begun.
Imperialist wars, i.
e.
, wars for world domination, for markets for banking capital and for the subjugation of small and weaker nations, are inevitable under such a state of affairs.
The first great imperialist war, the war of 1914-17, is precisely such a war.
The extremely high level of development which world capitalism in general has attained, the replacement of free competition by monopoly capitalism, the fact that the banks and the capitalist associations have prepared the machinery for the social regulation of the process of pro-duction and distribution of products, the horrors, misery, ruin, and brutalisation caused by the imperialist war — all these factors transform the present stage of capitalist development into an era of proletarian socialist revolution.
That era has dawned.
Only a proletarian socialist revolution can lead humanity out of the impasse which imperialism and imperialist wars have created.
Whatever difficulties the revolution may have to encounter, whatever possible temporary setbacks or waves of counter-revolution it may have to contend with, the final victory of the proletariat is inevitable.
Objective conditions make it the urgent task of the day to prepare the proletariat in every way for the revolution and resolutely break with the bourgeois perversion of social-ism, which has taken the upper hand in the official Social-Democratic parties in the form of a social-chauvinist trend (that is, socialism in words, chauvinism in fact, or the use of the “defend your country” slogan to cover up defence of capitalist interests in imperialist wars), and also in the form of a Centre trend (i.
e.
, unprincipled, helpless vacillation between social-chauvinism and revolu-tionary internationalist-proletarian struggle)* for the conquest of political power in order to carry out the econom-ic and political measures which are the sum and substance of the socialist revolution.
* * * * The text from “for the revolution.
.
.
” to “proletarian struggle)” is crossed out in the MS.
—Ed.
The fulfilment of this task, which calls for the fullest trust, the closest fraternal ties, and direct unity of revolu-tionary action on the part of the working class in all the advanced countries, is impossible without an immediate break in principle with the bourgeois perversion of socialism, which has gained the upper hand among the leadership of the great majority of the official Social-Democratic parties.
Such a perversion is, on the one hand, the social-chauvinist trend, socialism in word and chauvinism in deed, the defence of the predatory interests of “one’s own” national bourgeoisie under the guise of “defence of one’s country”; and, on the other hand, the equally wide international trend of the so-called Centre, which stands for unity with the social-chauvinists and for the preservation or correction of the bankrupt Second International, and which vacillates between social-chauvinism and the internationalist revolu-tionary struggle of the proletariat for the achievement of a socialist system.
* * * The experience of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1917, which created the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies and a number of similar organisations, thereby confirmed the experience of the Paris Commune, which consisted in the fact that the proletariat must have a state for the period of transition to socialism, but this state * must not be a con-ventional type of state, but the immediate, massive and wholesale organisation of the armed workers to substitute for the old instruments of administration: the standing army, the police and the civil service.

The end of the paragraph was left standing inadvertently; it was written on a separate sheet, at the bottom of which there is a note in an unknown hand: “Add: Apparatus for the regulation of production is ready in the form of trusts and concentration of banks” (see Lenin’s insertion in the “Proposed Amendments to the Doctrinal, Political and Other Sections of the Programme”, present edition, Vol.

must constitute one of the principal tasks of the proletarian party alongside its struggle against the representatives of the bankrupt Second (1889-1914) International, who have distorted Marxism and betrayed socialism on the dictator-ship of the proletariat question.
Monopoly capitalism, which has been developing into state-monopoly capitalism in a number of advanced countries with especial rapidity during the war, means gigantic social-isation of production and, consequently, complete prepara-tion of the objective conditions for the establishment of a socialist society.
* * * * In the minimum programme, the whole beginning (from the words “On the path” down to § 1) should be crossed out, and replaced by the following: In Russia at the present moment, when the Provisional Government, which is part and parcel of the landowner and capitalist class and enjoys the confidence — necessarily unstable — of the broad mass of the petty-bourgeois popula-tion, has undertaken to convene a Constituent Assembly, the immediate duty of the party of the proletariat is to fight for a political system which will best guarantee eco-nomic progress and the rights of the people in general, and make possible the least painful transition to socialism in particular.
The party is fighting and helping the masses to wage an immediate struggle for a democratic republic, starting the implementation of the freedoms by the masses’ organisation on their own, from below, and working for the establishment not of a bourgeois parliamentary republic, with its special guarantees both for the domination of the capitalists and for the possibility of using force against the masses through the retention of the old organs of mass oppression: the police, the standing army and the civil service, but of a more democratic proletarian-peasant republic in which the retention of these organs of oppression is impossible and inadmissible, and where the state power belongs directly to the workers and peasants who are armed to a man.

Supreme power in the state must be vested entirely in the people’s representatives, who shall be elected by the people and be subject to recall at any time, and who shall constitute a single popular assembly, a single chamber.

Add: Proportional representation at all elections; all delegates and elected officials, without exception, to be subject to recall at any time upon the decision of a majority of their electors.
§ 3.
Add: No supervision or control from above over the decisions and acts of regional and local self-governments.
§ 9 to read: The right of all member nations of the state to freely secede and form independent states.
The republic of the Russian nation must attract other nations or nationalities not by force, but exclusively by voluntary agreement on the question of forming a common state.
The unity and fraternal alliance of the workers of all countries are incom-patible with the use of force, direct or indirect, against other nationalities.
§11 to read: Judges and all other officials, both civil and military, to be elected by the people with the right to recall any of them at any time by decision of a majority of their electors.
Salaries to all officials to be not above the wages of a skilled worker, 300-500 rubles, depending on the number of family members and their earnings; unconditional prohibition for officials to supplement their salaries with income from other sources.
§12 to read: The police and standing army to be replaced by the universally armed people; workers and other employees to receive regular wages from the capitalists for the time devoted to public service in the people’s militia.

After the fiscal clause of the programme (following the words “on incomes and inheritances”) insert: The high level of development of capitalism already achieved in banking and in the trustified branches of indus-try, on the one hand, and the economic disruption caused by the imperialist war, everywhere evoking a demand for state and public control of the production and distribution of all staple products, on the other, induce the party to demand the nationalisation of the banks, syndicates (trusts), etc.
* * * The agrarian programme should be replaced by an agrarian resolution (see its text separately) * or rewritten in accord-ance with it.
** * * * The concluding part of the programme (the last two paragraphs from the words: “In the endeavour to achieve”) to be entirely deleted.

4 5 May 1 3 (April 3 0 ), 1 9 1 7 Printed from the Pravda text 8 REPORT ON THE AGRARIAN QUESTION APRIL 28 (MAY 11) NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin pointed to the landed estates, and the incredible jumble of arable fields brought about by the haphazard administration on the peasant land, first of thebailiffs, then of the 1861 magistrates and finally of the Stolypin officials, 541 as the principal cause of the enslaving feudal relations remaining in the countryside.
Hence, the natural desire on the part of the peasants to “clear the land”, to have all the land re-allotted, a desire which is expressed in the saying that “all the land is God’s”.
The peasant-holder cannot be reconciled with the obstacles which, in the new conditions of capitalist trade, he finds intolerable.
That is proved by the bill submitted by the 104 peasant deputies in the First and Second Dumas.
542 The Socialist-Revolutionaries have themselves admitted that in that Bill the “petty-economy ideology” prevails over the “principles of equalisation”.
The peasant wants to own his land, but wants it allotted in accordance with the new demands of the commodity economy.
Even where some peasants appear to accept the principle of egalitarian land tenure, their view of it is different from that of the S.
R.
intellectuals.
The statistical result of the distribution of the landowner and peasant holdings in Russia comes to the following figures: 300 peasant families hold 2,000 des-siatines, and one landowner holds as much.
Their demand for “equalisation” clearly contains the idea of equalising the rights of the 300 and the one.
The necessity of land nationalisation, as a fully bourgeois and highly progressive measure, has been prepared by the preceding development of the land economy in Russia and the development of the world market.
The war has sharpened every contradiction.
Just now, the immediate transfer of the land to the peasants is a demand powerfully dictated by the needs of wartime.
Shingaryov & Co.
actually intensify the crisis by inviting the peasants to wait for a Constituent Assembly (whereas the sowing must be done right away), thereby threatening to turn the grain shortage into a real famine.
They are trying to force on the peasants a bourgeois-bureaucratic solution of the agrarian question.
Meanwhile, there is no time to wait for the legalisation of landownership, because the crisis is approaching in gigantic strides.
The peasants have already displayed a revolutionary initiative — in Penza Gubernia they have been taking over the landowners’ live and dead stock for common use.
It goes without saying that ourParty stands only for the organised take-over of lands and implements because that is necessary for increasing produc-tion, while any damage to implements inflicts harm above all on the peasants and workers themselves.
On the other hand, we stand for the separate organi-sation of agricultural workers.

This amendment is not very essential.
I put nationali-sation in third place, because initiative and revolutionary action must come first, while nationalisation is a law ex-pressing the people’s will.

v aprele 1 9 1 7 goda Printed from a typewritten copy of the minutes 10 SPEECH ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION APRIL 29 (MAY 12) NEWSPAPER REPORT Comrade Lenin recalled that the Polish Social-Democrats were against the right to national self-determination in 1903, when the question was not raised in the prospect of a social-ist revolution.
The specific character of their stand on the national question is due to their peculiar position in Poland; the tsarist oppression fed the nationalistic passions of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois sections of Poland.
The Polish Social-Democrats had to go through a desperate struggle against the “socialists” (P.
P.
S) who were even prepared to have a European war for the sake of Poland’s liberation, and only they, the Polish Social-Democrats,spreading the feelings of international solidarity among the Polish workers, led them closer to the workers of Russia.
However, their attempt to impose a rejection of the right to self-determination on the socialists of the oppressor nations is extremely erroneous and in the event of success could result in nothing more than the adoption of a chauvinistic stand by the Russian Social-Democrats.
By rejecting the oppressed nations’ right to self-determination, the social-ists of the oppressor nations become chauvinists, giving support to their own bourgeoisie.
Russian socialists must work to secure freedom to secede for the oppressed nations, while the socialists of the oppressed nations must maintain freedom to integrate, both taking formally different (essen-tially the same) ways towards the same goal: the international organisation of the proletariat.
Those who say that the national question has been solved within the bourgeois system tend to forget that it has been solved (but not in every case) only in the west of Europe, where the purity of the population is sometimes as high as 90 per cent, but not in the east, where the purity of the population is limited to only 43 per cent.
Finland’s example shows that the national question is in practice on the order of the day and that the alternative is support for the imperialist bourgeoi-sie or the duty of international solidarity, which does not allow of any violation of the will of the oppressed nations.
The Mensheviks, who invited the Finnish Social-Democrats to “wait” until the Constituent Assembly and settle the question of autonomy together with it, actually spoke out in the spirit of the Russian imperialists.

My name is Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.
I was born in Simbirsk on April 10, 1870.
In the spring of 1887, my elder brother Alexander was executed by Alexan-der III for an attempt on his life (March 1, 1887).
In December 1887, I was arrested for the first time and expelled from Kazan University for students’ disturbances; I was then banished from Kazan.
In December 1895, I was arrested for the second time for Social-Democratic propaganda among the workers of St.
Petersburg.

S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) AT A MEETING OF THE PETROGRAD ORGANISATION MAY 8 (21), 1917 544 Comrade Lenin begins by saying that the conference met at an extraordinary time: there is now a revolution in Russia and an unprecedented war all over the world.
Consequently, if we are to understand the decisions of our conference we must first of all understand the kind of war we are waging and who began it, what kind of revolution we have carried out and the kind of revolution that lies ahead of us.
The war was not started by the workers and peasants: neither the Russian, the German, the French, the Italian, the Belgian, nor the British workers and peasants started this war.
The war was started and is being continued by the capitalists of the world: the British capitalists and their friends, the French, the Russian and the Italian capitalists, against the German capitalists and their friends, the Austrian capitalists.
What is this war being fought for? Is it being fought for the emancipation or for the inter-ests of the workers and peasants? No, it is not.
The purpose of the war is plunder and a division of foreign lands — that is what makes the capitalists shout about the war to a victorious end.
Tsar Nicholas, as big a brigand as Wilhelm, concluded secret predatory treaties with the British and French capi-talists; these treaties are not being published as otherwise the whole people would realise the fraud, and the war would quickly be over.
That is why our resolution on the war flatly calls this war a predatory imperialist war.
How, then, can an end be put to this world-wide slaugh-ter? Can it be ended by someone pulling out of it? No, it cannot.
It cannot because the war is being fought not by two states but by many, and because the capitalists can end the war only for a time in order to prepare for a new one.
That is the kind of peace no worker or peasant wants,whoever he may be, a German, a Frenchman or a Russian.
Who, then, can end the war? The war can be ended only by the workers and peasants, not of Russia alone, but of the whole world.
The workers and peasants of the world have the same interests: struggle against the capitalists and the landowners.
That is why, only by uniting, the workers and peasants of the world can put an end to this war.
That is why we Bolsheviks are against a separate peace, i.
e.
, against a peace only be-tween Russia and Germany.
A separate peace is a stupidity, because it fails to settle the basic issue, the struggle against the capitalists and the landowners.
How, then, are the workers and peasants of the whole world to unite? The war is in their way.
The Russian revolution has toppled the autocracy and has given the Russian people unprecedented freedom, which is unmatched among any people of the world.
But has it settled the basic question of Russian life, the question of land? No, because the land is still in the hands of the land-owners.
Why is that so? Because the people who overthrew the tsar handed over power not only into the hands of their elected representatives — peasants and workers, the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, but also into the hands of the Provisional Government.
The Provisional Government, let us note, consists of capitalists, landowners and those who sincerely or hypo-critically say that Russia can be saved only hand in hand with the landowners.
But the landowners refuse to give land to the peasants, the capitalists refuse to give up their profits from the war and the plunder of foreign lands.
That is why we Bolsheviks do not support the Provision-al Government, and do not advise socialists to take ministerial office.
Socialist ministers can do no more than lend their names to cover up plunder and conquest.
And they are already doing so.
They have entered the government and have joined the capitalists in saying: this war is not only a defen-sive, but also an offensive one, and the peasants will not get their land now, but after the convocation of the Con-stituent Assembly.
That is why we are against the Provisional Government and recognise only our own government: the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
There is no better government, the people have not yet created one, and you can’t invent one.
Why, in that case, has this government of ours decided to give support to the Provisional Government consisting of capitalists, landowners and socialists, who do not want to give land to the people now and preach an offensive? Because we now have in the Soviets of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies a majority of peasant-soldiers who do not understand what each of the parties wants in practice.
Hence, our task is patiently to explain to the workers and peasants that everything — the end of the war, land for the peasants, and real struggle against the capitalists, not in words, but in deeds — will be secured only when the whole people comes to realise not from books, but from its own experience that only full power for the workers and peasants, only the power of the Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Deputies can help to start a resolute struggle for peace, for land and for socialism.
You cannot disregard the people.
Only dreamers and plotters believed that a minority could impose their will on a majority.
That was what the French revolutionary Blanqui thought, and he was wrong.
When the majority of the people refuse, because they do not yet understand, to take power into their own hands, the minority, however revolutionary and clever, cannot impose their desire on the majority of the people.
From this flow our actions.
We Bolsheviks must patiently and perseveringly explain our views to the workers and peasants.
Each of us must forget our old view of our work, each, without waiting for the arrival of an agitator, a propagandist, a more knowledgea-ble comrade who will explain everything — each of us must become all in one: agitator, propagandist and Party organiser.
That is the only way we can get the people to understand our doctrine, to think over their experience and really take power into their own hands.

Among them were the Menshevik leader Martov, the Socialist-Revolutionary leader Natanson and others.
This transit has provided fresh evidence that there is no other reliable way from Switzerland, except via Germany.
Izvestia Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh Deputatov (No.

The speaker goes on to the question of how the European war can be eliminated.
It then turns out that he does not see the settlement of the European crisis in such optimistic colours as A.
Lunacharsky.
547 He says that the “without annexations” formula does not at all mean any desire to return Europe to the “status quo ante”.
We believe that “without annexations” also means without the seizures carried out before the war.
We take this formula to mean giving the peoples complete freedom to secede from one state and join another.
But it is impossible to implement this formula without a socialist revolution, which is why there is no way out of the European war except a world-wide revolution.
Referring to fraternisation, Lenin says: the spontaneous fraternisation will not settle the question of peace, but we regard it as the cornerstone of our revolutionary work.
Fraternisation does not in itself solve the question, but then no other measure alone decides the revolution until it leads to one.
What is a strike or a demonstration? They are after all only a link in the entire chain of the revolu-tionary struggle.
We are being told that this fraterni-sation has worsened the situation on the other fronts.
That is not true.
It has created a virtual armistice on our front and has caused small changes on the Western front.
But in whose favour? In favour of Britain and France.
On the other hand, Britain has scored a great success in Asia: she has gobbled up Baghdad.
The suspension of the fighting on our front has been brought about by revolutionary fraternisation, against which Kerensky is waging a war, and against which an offensive signed by the Mensheviks has been announced.
We must make fraternisation conscious, we must see that it is transformed into an exchange of ideas, that it is carried over to the other fronts, that it kindles a revo-lution on the other side of the trenches.
On the question of regulating industry, the speaker says: since February 28, the government has done nothing to cut down the industrialists’ profits.
The other day we read about the establishment of a commission consisting of several ministers led by Skobelev to work out control meas-ures.
But we had commissions under the tsar, they are nothing but a swindle.
The speaker says there is need immediately to take over the landed estates, and ends his speech by stating that the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies must either take all the power or die an inglo-rious death.
Notes are being passed to the speaker from every side.
Within a short time they number 20.
The first of them asks whether the draft reinforcements should be sent to the front.
Replying to the question, Lenin says: under the tsarist power we had to go into the army and work there.
Lieb-knecht put on a uniform to conduct agitation against the war.
It is naive to think that the war can be abolished by sepa-rate anarchic action.

While denying the right of the big nations to enslave the small nationalities, socialism has never recommended the opposite course of action: enslavement of the big nations by the small nationalities.
But it is precisely to this kind of violence against the will of the all-Russia democracy, to a denial of joint revolutionary democratic work, a substitution of national hostility for the class struggle, that the programme, or at any rate the tactics, of the Ukrainian Rada boils down.

” There you see where the swings of the Novaya Zhizn petty-bourgeois chatterboxes are taking them — straight to the Black-Hundred reaction! It is after all only the Men-shikovs yesterday and the Katkovs the day before yesterday who could say that the Ukrainians’ desire to have their own sejm, their own ministers, their own army, their own finances and other things was “enslavement” of the Rus-sian people!

L.
P.
(B.
) JUNE 20 (JULY 3), 1917 550 BRIEF NEWSPAPER REPORT At the morning sitting, Lenin gave a report on the current situation.
He noted the difference between the situation today and that during the Party’s April Conference.
At that time, the stand of the various socialist parties had still hardly crystallised.
Only now, in the present conditions, and in the light of the events that have just taken place, has the real political face of the Mensheviks and the S.
R.
s been revealed.
But the petty bourgeoisie, without beingsocialist, may turn out to be really democratically minded.
Viewing the S.
R.
and Menshevik masses from that stand-point, we must give them credit for consistent democratism.
But that cannot be said of their leaders, which is why we find that there is a yawning gulf between the S.
R.
and the Menshevik masses, on the one hand, and their leaders, on the other.
The leaders of these masses have been gradually shedding not only their socialism, but their democratism as well.
This will be seen in the attitude of the socialist ministers to the three vital issues of the moment.
On the question of land, the socialist section of the government has clearly diverged from the views of the peasantry, and is helping the landowners to keep their lands at their disposal.
The second touchstone of the social-ist ministers’ democratism is their attitude to local self-government.
It is an elementary democratic proposition that the local power must be elected by the people them-selves, but on this point there have been numerous conflicts between the Provisional Government and the local organs of self-government, and the socialist section of the ministry has been an active fighter against these truly democratic principles.
Finally, the third question is the offensive.
The socialist Kerensky has managed to secure what the patent imperialist Guchkov had been unable to do.
We revolutionary Social-Democrats must direct our activity towards raising the class consciousness of the democratic masses.
That is why we must relentlessly expose these former leaders of petty-bourgeois democracy, pointing out to democracy the only way along which the revolution-ary proletariat will march ahead of it.
Novaya Zhizn No.
5 4 , June 2 1 (July 4 ), 1 9 1 7 Printed from the Novaya Zhizn text THE POLITICAL SITUATION 551 (FOUR THESES) 1.
The counter-revolution has become organised and con-solidated, and has actually taken state power into its hands.
552 The complete organisation and consolidation of the counter-revolution consists in a combination of its threemain forces, a combination excellently conceived and already put into practice: (1) The Constitutional-Democratic Party, i.
e.
, the real leader of the organised bourgeoisie, has, by withdrawing from the Cabinet, confronted it with an ultimatum, thus clearing the way for the Cabinet’s overthrow by the counter-revolution; (2) The General Staff and the military leaders, with the deliberate or semi-deliberate assistance of Kerensky, whom even the most prominent Socialist-Revolutionaries now call a Cavaignac, have seized actual state power and have proceeded to shoot down revo-lutionary units at the front, disarm the revolutionary troops and workers in Petrograd and Moscow, suppress unrest in Nizhny Novgorod, arrest Bolsheviks and ban their papers, not only without trial, but even without a govern-ment order.
At present, basic state power in Russia is virtually a military dictatorship.
This fact is still obscured by a number of institutions that are revolutionary in words but powerless in deeds.
Yet it is so obvious and fundamental a fact that, without understanding it, one can-not understand anything about the political situation.
(3) The Black-Hundred-monarchist and bourgeois press, which has switched from hounding Bolsheviks to hounding the Soviets, the “incendiary” Chernov, etc.
, has indicated with the utmost clarity that the true meaning of the policy of military dictatorship, which now reigns supreme and is supported by the Cadets and monarchists, is preparation for disbanding the Soviets.
Many of the leaders of the S.
R.
s and Mensheviks, i.
e.
, the present majority in the Soviets, have admitted and expressed this during the past few days, but true to their petty-bourgeois nature, they shrug off this formidable reality with meaningless high-sounding phrases.
2.
The leaders of the Soviets and of the Socialist-Revolu-tionary and Menshevik parties, headed by Tsereteli and Chernov, have completely betrayed the cause of the revolution by putting it in the hands of the counter-revolutionaries and by turning themselves, their parties and the Soviets into mere fig-leaves of the counter-revolution.
Proof of this is that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks have betrayed the Bolsheviks and have tacitly agreed to close down their papers without daring to tellthe people plainly and openly that they are doing so and why.
By sanctioning the disarming of the workers and the revolutionary regiments, they have deprived themselves of all real power.
They have turned into the most loud-mouthed ranters who help the reaction to “divert” the people’s attention until it is finally ready to disband the Soviets.
It is impossible to understand anything at all about the present political situation without realising this complete and final bankruptcy of the S.
R.
s and Mensheviks and the present majority in the Soviets and without realising that their “Directory” and other masquerades are an absolute sham.
3.
All hopes for a peaceful development of the Russian revolution have vanished for good.
This is the objective situation: either complete victory for the military dictator-ship, or victory for the workers’ armed uprising; the latter victory is only possible when it coincides with a deep mass upheaval against the government and the bourgeoisie caused by economic disruption and the prolongation of the war.
The slogan “All Power to the Soviets!” was a slogan for peaceful development of the revolution which was possible in April, May, June, and up to July 5-9, i.
e.
, up to the time when actual power passed into the hands of the mili-tary dictatorship.
This slogan is no longer correct, for it does not take into account that power has changed hands and that the revolution has in fact been completely betrayed by the S.
R.
s and Mensheviks.
Reckless actions, revolts, partial resistance, or hopeless hit-and-run attempts to oppose reaction will not help.
What will help is a clear understanding of the situation, endurance and determina-tion of the workers’ vanguard, preparation of forces for the armed uprising, for the victory of which conditions at present are extremely difficult, but still possible if the facts and trends mentioned in the thesis coincide.
Let us have no constitutional or republican illusions of any kind, no more illusions about a peaceful path, no sporadic actions, no yielding n o w to provocation from the Black Hundreds and Cossacks.
Let us muster our forces, reorganise them and resolutely prepare for the armed uprising, if the course of the crisis permits it on a really mass, country-wide scale.
The transfer of land to the peasants is impossible at pres-ent without an armed uprising, since the counter-revolution-aries, having taken power, have completely united with the landowners as a class.
The aim of the insurrection can only be to transfer power to the proletariat, supported by the poor peasants, with a view to putting our Party programme into effect.
4.
The party of the working class, without abandoning legal activity but never for a moment overrating it, must c o m b i n e legal with illegal work, as it did in 1912-14.
Don’t let a single hour of legal work slip by.
But don’t cherish any constitutional or “peaceful” illusions.
Form illegal organisations or cells everywhere and at once for the publication of leaflets, etc.
Reorganise immediately, consistently, resolutely, all along the line.
Act as we did in 1912-14, when we could speak about overthrowing tsarism by a revolution and an armed upris-ing, without at the same time losing our legal base in the Duma, the insurance societies, the trade unions, etc.

6 Signed: W.
Printed from the original LETTER OVER THE PUBLICATION OF “LEAFLET ON THE CAPTURE OF RIGA” 553 This leaflet cannot, of course, be published legally, but everything must be done to have it published illegally.
It would be extremely stupid of us to jeopardise our legal newspapers (which are so terribly important for us, and which it has taken such a great effort to keep going) and fail to do what we had managed to do in 1912-14: to use our legal possibilities.
We should neither print the article (leaflet) legally nor spoil it by rewriting it for legal publi-cation.
It would be not only stupid but base on our part to confine ourselves to the legal word, when its freedom has so drastically been curtailed by the government and is being further curtailed from day to day.
I am aware that the sluggishness of our Bolsheviks isgreat and that it will take a great deal of effort to secure the publication of illegal leaflets.
But I shall go on insist-ing because those are the demands of life, the demands of the movement.
We must issue illegally free leaflets and handbills which are not curtailed and which speak out at the top of their voice.
They should be signed: “A group of persecuted Bolshe-viks”.
We can confine ourselves to that signature or add below in small type: “The group of persecuted Bolsheviks consists of those Bolsheviks whom the government’s perse-cution has forced to work illegally.
” Or: “The group of persecuted Bolsheviks consists of Bolsheviks whom the government’s persecution and withdrawal of press freedom have forced to publish free leaflets illegally, and to act outside the framework of the legal Bolshevik Party.
” LEAFLET ON THE CAPTURE OF RIGA Workers, soldiers and all working people! The enemy troops have taken Riga.
We have suffered another heavy defeat.
The incredible calamities inflicted on the people by the war are being aggravated and dragged out.
Why is the war being dragged out? The reason is still a division of the spoils between the capitalist brigands, the point at issue is still whether the German capitalist predators will retain Belgium, Serbia, Poland, Riga, etc.
, whether the British capitalist predators will retain Baghdad and the German colonies they have seized, whether the Russian capitalist predators will retain Armenia, etc.
The Kerensky government, with the participation and support of the Mensheviks and the S.
R.
s, has been brazenly cheating the people, lulling them with empty talk about their desire for peace, talk which is not binding in any way, while actually dragging out the predatory war, and refusing to publish the secret treaties which the tsar con-cluded with the British and French capitalists for the enrichment of the Russian capitalists who had been promised Constantinople, Galicia and Armenia.
Even under the Republic, the Russian people are shedding their blood for the fulfilment of the secret treaties, the predatory treaties between the capitalists.
For months, the “republicans”, Kerensky, Skobelev, Chernov & Co.
, have been cheating the Russian workers and peasants, instead of abrogating the secret predatory treaties, instead of offering precise, clear-cut and fair peace terms to all the belligerent nations.
Kerensky together with the Mensheviks and the S.
R.
s has cheated the people.
Only a workers’ government can save the country, and safeguard it from the losses of the war and the plunder of the capital-ist marauders.
In connection with the Riga defeat, the bourgeoisie is already anticipating the introduction of new harsh laws and strict disciplinary measures against soldiers, workers and peasants.
Already the peasants are being deprived of their grain, while, through the blocking of workers’ control, the capitalists are allowed to retain their outrageous-ly high profits and to safeguard their sacrosanct “commercial secrets”, which shield the bankers and millionaires from exposure.
Meanwhile, the Mensheviks and the S.
R.
s, disgracefully crawling to the bourgeoisie, continue to give it their support and shout about the need to “leave off” “all party strife”, which means leaving full power in the hands of the capitalists, and the country’s continued plunder by them, and leaving them the “freedom” to protract the war.
.
.
.
Tens and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the offen-sive, which the Kerensky, Menshevik, and S.
R.
government started in June.
Tens and hundreds of thousands will die in the protracted war, so long as the people continue to tolerate such a government.
Only a workers’ government can save the country.
It alone will not cheat the people, but will immediately offer to all countries precise, clear-cut and fair peace terms.
The bourgeoisie has been trying to intimidate the people and create a panic, in an effort to get the ignorant people to believe that peace cannot be offered right away, as this would mean “losing Riga” and so on.
That is cheating the people.
Even if peace were to be negotiated by the governments, i.
e.
, the governments safeguarding the sacred rights of the capitalists to their plundered wealth and seizures of foreign lands (annexations), even then the offer of peace would not mean abandonment of Riga.
Riga is the booty of the German capitalist brigands.
Armenia is the booty of the Russian capitalist brigands.
When brigands negotiate on peace they either each keep their own booty or swap pieces of it.
That is how all wars have ended and will end, so long as power re-mains in the hands of the capitalists.
But we speak of a workers ’ government which alone can offer just peace terms right away, and this has been stated hundreds of times by workers and peasants throughout Russia in their countless man-dates and resolutions.
These terms are: peace without annexations, i.
e.
, without the seizure of foreign lands.
This means: neither the Germans nor the Russians will be able forcibly, without the volun-tary consent of the Poles, to integrate Poland or the Latvian Territory; neither the Turks nor the Russians will be able to seize Armenia, and so on.
These just peace terms will at once be offered by a workers’ govern-ment to all the belligerent countries without exception.
Until this has been done, until precise, clear-cut, formal proposals of peace have been made, until there has been an overthrow of the total power of the marauding capitalists, who are making hundreds of millions on war contracts, and so long as the secret predatory treaties remain intact— all talk of peace comes to nothing but gross and utterly shameless deception of the people.
All the capitalist governments, including the Kerensky, S.
R.
and Menshevik government, have been practising this deceptionof the people.
They have all been mouthing phrases of peace, which are not binding in any way, no one has been offering any precise peace terms, no one has abrogated the secret treaties, and in fact everyone has continued to drag out the criminal predatory war over the capi-talists’ profits, which is ruining the peoples.
Down with the war! Down with the Kerensky, Menshevik and S.
R.
government, which is cheating the people, protracting the war, safeguarding the predatory interests of the capitalists, putting off the elections to the Constituent Assembly! Only a workers’ government supported by the poor peasants will offer peace, putting an end to the capitalist plunder, and give the working people bread and freedom.
Let every worker and soldier explain to the people the need to overthrow the Kerensky government and set up a workers’ government.

PETERSBURG ORGANISATION, AND ALSO FOR A RESOLUTION AND INSTRUCTIONS TO THOSE ELECTED TO THE PARTY CONGRESS 554 ON THE LIST OF CANDIDATES F O R T H E C O N S T I T U E N T A S S E M B L Y 555 The list of candidates published by the Central Com-mittee has been compiled in an inadmissible manner and calls for the sharpest protest.
The point is that there must be four or five times more workers in a peasant Constitu-ent Assembly, because they alone are capable of establishing close and intimate ties with the peasant deputies.
It is absolutely inadmissible also to have an excessive number of candidates from among people who have but recently joined our Party and have not yet been tested (like Larin).
In filling the list with such candidates who should first have worked in the Party for months and months, the C.
C.
has thrown wide open the door for careerists who scramble for seats in the Constituent Assembly.
There is need for an urgent review and correction of the list.
NOTE TO THESIS “ON THE LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY” It goes without saying that from among the mezhraion-tsi 556 who have been hardly tested in proletarian work in our Party’s spirit, no one would contest the candidature of, say, Trotsky, for, first, upon his arrival, Trotsky at once took up an internationalist stand; second, he worked among the mezhraiontsi for a merger; third, in the difficult July days he proved himself equal to the task and a loyal supporter of the party of the revolutionary proletariat.
Clearly, as much cannot be said about many of the new Party members entered on the list.
Larin’s nomination is especially scandalous (apart from his being placed ahead of Petrovsky, Krylenko and others.
.
.
).
During the war, Larin helped the chauvinists, spoke on their behalf at the Swedish congress, and helped to print lies against the St.
Petersburg workers and their boycott of the War Industries Committees.
During the war, before the revo-lution, Larin did not once show himself to be a fighter for internationalism.
Upon his return to Russia, Larin long helped the Mensheviks and even came out in the press with indecent attacks against our Party, in the Alexinsky spirit.
Larin is well known for his “swings”: let us recall his pamphlet on the labour congress and on a merger with the S.
R.
s.
Of course, there would be no need to recall all this, if Larin entered the Party with a desire to reform.
But to get him into the Constituent Assembly within a week or so of his entry into the Party is in fact to transform the Party into the same kind of dirty stall for careerists as most of the European parties are.
* The serious work in the Constituent Assembly will consist in establishing close, intimate ties with the peasants.
Only workers who are in touch with peasant life are fit for this.
To pack the Constituent Assembly with orators and * What about M.

writers is to take the beaten track of opportunism and chauvinism.
That is unworthy of the “Third Interna-tional”.
Written between September 2 9 and October 4 (October 2 and 17 ), 1 9 1 7 First published in full in 1 9 6 2 in Vol.
3 4 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works Printed from a typewritten copy “THE LANDOWNERS HAVE HIT IT OFF WITH THE CADETS” That is not our expression.
It was used by the newspaper Dyelo Naroda 557 No.
170 of October 3, quoting the words of “a provincial worker” who described what had happened in Russia in the summer and autumn of 1917.
Dyelo Naroda is known to be the chief official organ of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.
Former Minister Chernov is on its Editorial Board.
The admission of such a paper is especially valuable.
Here it is: “The landowners have hit it off with the Cadets, according to a provincial worker.
In plainer language, this means that the landown-ers have found sympathy and support among some elements of the government in the centre and in the localities, that they have recov-ered from the first shock and have started to organise.
.
.
.
Attacks on the land committees have started and have been growing from day to day, first in the form of a cornucopia of complaints and wails about ‘robberies’, ‘arbitrary acts’, and ‘pogroms’.
.
.
.
The complaints were followed by restrictive circulars from above and judicial prosecution of the land committees, and in the localities close to the front, also by interference from the military authorities in the form of orders issued by General Kornilov.
Even here, in Petrograd, the Ministry of Justice has also threatened to institute criminal proceedings against the Chief Land Committee.
“The cancellation of pre-revolutionary leasehold contracts is the most frequent pretext for the commission for trial and the filing of civil suits.
The landowners and all those who are with them have been saying in one voice: the law on contracts has not been rescinded, which means that all the contracts are still valid, and ‘no committees or private persons’ have the right to cancel them.
.
.
.
So the ‘unwary’ committees are being massively struck down by the old justice for cancelling the contracts and reducing the leasehold prices.
The fact is, however, that such reductions are absolutely inevitable and hardly any contract has remained intact anywhere.
”(The paper goes on to give the evidence of a “most moder-ate Professor Kablukov” who says that the short-term peasant tenant is sometimes “worse off than the serf.
.
.
.
”) “In these circumstances, cancellation of the shackling leasehold contracts, concluded before the revolution, far from being a crime, was a direct duty of the organs of power.
.
.
.
The effort to keep a section of the peasant tenants ‘worse off than the serfs’ at any price was a downright provocation to riot, a provocation which was the more criminal in that it was carried out exclusively in the interests of the class of feudal-minded landowners, and at a time when the republic and the whole people are suffering the greatest calamities.
.
.
.
It is no accident, after all, that pogroms have broken out and the ‘nests’ of the gentry are in flames precisely in Tambov Gubernia, where the number of committees put on trial is great.
.
.
.
” That is what is said in the newspaper Dyelo Naroda, the official organ of the ministerial party of S.
R.
s.
These lines should be reprinted everywhere, issued as leaflets, and circulated in millions of copies among the peasants, because they contain proof, given by the S.
R.
s (Socialist-Revolutionaries) themselves and quoted by V.
Chernov’s own paper, proof that the S.
R.
s have betrayed the peasants to the landowners, that the S.
R.
Party has betrayed the peasantry, and that if it has not also “hit it off” with the landowners, it has at any rate surrendered to them.
The people must be given the chance to read and reread these lines.
Every class-conscious peasant, soldier and worker must give thought to the meaning of these admis-sions.
Seven months of the revolution have passed.
Countless times the people have expressed their confidence in the S.
R.
s, have given them majorities at elections, and said to the S.
R.
Party: lead on, we entrust you with the lead-ership! Since March 1917, the S.

Party in the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies has been operating in a bloc (alliance) with the Mensheviks, and has had a majority for months and months! Since May 6, mem-bers of the Party of S.
R.
s and Mensheviks have been and still are ministers and deputy ministers together with the “despicable Cadets”, alongside the “despicable Cadets”, in alliance with the “despicable Cadets”!!Dyelo Naroda has itself admitted the results of this coalition (alliance, agreement) with the despicable Cadets and the landowners.
Seven months of the revolution, seven months of the democratic republic, seven months of S.
R.
and Menshevik domination in the Soviets have resulted in a “vast” number of members of the land committees put on trial— trial under the old justice, by the old courts, by the tsarist-landowner courts; they have resulted in peasant revolts in Tambov and other gubernias! That is the result of the peasants’ trusting the S.

M.
SVERDLOV To Comrade Sverdlov.
I learnt only last night that Zinoviev had issued a writ-ten denial of his participation in Kamenev’s statement in Novaya Zhizn.
Why then have you not sent me anything??? I sent all the letters about Kamenev and Zinoviev to C.
C.
members only.
— You know this; is it not strange then that you seem to doubt it? It looks as if I will not be able to attend the Plenary Meeting, because “they are looking for me”.
If you (& Stalin, Sokolnikov and Dzerzhinsky) demand a compromise on the Zinoviev and Kamenev affair, 558 enter a proposal against me, to have the case referred to a Party court (the facts are clear that Zinoviev was also thwarting it deliberately); this will be a postponement.

“Kamenev’s resignation has been accepted”? From the C.

Cancellation of the Cossacks’ demonstration is a great victory.

Academy of Science Publishers Printed from the originalNOTES1 The League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class was organised by Lenin in the autumn of 1895.
It united about twenty Marxist workers’ circles in St.
Petersburg.
The work of the League was based on the principles of centralism and strict dis-cipline.
It was headed by a Central Group, which included V.
I.
Lenin, A.
A.
Vaneyev, P.
K.
Zaporozhets, G.
M.
Krzhizha-novsky, N.
K.
Krupskaya, L.
Martov (Y.
O.
Tsederbaum), M.
A.
Silvin, and V.
V.
Starkov.
Immediate guidance on every aspect of the work came from five members of this group led by Lenin.
The organisation was subdivided into district groups con-nected with factories and plants through forward-looking, class-conscious workers (like I.
V.
Babushkin and V.
A.
Shelgunov).
At the plants there were organisers for the collection of informa-tion and distribution of literature, and workers’ circles were set up at the major enterprises.
The League was the first in Russia to bring together socialism and the working-class movement, going forward from the propa-ganda of Marxism among a small number of leading workers in circles to political agitation among broad masses of the prole-tariat.
It guided the working-class movement, tying in the workers’ struggle for economic demands with the political struggle against tsarism.
The influence of the League spread well beyond St.
Peters-burg.
On its initiative, the workers’ circles in Moscow, Kiev Yekaterinoslav and other cities and regions of Russia united into similar leagues.
In December 1895, the tsarist government dealt the League a heavy blow: on the night of the 8th (20th), many of its leaders, including Lenin, were arrested.
In response to the arrest, a leaflet was issued, formulating political demands and proclaiming the existence of the League.
While in prison, Lenin continued to direct the League’s activi-ties, sending out coded letters and leaflets, and wrote a pamphlet On Strikes (which is yet to be discovered) and “Draft and Expla-nation of the Social-Democratic Party Programme” (see present edition, Vol.
2, pp.
93-121).
The importance of the League lay in the fact that, as Lenin said, it was the first important embryo of a revolutionary party relying on the working-class movement and directing the prole-tariats ’ class struggle.
“Communication on behalf of the ‘Stariki’ to the Members of the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Work-ing Class” was written by Lenin in prison in 1896 as a warningto the League members at liberty against the provocateur N.
Mikhailov.
It was written between the lines of page 240 of N.
I.
Tezyakov’s book, Agricultural Workers and the Organisation of Sanitary Supervision over Them in Kherson Gubernia (1896), which Lenin was reading for his work The Development of Capi-talism in Russia.
Apparently for reasons of secrecy, the manuscript contains a great number of abbreviations and is written in a very fine hand with a plain lead pencil poorly visible in places, which is why some of it has not been deciphered.
p.
33 2The student organisation bearing the name of “corporation” was set up in St.
Petersburg University at the end of 1891 from students’ self-education circles.
It united revolutionary-minded young people, but had no specified political programme and broke up within a few months.
Its members were betrayed to the police by N.
Mikhailov, who was one of its organisers but was connected with the secret police.
p.
33 3The Strike at the Voronin factory (a cotton-weaving manufactory owned by the merchant I.
A.
Voronin) was staged at the end of January 1894 and was caused by a cut in rates which led to a drop in wages.
It continued for three days and ended in a victory for the workers: the rates were increased.
Several workers, accused of being instigators, were arrested and deported from St.
Peters-burg.
p.
33 4Narodovoltsi—members of the Narodnaya Volya (the People’s Will), a secret political organisation of Narodnik terrorists which arose in August 1879 as a result of the split within the Narodnik organisation known as Zemlya i Volya (Land and Freedom).
The Narodnaya Volya was headed by an Executive Committee consist-ing, among others, of A.
I.
Zhelyabov, A.
D.
Mikhailov, M.
F.
Frolenko, N.
A.
Morozov, V.
N.
Figner, S.
L.
Perovskaya and A.
A.
Kvyatkovsky.
The Narodovoltsi, remaining utopian socialists, took the path of political struggle, and regarded as their main task the overthrow of the autocracy and the gaining of polit-ical freedom.
Their programme provided for the organisation of a “permanent people’s representation” elected on the basis of universal suffrage, proclamation of democratic freedoms, transfer of the land to the people and the working out of measures for the transfer of factories and plants to the workers.
Lenin wrote: “The Narodnaya Volya members made a step forward when they took up the political struggle, but they failed to connect it with social-ism” (present edition, Vol.
8, p.
72).
The Narodovoltsi waged a heroic struggle against the tsarist autocracy.
But proceeding from their erroneous theory of active “heroes” and the passive “crowd”, they expected to achieve the reconstruction of society without the people’s participation, through their own efforts, and by individual acts of terrorism to intimidate and disorganise the government.
Following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II on March 1, 1881, the government crushed theNarodnaya Volya by provocations, fierce reprisals and executions.
Lenin, while criticising the erroneous and utopian programme of the Narodovoltsi, spoke with great respect about their selfless struggle against tsarism and put a high value on their conspira-torial techniques and strictly centralised organisation.

34 5The draft agreement with P.
B.
Struve was worked out as a result of the talks held by V.
I.
Lenin, V.
I.
Zasulich and A.
N.
Potresov with Struve, which had been started on Potresov’s initiative on December 29, 1900 (see present edition, Vol.
4, pp.
380-82).
The “legal Marxists” (mentioned in the document as the Svoboda [Freedom] democratic opposition group) Struve and M.
I.
Tugan-Baranovsky wanted the establishment of an illegal organ abroad (suggesting the name of Sovremennoye Obozreniye [Contemporary Review]) to be published parallel with Iskra and Zarya, but not openly connected with the Social-Democrats.
The Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya agreed to participate in the publication, hoping to obtain political material and reports for Iskra through Struve, but stipulated that the new organ should appear not more often than Zarya and as a supplement to it.
The Editorial Board was to consist, on an equal footing, of the Iskra Editorial Board, and Struve and Tugan-Baranovsky.
The talks revealed that Struve intended to use the Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya to cater for Sovremennoye Obozreniye and was trying to turn it into an organ competing with Iskra in volume, content and frequency of publication.
When the draft agreement was being worked out, Struve rejected Clause 7, which had been proposed by the Iskra and Zarya group and which gave the Iskra Editorial Board a completely free hand in making use of all the political material received by Sovremennoye Obozre-niye.
Lenin set out the content of the talks with Struve in a letter to G.
V.
Plekhanov on January 30, 1901, and came out strongly for breaking off the talks (see present edition, Vol.
34, pp.
55-57).
The subsequent talks ended in a complete break.
p.
34 6Zarya (Dawn)—a Marxist scientific and political journal pub-lished in Stuttgart in 1901 and 1902 by the Iskra Editorial Board.
Altogether four issues (three books) of Zarya made their appear-ance: No.
1 in April 1901 (actually March 23, new style), No.
2-3 in December 1901, and No.
4 in August 1902.
Zarya’s tasks were defined in a draft declaration by the Iskra and Zarya Editorial Board, written by Lenin in Russia (see present edition, Vol.
4, pp.
320-30).
In view of the fact that during the discussion of the publication of these organs abroad, jointly with the Emancipation of Labour group, it had been decided to publish Zarya legally and Iskra illegally, the declaration of the Iskra Editorial Board in October 1900 no longer made mention of Zarya.
The journal Zarya criticised international and Russian revi-sionism and came out in defence of the theoretical principles of Marxism.
Some of Lenin’s works, including “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism” and “TheAgrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”, were pub-lished in Zarya.
p.
35 7A reference to Minister of Finance S.

p.
35 8The Zemstvos were introduced in the central gubernias of Russia in 1864 and were local organs of self-government led by the gentry.
Their writ was confined to local economic matters (hospi-tals, highways, statistics, insurance, etc.
).
Their activity was entirely under the control of the governors and the tsarist Ministry of the Interior, who could suspend any decisions the government did not like.
p.
36 9A reference to the newspaper Iskra, the first all-Russia illegal Marxist newspaper, founded by Lenin in 1900, which played a deci-sive part in organising the revolutionary Marxist party of the working class.
The first issue of Lenin’s Iskra dated December 1900 appeared in Leipzig; subsequent issues appeared in Munich; from July 1902, in London; and from the spring of 1903, in Geneva.
German Social-Democrats, Clara Zetkin, Adolf Braun and others, the Polish revolutionary Julian Marchlewski who was living in Munich at the time, and Harry Quelch, a leader of the British Social-Democratic Federation, rendered great assistance in starting the newspaper (organising a secret printing-press, buying Russian type, etc.
).
On Iskra’s Editorial Board were V.
I.
Lenin, G.
V.
Plekhanov, L.
Martov, P.
B.
Axelrod, A.
N.
Potresov and V.
I.
Zasulich.
Its secretary was I.
G.
Smidovich-Lehmann, and from the spring of 1901, N.
K.
Krupskaya, who was also in charge of Iskra’s cor-respondence with Social-Democratic organisations in Russia.
Lenin was the virtual editor-in-chief and head of Iskra; he wrote articles on all the cardinal aspects of Party organisation and the class struggle of the proletariat in Russia Iskra became the centre round which the Party forces rallied and which gathered and trained the Party cadres.

groups and committees, supporting the views put forward by Lenin’s Iskra, were set up in a number of cities in Russia (St.
Peters-burg, Moscow, Samara, etc.
) and the Iskra organisation in Russia was set up at a congress of Iskra followers in Samara in January 1902.
On Lenin’s initiative and with his direct participation, the Iskra Editorial Board worked out a draft Party programme (published in Iskra No.

12Noumena and phenomena—opposite concepts in Kant’s idealistic philosophy.
Kant held a noumenon to be an incognisable thing in itself, which existed independently of man’s consciousness and was beyond his grasp.
A phenomenon exited only in the mind and was an object of cognition.
This antithesis between noumena and phenomena, which is one of the main propositions of Kant’s subjective idealist epistemology, is used by the ideologists of imperialism and revisionists in their fight against materialism.
Dialectical materialism rejected this antithesis and proved that Kant’s theory is wrong.

in 1903 was worked out by the Editorial Board of Lenin’s Iskra at the end of 1901 and the first half of 1902.
Lenin played an outstanding part in working out the draft.
The prepara-tory material dates from January-February 1902; it is a reflection of key moments in the working out of the draft programme by the Iskra Editorial Board: Lenin’s study of the first draft of Plekha-nov’s programme; his work on his own draft of the theoretical section of the programme and his participation in writing the collective draft of the practical section of the programme.

As a rule, the peasants were deprived of their best lands, which is why the cut-off lands were a means used by landowners to enslave the peasants, and slowed down the elimination of feudal relations in land tenure.

Lenin’s replies were also written on the back of the original on May 1 (14), 1902, at the same time as his letter to Plekhanov (see present edition, Vol.
34, p.
103); the concluding part of Lenin’s replies (pp.

In 1872 and 1873, it collected extensive material on the state of agriculture in Russia following the 1861 Reform, and this was published in a book entitled Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Present State of Agriculture and Agricultural Productivity in Russia, St.
Petersburg, 1873.
p.
57 19A general strike in support of the demand for universal suffrage put forward in Parliament by representatives of the Labour, Liberal and Democratic parties.
The strike involved over 300,000 workers, who staged demonstrations throughout the country.
However, when Parliament rejected the Bill and troops fired on the demonstrators, the opportunist leadership of the Labour Party (Vandervelde and others) capitulated and, under the pressure of their “allies” from the camp of the liberal bour-geoisie, called off the general strike.
The defeat of the working class in Belgium in April 1902 was a lesson for the working-class movement of the world.

21A reference to the following remark by L.
Martov at the Zurich conference of the Iskra Editorial Board on April 2 (15), 1902: “We should emphasise and bring out the reactionary character of the demand for the nationalisation of the land in Russia at the present moment.
” After the Zurich conference, Lenin made several changes in Chapter VII, which deals with the demand for the nationalisation p.
63 of the land (see present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
137-40).
22 A reference to the following remark by L.
Martov: “It must be said instead that we accept the nationalisation of the land only as an immediate prelude to the socialisation of all the means of production.
” p.
64 23 A reference to rewards given by the government of Charles X to former émigrés whose lands were confiscated and sold as national property during the French bourgeois revolution at the end of theeighteenth century.
The law on compensation adopted on March 27, 1825, provided for pecuniary rewards totalling 1,091,360,000 francs (the “émigré billion”).
Members of the royal retinue got the biggest rewards.
To obtain this vast sum of money, the government increased taxes and converted the 5 per cent state rent to 3 per cent.
p.
66 24 A reference to Plekhanov’s remark on the following part of the article: “But why confine oneself to this source? Why not try, in addition, to return to the people at least part of the tribute which yesterday’s slave-owners extracted, and are still extracting, from the peasants with the assistance of the police state?” (See present edition, Vol.
6, p.
142.
) Plekhanov wrote: “That is the only thing that should be proposed, and not charity.
Only those who received the amounts can be expected to return them: the gentry.
” p.
66 25 A reference to the following remark by L.
Martov: “This propo-sition is wrong.
Freedom to demand a separate plot flows precisely from the freedom to dispose of the land.
It is enough to point out instead that the transformation of the power of the commune over the individual into the power of an association over the member who joins on his own accord is not ruled out by our demands.
” After the Zurich conference, Lenin crossed out both sentences in the original and wrote instead: “This objection would be ground-less” ending with “put up for sale by a fellow member” (p.
67).

L.
P.
“To the Citizens of Russia”, issued on May 9 (22), 1902, was circulated among workers in a total of 2,000 copies.
It said that the blood of Balmashev, who had been sentenced to death by a military tribunal for the assassination of Minister Sipyagin, “will wash the eyes of the blinded philistines and make them see the indescrib-able horror of the autocracy in Russia.
Let them see that our struggle against it is growing and spreading.
Masses of peasants are already coming to the assistance of the workers and a handful of unhypocritical intellectuals.
The first signs are already in evidence: in Tula the soldiers have refused to shoot at the strikers; a peasant uprising has broken out in Poltava and Kharkov gubernias.
For centuries the muzhik there had been working for the benefit of his lord, for centuries he had suffered oppression and privation, and his patience has finally come to an end.
” The tsarist government hastened to the rescue of the landowners and started fierce reprisals.
The leaflet went on: “We have had enough of this slavish and ignominious forbearance, we have had enough of sacrifice.

Citizens! Stem the endless tide of this horrible blood-letting! Overthrow the autocracy!” p.
69 27 Socialist-Revolutionaries (S.
R.
s)—a petty-bourgeois party in Russia which originated at the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 from the merger of various Narodnik groups and circles (the Union of Socialist -Revolutionaries, the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc.
).
The views of the S.
R.
s were a jumble of Narodnik and revisionist ideas; they tried, as Lenin put it,to “patch up the rents in the Narodnik ideas with bits of fashion-able opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism” (see present edition, Vol.
9, p.
310).
During the First World War, most of the S.
R.
s took a social-chauvinist stand.
After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917, the S.
R.
s and the Mensheviks were the mainstay of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois and landowner Provisional Government, while the party’s leaders (Avksentyev, Kerensky and Chernov) were in the government.
At the end of November 1917, the Left wing of the S.
R.
s formed an independent party of Left S.
R.
s.
In an effort to retain their influence among the peasants, the Left S.
R.
s gave nominal recogni-tion to the Soviet power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but soon began to fight against the Soviets.
During the foreign armed intervention and the Civil War, the S.
R.
s were engaged in counter-revolutionary subversive activity, giving active support to the interventionists and whiteguards, taking part in counter-revolutionary plots and organising terror-istic acts against the leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party.
After the Civil War, the S.
R.
s continued their hostile activity inside the country and among the whiteguard émigrés.

P.
in November 1902 in con-nection with the strike in Rostov from November 2 to 25 (Novem-ber 15 -December 8).
It refuted the official report in Pravitelstvenny Vestnik (Govern-ment Herald) about the Rostov events, which described the work-ers as an “unruly crowd” with crude demands allegedly of an exclusively economic character.
The leaflet gave a true picture of the strike, which was expressly political, and described the fierce reprisals of the tsarist troops against the workers and their families.
It called on the workers to respond with revolution-ary action to the violence of the tsarist government.
The leaflet ended with these words: “Let the fire that has flared up on the Don spread in a terrible conflagration, let the rifle salvoes be echoed by mighty demonstra-tions, let the groans of the victims be amplified by thunderous protest, let citizens everywhere, as unanimously as in Rostov, pass the death sentence on the autocracy, which is oppressing the country! “Down with the autocracy! “Long live the coming revolution!” The leaflet was published in Iskra No.
31 on January 1, 1903, with an editorial introduction by Lenin, and was also issued in a special reprint.
On the copy of the leaflet received by the Iskra Editorial Board, there is also the following in Lenin’s hand: “Set up i n b r e v i e r right away and issue in a special reprint: Special impression from No.
31 of ‘Iskra’”, together with a calculation of p.

72 33Economism—an opportunist trend within Russian Social-Democracy at the turn of the century, a Russian variety of inter-national opportunism.
The Economists ’ organs were the newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought) (1897-1902) and the magazine Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause) (1899-1902).
The so-called Credo, written by Y.
D.
Kuskova in 1899, was the programme docu-ment of the Economists whom Lenin called Russian Bernsteinians.
The views of the Economists were subjected to comprehensive criticism in Lenin’s works: “A Protest by Russian Social-Demo-crats” (aimed against their Credo and written in 1899 when Lenin was exiled in Siberia; it was signed by seventeen exiled Marxists), “A Retrograde Trend in Russian Social-Democracy”, “Apropos of the Profession de foi” (see present edition, Vol.
4, pp.
167-82, 255-85, 286-96) and “A Talk with Defenders of Economism” (see present edition, Vol.
5, pp.
313-20).
Lenin completed the ideological defeat of Economism in his book What Is To Be Done< (see present edition, Vol.

347-529).
Lenin’s Iskra played a great part in the struggle against Economism.

S.

L.
P.
was held from July 17 (30) to August 10 (23), 1903.
The first 13 sittings were held in Brussels, after which, because of police persecution, the Congress moved to London.
It was prepared by Iskra, which under Lenin’s guidance put in a tremendous effort to unite Social-Democrats in Russia round the principles of revolutionary Marxism.
Iskra’s Editorial Board worked out and proposed for discussion at the Congress a draft Party programme (published in Iskra No.
21 on June 1, 1902).
Several documents for the Congress were written by Lenin: draft Rules of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, several draft resolutions and a plan for the report on Iskra’s activity.
Lenin also worked out in detail the agenda and the standing orders of the Congress.
The draft Rules and the draft agenda of the Congress were communicated beforehand to the members of Iskra’s Editorial Board and then to the delegates.
The Congress was attended by 43 delegates with vote, repre-senting 26 organisations.
Some delegates had two votes each so that the total of votes at the Congress came to 51.
The composition of the Congress was not homogeneous.
It was attended not only by supporters of Iskra, but also by its opponents, and by unstable and wavering elements.
There were 20 items on the agenda of the Congress.
Lenin delivered the report on the Party Rules and spoke in the debate on most of the items of the agenda.
Approval of the Programme and the Rules of the Party and the election of the Party governing centres were the most important questions before the Congress.
Lenin and his supporters launched a resolute struggle against the opportunists.
The Congress gave a rebuff to the opportunists and approved the Party Programme almost unanimously (with one abstention).
It contained a formula-tion of the immediate tasks of the proletariat in the coming bour-geois-democratic revolution (minimum programme) and the tasks designed for the victory of the socialist revolution and the estab-lishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat (maximum pro-gramme).
For the first time in the international labour movement since the death of Marx and Engels, a revolutionary programme was adopted, which stated, on Lenin’s insistence, that the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat was the principal task of the working-class party.
In the debate on the Party Rules there was an acute struggle over the Party’s organisational principles.
Lenin and his support-ers wanted to set up a militant revolutionary party of the working class, which is why the wording of the first paragraph of the Rules proposed by Lenin stated that a member must not only accept the Party’s Programme and give it financial support, but perso-nally participate in the work of one of its organisations.
Martov motioned his own wording of the first paragraph, which stated that a member need only accept the Programme and give the Party financial support, and also give regular personal assistance to the Party under the guidance of one of its organisations.
Mar-tov’s wording, which facilitated access to the Party for unstable elements, was adopted by a small majority.
Otherwise the Con-gress approved the Rules as worked out by Lenin.
The Congress also adopted a number of resolutions on tactical questions.
At the Congress, a split developed between those who con-sistently supported Lenin’s Iskra and the “soft” Iskrists, the supporters of Martov.
The former received a majority in the elec-tion to the Party’s central bodies and accordingly took the name of Bolsheviks, while the latter, the opportunists, received a minor-ity and were called Mensheviks.
The Congress was of tremendous importance for the develop-ment of the working-class movement in Russia Lenin wrote: “As a current of political thought and as a political party, Bolshe-vism has existed since 1903” (see present edition, Vol.
31, p.
24).
The Second Congress of the R.

was a turning-point in the international working-class movement, because it set up a new type of proletarian party, which became a model for revo-lutionary Marxists throughout the world.

78 41This is a detailed elaboration of the standing orders and agenda for the Congress.
Section A was taken as a basis for the standing orders adopted by the Congress.
Section B was the draft agenda (Tagesordnung) supplied with the commentaries, which, Lenin said, “was known t o a l l the “Iskra”-ists long before the Congress and to all the delegates at the Congress” (see present edition, Vol.
7, p.
31).
The initial text of the document was supplemented by Lenin on the strength of remarks received from Martov and possibly other Iskra supporters as well who had studied it.

committees and organisations (March 23-28 [April 5-10], 1902), which was called on the initiative of the Economists and Bundists.

and the Bund Central Committee; it wasunable to start work because two of its members were arrested soon after the conference.
A conference of Iskra supporters, led by Lenin, met in London on August 2 (15), 1902, to set up the nucleus of the Russian O.
C.
It was decided to invite representatives from the Bund and the Yuzhny Rabochy group which at the time showed signs of moving closer to Iskra, and also to give the O.
C.
the right to co-opt members.
A conference of Social-Democratic organisations at which the O.
C.
was constituted was held in Pskov on November 2-3 (15-16).
The conference adopted the text of an “Announcement of the For-mation of an Organising Committee”, which was published as a leaflet in Russia in December 1902.
In early February 1903, the second O.
C.
conference was held in Orel.
It worked out and adopted draft regulations of the Congress and the list of organisations entitled to attend it.
The regulations were circulated among the local committees which were then toured by the members of the O.
C.
They were adopted and approved by the local organisations, and served as the basis for the Organising Committee’s further work in preparing for the Party’s Second Congress.
The O.
C.
’s successful activity, which culminated in the con-vocation of the Congress, was made possible only by the tremen-dous work in uniting Russian revolutionary Social-Democrats carried out by Iskra’s Editorial Board and the Iskra organisation under Lenin’s direction.
In his book, One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, Lenin wrote: “The Organising Committee was mainly a commission set up to convene the Congress, a commission delib-erately composed of representatives of different shades, including even the Bundists; while the real work of creating the organised unity of the Party was done entirely by the Iskra organisation” (see present edition, Vol.
7, p.

78 43 Polish Social-Democrats—members of the revolutionary party of the Polish working class, which emerged in 1893, first as the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland, and from August 1900, following the congress of Social-Democratic organisations of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, where the Polish and a section of the Lithuanian Social-Democrats were merged, it was known as the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (S.
D.
K.
P.
and L.
).
The fact that the party directed the Polish working-class movement towards alliance with the Russian working-class movement and fought against nationalism was to its credit.
At the same time, it made a number of mistakes; it failed to understand Lenin’s theory of socialist revolution, or the leading role of the party in the democratic revolution; it underestimated the role of the peasantry as an ally of the working class and the importance of the national liberation movement.
While criticising the party’s erroneous views, Lenin emphasised its services to the Polish revolutionary movement.
He noted that Polish Social-Democrats had created “for the first time a purely proletarian party in Poland and proclaimed the extremely impor-tant principle that the Polish and the Russian workers must maintain the closest alliance in their class struggle” (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
434).

It was attended by nine delegates from six organisations: the St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Yekateri-noslav and Kiev organisations of the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, from the group of the Kiev Rabochaya Gazeta and from the Bund.
The Congress elected the Party’s Central Committee, confirmed Rabochaya Gazeta as the Party’s official organ, issued a Manifesto and designated the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad as the Party’s repre-sentative abroad (see K.

lay in the fact that its decisions and Manifesto proclaimed the estab-lishment of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, thereby playing a great revolutionary and propagandist part.
But the Congress did not adopt a Programme or work out any Party Rules; the Central Committee elected at the Congress was arrested and the Rabochaya Gazeta printing-press was seized, which is why the Congress failed to unite and merge together separate Marxist circles and organisations.
The local organisations were not guided from a single centre and there was no single line in their work.

Its publications (“Materials for the Working out of a Party Pro-gramme”, parts I-III, “Leaflet of the Borba Group”, etc.
) distorted revolutionary Marxist theory, giving it a doctrinaire and scho-lastic interpretation and taking a hostile attitude to Lenin’s principles of Party organisation.

105-59, 160-65).
Zhizni was closed down by the government in June 1901 and was resumed abroad in April 1902 by the Zhizn Social-Democratic group.
There were six issues of the magazine, twelve issues of the Listok Zhizni (Zhizni Handbill) and several publications in the Biblioteka Zhizni (Zhizni Library) series.
The Zhizn group had some deviations from Social-Democratic views and tactics, inclining towards Christian socialism and anarchism.
It ceased to exist in December 1902 and the publishing business was wound up.

It did much to spread Marxism in Russia and dealt a serious blow at Narodism, which was the main ideological obstacle to the spread of Marxism and to the development of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia.
Written by Plekhanov and published by the Emancipation of Labour group, the two draft programmes of the Russian Social-Democrats (1883 and1885) were an important step in preparing and creating a Social-Democratic party in Russia.
Lenin said that the group “only laid the theoretical foundations for the Social-Democratic movement and took the first step towards the working-class movement” (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
278).
Members of the group also made serious mistakes: they overestimated the role of the liberal bourgeoisie and underestimated the revolutionary role of the peasantry as a reserve of the proletarian revolution.
These mis-takes were the germ of the subsequent Menshevik views held by Plekhanov and other members of the group.
In 1894, the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was formed on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group.
Members of the group and their followers left the Union in 1900 and set up a revolutionary organisation, Sotsial-Demokrat.

Iskra pro-motion groups were set up in a number of cities, including St.
Pe-tersburg, Pskov, Samara and Poltava.
The growth of the revolutionary movement and the increasing volume of practical work insistently urged the need to unite the Iskra forces and place their work on a planned and organised basis, which would help to solve the main task, that of overcoming the amateurish methods introduced by the Economists and winning over the Social-Democratic committees.
In this connection, Lenin put forward a plan for an all-Russia Iskra organisation, which was to prepare the unification of Social-Democratic organisations in the country into an integrated, centralised Marxist party.
This plan was initially set out by Lenin in his article “Where To Begin?” (May 1901) and then elaborated in the pamphlet What Is To Be Done> (autumn of 1901-February 1902) (see present edition Vol.
5, pp.
13-24, 347-529).
In implementing the plan for the establishment of an integrated Iskra organisation in Russia, Lenin and his supporters had to overcome narrow local (regional) tendencies among some Iskra practitioners.
A congress of Iskra workers was held in Samara in January 1902 and was attended by G.
M.

The congress set up a Bureau of the Iskra organisation in Russia.
Armed with Lenin’s book What Is To Be Done>, Iskra workers vigorously set about spreading and realising Lenin’s plan for the establishment of the party.
The Iskra organisation in Russia achieved a great deal in actually uniting party organisations on the principles of revolutionary Marxism.
By the end of 1902, almost all the major Social-Democratic committees had announced their solidarity with Iskra.
The Organising Committee for Convening the Party’s Second Congress, to which the Iskra organisations handed over all their connections, was set up at a conference in Pskov on November 2-3 (15-16), 1902, with the most active participation of Iskra workers.
The Iskra organisation in Russia operated until the Second Congress and played an important part in preparing and convoking the Congress, which set up the revolutionary Marxist party in Russia.

In contrast to the Economists, the Yuzhny Rabochy group be-lieved that the main task of the proletariat was to carry on political struggle for the overthrow of the autocracy.
It opposed terrorism, upheld the idea of launching a mass revolutionary movement and carried out considerable revolutionary work in the south of Russia.
But the group tended to overrate the role of the liberal bourgeoisie and attached no importance to the peasant movement.
In opposition to the Iskra plan for creating a centralised Marxist party through the unification of the revolutionary Social-Democrats round Iskra, the Yuzhny Rabochy group put forward a plan for restoring the R.

by setting up regional Social-Democratic associatlons.
In his One Step Forward, Two Steps Back, Lenin said the Yuzhny Rabochy group was one of those organisations “which, while verbally recognising Iskra as the leading organ, actually pursued plans of their own and were unstable in matters of principle” (present edition, Vol.
7, p.
209).
At the Second Congress of the Party, the Yuzhny Rabochy delegates took a Centrist position (Lenin called them “ middling opportunists”).

(Polska Partia Socjalistyczna—Polish Socialist Party)— a reformist nationalist Party set up in 1892.
It had a programme based on the struggle for an independent Poland, and under the leadership of Pilsudski and his followers it carried on separatistnationalistic propaganda among the Polish workers in an effort to draw them away from joint struggle with the Russian workers against the autocracy and capitalism In 1906 it split up into the P.

These two parties constituted the Communist Workers’ Party of Poland (as the Communist Party of Poland was called until 1925).
During the First World War, the Right-wing P.

continued to conduct its national-chauvinist policy.
When the bourgeois Polish state was formed, the Right-wing P.
P.
S.
in 1919 united with sections of the P.
P.
S.
on the territory of Poland earlier occupied by Germany and Austria and once again took the name of P.
P.
S.
With the government in its hands, it helped the Polish bourgeoisie to take over power and then launched a systematic anti-communist campaign, supporting the policy of aggression against the Soviet state, and the policy of occupying and oppressing Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia.
Some groups in the P.
P.
S.
which disagreed with this policy went over to the Communist Party of Poland.
Following the fascist coup staged by Pilsudski in May 1926, the P.
P.
S.
was nominally in opposition in Parliament, but actual-ly conducted no active struggle against the fascist regime and continued its anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda.
In this period, Left-wing elements in the P.
P.

P.

split up once again.
Its reactionary and chauvinist section, which called itself “Wol-noëF, RównoëF, NiepodlegloëF” (Freedom, Equality, Independ-ence), took part in the reactionary Polish government in exile (London).

8353The Amsterdam International Socialist Congress of the Second International was held from August 14 to 20, 1904.
It dealt with the following questions: 1) international rules of socialist tactics; 2) colonial policy; 3) general strike; 4) social policy and workers’ insurance; 5) trusts and unemployment, and other questions.
The attitude to bourgeois parties was expressed in a resolution called “International Rules of Socialist Tactics”, which prohibited socialists from taking part in bourgeois governments and censured “any urge to gloss over existing class contradictions with a view to facilitating a rapprochement with bourgeois parties”.
The Congress decisions, while being a step forward, went only a part of the way and were a further concession to opportunism.
The Congress failed to raise the question of the mass strike developing into an armed uprising or to give a rebuff to Right-wing opportun-ists who were inclined to justify the colonial policy of the impe-rialist powers.
While saying that it condemned revisionism, the Congress failed to declare a break with it, and said nothing about the proletarian revolution or the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Committee Abroad on February 7, 1903.
The terms on which the Polish Social-Democrats could be united with the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
were discussed at the Fourth Congress of the S.
D.
K.
P.
and L.
which was held from July 11 to 16 (24-29), 1903.
The Congress formulated a number of terms for a possible merger, one of them being the demand for a change in the formulation of the R.

L.
P.
’s Programme clause on the right of nations to self-determination.
When the Second Congress of the R.

opened, its dele-gates had no knowledge of this decision.
The committee to deter-mine the composition of the Congress and verify mandates, in its report to the Congress on July 18 (31), read out a letter from the Polish Social-Democrat A.
Warski (A.
S.
Warszawski), which it had at its disposal.
But the letter did not clarify the relations the Polish Social-Democrats wanted to establish with the R.

The committee decided to invite the Polish Social-Democrats to attend the Congress with voice only.
A.
Warski and J.
Hanecki arrived at the Congress on July 22 (August 4) and Warski announced the decision of the Fourth Congress of the S.
D.
K.

and L.
concerning the terms for unification with the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
A special committee was elected to examine these terms.
The point on the right of nations to self-determination, raised by the Polish Social-Democrats, was discussed in the Programme Committee.
No minutes were taken, but the notes made at the third sitting of the committee by Lenin (see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol.
7, pp.
423-24) show that thePolish Social-Democrats objected to the point on the right of nations to self-determination and proposed that the programme should contain a demand for the establishment of institutions guaranteeing complete freedom of cultural development for all nations within a state.
As Lenin later pointed out: “instead of self-determination they practically proposed the notorious ‘cul-tural-national autonomy’, only under another name” (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
444).
The committee rejected the proposals of the Polish Social-Democrats.
Realising that they would be unable to maintain these proposals at the Congress, they left it after making a statement setting out their standpoint.
Their statement was read out at the Congress on July 29 (August 11).
On August 6 (19), in connection with the report by the committee, which had examined the terms for a merger of the S.
D.

The speech reported here is Lenin’s second.
The first was given in Vol.
6 of the present edition, p.
483.
p.
86 58A reference to an amendment to the paragraph of the general section of the draft programme which said: “But as all these contra-dictions, which are inherent in bourgeois society, increase and develop, the discontent among the labouring and exploited masses with the existing state of things grows, the number and the soli-darity of proletarians increase, and their struggle against their exploiters becomes sharper.
” When this paragraph was discussed by the Programme Committee (a sitting Lenin did not attend) the word “consciousness” was inserted after the words “the number and the solidarity”.
The amendment was rejected by the Congress, with a majority voting for the original wording.
p.
86 59The point at issue is § 1 of the general political demands of the draft Party programme, which was given the following wording by the Programme Committee: “The sovereignty of the people, that is, concentration of all the supreme state power in the hands of a legislative assembly constituting a single chamber and made up of representatives of the people” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
179).
K.
M.
Takhtarev (Strakhov) proposed that the words “sovereignty of the people” should be substituted by the words “supremacy of the people”.
His amendment was rejected by the Congress.
p.
86 60A reference to § 3 of the general political demands of the draft Party programme tabled by the Programme Committee and con-taining a demand for broad local and regional self-government.
p.
87 61A reference to § 9 of the general political demands of the draftprogramme (§8 of the Iskra draft), which said: “The granting to every citizen of the right to institute judicial proceedings against any person in office without lodging a complaint with his superiors”.
V.
N.
Krokhmal (Fomin) proposed that the word “citizen” should be followed by “and to every foreigner”.
The Congress rejected the proposal.
p.
87 62In the discussion of § 12 of the general political demands of the draft programme (§ 9 of the Iskra draft), which said that the stand-ing army should be substituted by the “universal arming of the people”, Lieber proposed that the word “militia” should be used instead of the “universal arming of the people”.
Lieber’s proposal was rejected by the Congress.
p.
87 63The draft proposals here published were tabled by Lenin at a sit-ting of the Programme Committee during the second discussion of the wording of § 7 of the general political demands of the Party Programme (§ 6 of the Iskra draft).
In the Iskra draft programme this paragraph contained a demand for the abolition of the social estates and full equality of rights for all citizens, regardless of sex, creed or race.
During the initial discussion, the end of the paragraph had been reworded as follows: “Creed, race, nationality and language”, and was so tabled at the 16th sitting of the Congress on July 30 (August 12).
During its discussion at the Congress, the Bundists demanded the inclusion in the Party Programme of a special point on the “equality of languages”.
They succeeded in winning over a section of the vacil-lating Iskra supporters and there was a split when the proposal was put to the vote.
The wording of § 7 was again referred to the Programme Com-mittee.
Lenin’s proposals with slight stylistic changes were adopt-ed by the committee and on its behalf tabled at the 21st sitting of the Congress on August 1 (14).
The Congress rejected the first point of the proposals and adopted the second with some amend-ments (§ 8 in the Programme adopted by the Congress); point three was adopted without alteration.
Paragraph 11, of which Lenin spoke in point 3 of his proposals, had the following wording in the Iskra draft: “Free and compulsory general and vocational education for all children of either sex up to the age of 16.
Provision of poor children with food, cloth-ing and study aids at the expense of the state.
” The Programme Committee initially adopted this paragraph without amendment (§ 14), but during its discussion at the 18th sitting of the Congress on July 31 (August 13) the following addendum was adopted: “Instruction in the native language, on the demand of the popula-tion” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
198).
This addendum became superfluous with the adoption of a separate point on the question of language.
p.
87 64The point at issue is § 2 of the section of the draft programme dealing with labour protection, which contained a demand for a statutory weekly period of rest running continuously for at least 36 hours, for wage-workers of either sex in all branches ofthe national economy.
Lyadov proposed that the period should run for 42 hours; Lieber remarked that the programme said nothing about supervision in small-scale production.
Lyadov’s proposal was adopted by the Congress, and Lieber’s amendment was reject-ed.
p.
88 65The point at issue is § 12 of the section of the draft programme dealing with labour protection (§ 11 of the Iskra draft), which contained a demand for “supervision by the organs of local self-government, with the participation of workers’ delegates, over the sanitary state of the living quarters provided for workers by their employers, and also over the internal regulations on these premises and the terms of their lease, to safeguard wage-workers against intervention by employers in their life and acti-vity as private persons and citizens”.
Lyadov motioned the following addenda to this paragraph: 1) agrarian inspection to be established for supervision over all agricultural enterprises employing wage labour; 2) points 1-13 of the section of the programme dealing with labour protection to be extended to all agriculture with wage labour; 3) tenants holding land as sharecroppers, or indentured to cultivate the landowner’s land, to be regarded as wage-workers falling within the province of the agrarian inspection.
The Congress rejected the first two addenda and Lyadov withdrew the third.
p.
88 66The amendment was motioned by Lenin during the discussion of the preamble of the draft programme on the agrarian question, which said: “For the purpose, however, of eliminating the surviv-als of the serf system, which are a heavy burden on the peasants, and in the interests of the free development of the class struggle in the countryside, the Party will work for.
.
.
.
” The Congress adopted the amendment.
p.
88 67The point at issue is § 1 of the draft programme on the agrarian question, which contained a demand for the “abolition of land redemption and quit-rent payments and all other services now borne by the peasants as a poll-tax paying estate”.
Lyadov pro-posed the addition: “or other rural inhabitants, as poll-tax paying estates”.
The amendment was rejected by the Congress.
p.
89 68During the debate on § 2 of the draft programme on the agrarian question, which spoke of the need to abolish collective liability and all other laws hampering the peasant in his disposal of the land, Martynov asked this question: “How are we to under-stand the words: ‘his land’?” He believed that two interpretations of this point were possible: “1) every peasant has the right of redemption; in that case the interests of the commune are not infringed; 2) every peasant has the right to appropriate the land without redemption.
” Following Lenin’s explanation, Martynov spoke again and said that he was not thinking about particulars but about the general principle: who was the owner of the land— the commune or the peasant? He went on: “If it is the commune then regarding it as a constraint on economic development, westand for the right of redemption.
If it is the peasant, there is no need for redemption” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
235).
p.
89 69Paragraph 4 of the draft programme on the agrarian question con-tained a demand for the “establishment of peasants’ committees: a) for the restitution to the village communes (by expropriation or, when the land has changed hands, by redemption by the state at the expense of gentry-owned large landed estates) of the land cut off from the peasants when serfdom was abolished and now used by the landlords as a means of keeping the peasants in bondage, b) for the elimination of the survivals of serf rela-tions, which have been preserved in the Urals, in the Altai, in the Western territory and in other regions of the state.
.
.
”.
N.
N.
Jordania (Kostrov) motioned the following addendum to this point: “for the transfer into the ownership of the peasants in the Caucasus of the lands of which they have the use as tempo-rarily bound, khizani, etc.
” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
243).
The second proposal was motioned by B.
M.
Knunyants (Rusov) and M.
N.
Lyadov, who believed that it was possible for the programme to confine itself to a general statement of the need for eliminating the survivals of serf relations all over Russia.
The amendment of D.
A.
Toputidze (Karsky), mentioned by Lenin in his speech, was not entered in the minutes of the Congress.
The Congress adopted Jordania’s addendum.
Khizani—the name given to the peasants of Georgia who settled on the lands of the landowners on specially agreed terms.
The khizani were not officially regarded as serfs, and enjoyed personal freedom, but remained perpetual tenants without any rights.
The 1861 Peasant Reform did not apply to them and they continued to be completely dependent on the landowners, who began to increase khizani services and confiscate the land they held.
The khizani system was abolished after the Great October Socialist Revolution.
Temporarily bound peasants—the name given to those former serf peasants who were compelled to perform certain services (quit-rent or corvée) for the use of their land even after the aboli-tion of serfdom in 1861 and until they started paying redemption money to the landowner for their allotments.
From the moment the redemption contract was concluded, the peasants ceased to be “temporarily bound” and became “peasant property-owners”.
p.
90 70Paragraph 5 of the draft programme on the agrarian question spoke of the need to empower the courts to reduce excessive rents and declare invalid transactions of an enslaving character.
§ 16 of the section of the draft programme dealing with labour protection contained the demand for the establishment of industrial courts consisting of an equal number of workers’ and employers’ repre-sentatives in every branch of the national economy.
p.
90 71Lenin’s objection is against Lieber’s proposal to introduce into § 5 of the draft programme on the agrarian question the demand p.
90 to empower the courts to establish land-lease prices.
72During the debate on the first clause of § 4 of the draft Rules— the order governing the appointment of members of the Party Council and the replacement of outgoing Council members—the Rules Committee failed to reach agreement and three formulations were put before the Congress.
The first, motioned by L.
Martov and V.
A.
Noskov (Glebov), said: “The Party Council shall be appointed by the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and the Central Committee, each of whom shall delegate two members to the Council; these four members of the Council shall invite the fifth; outgoing members of the Council shall be replaced by the institutions appointing them.
” The second, tabled by V.
I.
Lenin and V.
N.
Rozanov (Popov), said: “The Party Council shall be appointed by the Congress from among the members of the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and the Central Committee and shall consist of five persons, with at least two of them from each of these collegiums.
The Council itself shall replace the outgoing members of the Council.
” The third, motioned by Y.
Y.
Levin (Yegorov), said: “The Congress shall elect two members of the C.
C.
and two of the Edito-rial Board of the Central Organ to the Council of the Party.
These four elected members shall unanimously elect the fifth; outgoing members of the Council shall be replaced by the organisations to which they belong, with the exception of the fifth, who shall be replaced in the manner specified above.
” As a result of the discussion of this question, the Congress adopted the following formulations: “4.
The Congress shall appoint the fifth member of the Council, the Central Committee and the Editorial Board of the Central Organ.
“5.
The Council of the Party shall be appointed by the Editorial Board of the Central Organ and the C.
C.
, each of whom shall dele-gate two members to the Council; outgoing members of the Council shall be replaced by the institutions appointing them, the fifth shall be replaced by the Council itself” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
426).
p.
91 73In the discussion of the first clause of § 4 of the draft rules, Vera Zasulich said: “The objection that the four members of the Council will be unable to elect the fifth is groundless: if an insti-tution like the Council is unable to elect a fifth member, it means that it is altogether incapable of operating” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
296).
p.
91 74The point at issue is § 10 of the draft Rules, which says: “Every member of the Party and every person having any dealings with the Party shall have the right to demand that his statement, in its original form, is communicated to the Central Committee or to the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, or to the Party congress” (Vtoroi syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, 1959, p.
426).
Lenin spoke against Martov’s proposal to remove the words “and every person having any dealings with the Party”.
Martov’s proposal was reject-ed.
p.
9175The speech relates to § 12 of the draft Party Rules dealing with the co-optation to the Party’s collegiate institutions, including the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
In his book One Step Forward, Two Steps Back Lenin wrote: “Greater strictness as regards the majority required for adoption of members (four-fifths instead of two-thirds), the requirement of unanimity for co-optation, mutual control over co-optation to the central bodies—all this we began to advocate when we found ourselves in the minority on the question of the personal composition of the central bodies” (see present edition, Vol.
7, p.
296).
Martov came out against the proposal that the demand for the unanimity and mutual control of the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
in matters p.
91 of co-optation should be written into the Rules.
76Y.
Y.
Levin (Yegorov) objected to any qualification (two-thirds or four-fifths) of the majority necessary for co-optation to the Party’s collegiate institutions, believing that in the absence of any motivated protest the question could be decided by a simple majority.
p.
91 77Y.
Y.
Levin (Yegorov) said in his speech that the draft Rules were “lame” because they contained no point empowering the Party Council to decide on the question of co-optation to the Party central bodies.
p.
92 78A reference to the speeches of Trotsky and Martov objecting to Lenin’s proposal that §12 of the Party Rules should state that the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
Editorial Board could co-opt members only with the consent of all the members of the Party Council.
p.
92 79A reference to Martov’s proposal during the debate on § 12 of the draft Rules: “In the event no unanimity is reached in co-opting new members to the C.
C.
or to the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, the question of the member’s admission may be referred to the Council, and in the event it annuls the decision of the colle-gium in question, the latter shall take a final decision by a simple p.
93 majority” (Vtoroi syezd R.

Martov’s amendment was adopted by the Congress by 24 votes to 23.
p.
93 81The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was founded in October 1901 on Lenin’s initiative.
Affiliated to the League were the Iskra organisation abroad and the Sotsial-Demokrat revolutionary organisation which included the Emancipation of Labour group.
The task of the League was to spread the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy and to help create a militant Soci-al -Democratic organisation.
Under its Rules, the League was the Iskra organisation abroad.
It recruited Iskra supporters from among Russian Social-Democrats abroad, gave Iskra mate-rial assistance, organised the delivery of the newspaper to Russia and published popular Marxist literature.
The Second Congressof the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
confirmed the League as the only Party organi-sation abroad with the status of a committee, authorising it to work under the guidance and control of the R.
S.

P.
Central Committee.
After the Second Congress, the Mensheviks entrenched themselves in the League and launched a struggle against Lenin and the Bol-sheviks.
At the League’s Second Congress in October 1903, the Mensheviks secured the adoption of new Rules aimed against the Party Rules, as approved by the Second Congress of the R.
S.

From then on the League became a Menshevik strong-hold.
It operated until 1905.
p.
93 82In his speech Lenin replies to V.

G.
Deutsch, who proposed that § 13 (on the recognition of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad as the only R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
organisation abroad, and on its tasks) should not be included in the Rules, but referred for discussion to the Central Committee (Glebov) or to the Party Council (Deutsch).
§ 13 of the Rules was adopted by 31 votes to 12, with 6 absten-tions.
p.
93 83Following the approval by the Congress of §13 of the Rules, recognising the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad as the R.

L.
P.
only organisation abroad, delegates of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, Martynov and Akimov, informed the Bureau of the Congress that they would not take part in the voting and would attend the Congress only to hear the minutes of earlier sittings and to discuss the manner of their publication.
Their statement was read out at the 27th sitting of the Congress on August 5 (18).
The Congress invited Akimov and Martynov to withdraw their statement, but they rejected the proposal and walked out.
Lenin did not move the draft resolution at the Congress.
In the original the draft is crossed out.
The reason may have been that the Bureau of the Congress had decided to refer the question for discussion at the Congress.
p.
93 84The Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was founded in 1894 on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group, on the understanding that all its members accept the programme of the group.
The First Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
recognised the Union as the Party’s representative abroad.
Subsequently opportunist elements—Economists (the so-called “young”)—gained the upper hand in the Union.
The opportunist majority of the First Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, held at Zurich in November 1898, refuged to voice solidarity with the Manifesto of the First Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
In view of this, the Eman-cipation of Labour group announced at the Congress its refusal to edit publications of the Union, with the exception of No.
5-6 of Rabotnik which had been prepared for the press, and Lenin’s pamphlets, The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats and The NewFactory Law.
In April 1899, the Union started to publish the magazine Rabocheye Dyelo on whose Editorial Board were the Economists B.
N.
Krichevsky, V.
P.
Ivanshin and P.
F.
Teplov.
The Union voiced its sympathy with E.
Bernstein, the Mille-randists, etc.
The struggle within the Union continued until its Second Congress in April 1900 and at the Congress.
The Emancipation of Labour group and its followers walked out from the Congress and formed an independent organisation called Sotsial-Demokrat.
At the Second Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, representatives of the Union (Rabocheye Dyelo supporters) adopted an extremely opportunist stand and walked out when the Congress recognised the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad as the Party’s only organisation abroad.

M.
Knunyants (Rusov) motioned a proposal to start elections to the Party Central Committee.
p.
95 87The Congress adopted two resolutions on the question of the atti-tude to the liberals: the first was motioned by Potresov (Starover), the second, by Lenin, Plekhanov and 13 other delegates (for Plekhanov’s draft with Lenin’s amendment see Lenin Miscel-lany VI, pp.
177-78).
Lenin subsequently wrote: “The views of the old Iskra were much better expressed in Plekhanov’s resolution, which empha-sised the anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian character of the liberal Osvobozhdeniye, than in the confused resolution tabled by Starover, which, on the one hand, aimed (quite inopportunely) at an ‘agreement’ with the liberals, and, on the other, stipulated for it conditions that were manifestly unreal, being altogether impossible for the liberals to fulfil” (see present edition, Vol.
7, p.
498).
p.
96 88Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation)—a fortnightly journal published abroad from June 18 (July 1), 1902 to October 5 (18), 1905, under the editorship of P.
B.
Struve.
It was the organ of the Russian liberal bourgeoisie and expounded the ideas of moderate-monarch-ist liberalism.
In 1903 the Osvobozhdeniye League formed round the journal (officially it came into existence in January 1904).
The League existed until October 1905.
The followers of Osvo-bozhdeniye and the Zemstvo constitutionalists made up the core of the Constitutional-Democratic (Cadet) Party—the principal bourgeois party in Russia, which was formed in October 1905.
p.
96 89The State Council—one of the higher state bodies in pre-revolution-ary Russia.
Set up in 1810 on a proposal by M.
M.
Speransky as a consultative and legislative institution whose members wereappointed and confirmed by the tsar.
It was reorganised by the law of February 20 (March 5), 1906, and was given the right to approve or reject bills after the debate in the Duma, but the tsar retained the power to amend the fundamental laws and issue some of the more important ones.
From 1906, one half of the State Council consisted of elected representatives of the gentry, the clergy and the big bourgeoisie, and the other from the senior civil servants appointed by the tsar.
This made it a highly reactionary institution which rejected even the moderate bills adopted by the Duma.
p.
98 90 The Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad was held at Geneva from October 13 to 18 (26-31), 1903.
It was called at the insistence of the Mensheviks who wanted to oppose it to the Second Congress of the R.
S.

P.
Lenin objected to its convocation and wrote: “A League Congress now will generate more heat than light, i.
e.
, it will contribute nothing to the work abroad” (see present edition, Vol.
34, p.
176).
The congress of the League was attended by 15 supporters of the majority led by Lenin (14 from the second sitting), who had 18 votes, and by 18 Mensheviks (19 from the second sitting) with 22 votes.
The congress discussed the following questions: 1) report by the administration of the League Abroad; 2) report by the League’s delegate at the Second Party Congress; 3) the League’s Rules; 4) elections of the administration.
The central question of the agenda was a report by Lenin, who had been the League’s delegate at the Party Congress.
He described the work of the Second Congress of the R.
S.

and exposed the opportunism of the Mensheviks, showing their unprincipled behaviour at the Congress.
(For Lenin’s report and speeches see present edition, Vol.

Realising that it was futile and impossible to continue the polemic against the opposition, Lenin and the supporters of the majority left the congress and refused to take part in any further debates on this ques-tion.
The Menshevik majority at the congress, in an effort to secure the Party’s central bodies, adopted three resolutions on the second item of the agenda, in which it opposed Lenin’s approach to organ-isational questions and called for sustained struggle against the Bolsheviks.
The congress also adopted the League’s Rules, some of which were aimed against the Party Rules (such as publication of general Party literature under the League’s auspices, relations between the League’s administration and other organisations, bypassing the C.
C.
and the C.
O.

The Party Council approved of his action (see p.
107 of this volume).
Lenin said that the congress of the League was the “climax of the opposition’s campaign against the central bodies” (see present edition, Vol.
7, p.
122).
After the League’s Second-Congress, the Mensheviks turned it into a stronghold in their fight against the Party.

The working out of a new set of rules for the League was a question of principle.

Council, which met at Geneva from January 15 (28) to 17 (30), 1904, was “called on the initiative of the C.

represent-atives for the purpose of discussing measures to co-ordinate the activity of the C.
C.
and the C.

in the publication of Party literature” (Lenin Miscellany X, p.

The Council’s sittings were attended by V.

Lenin, F.

Lengnik, G.
V.
Plekhanov, P.
B.
Axelrod and L.
Martov.
On a motion by Lenin, the Party Council decided to include in the agenda and to discuss first the question of measures to restore peace in the Party.
On behalf of the Central Committee, Lenin motioned a draft resolution on the question on January 15 (28) (see present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
145-47).
When the debate showed the Mensheviks’ negative attitude to the resolution, Lenin and Lengnik motioned another draft resolution on restoring peace in the Party on January 16 (29) (see p.
109), which was adopted by the Council by three votes (Lenin, Lengnik and Plekhanov) to two (Martov and Axelrod).
But instead of proceeding to a concrete discussion of the question of restoring peace in the Party, the Council, over Lenin’s protest, went to vote Plekhanov’s resolution demanding the co-optation of the Mensheviks to the Central Com-mittee.
The resolution was adopted by the votes of Plekhanov, Martov and Axelrod.
Accordingly, the C.
C.
representatives (Lenin and Lengnik) entered a minority opinion on January 17 (30) censuring Plekhanov’s resolution which ignored the will of the majority at the Party’s Second Congress.
The minority opinion was written by Lenin (see present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
148-51).
When the Mensheviks had frustrated every effort to establish peace in the Party, Lenin motioned a draft resolution on the con-vocation of the Party’s Third Congress as the only way out of the situation (see present edition, Vol.
7, p.
152).
By the votes of Plekhanov, Martov and Axelrod, this resolution was rejected and one by Martov against the convocation of the Party congress adopted.
Nor was any agreement reached between the representatives of the C.
C.
and the Mensheviks on the publication of Party litera-ture.
The Party Council rejected the resolutions on this question motioned by Lenin and adopted the resolutions approving of the factional and disorganising activity of the Editorial Board of the Menshevik Iskra.

While admitting that Lenin had the legitimate right to demand that his resolution should be voted on first, Martov nevertheless proposed the follow-ing change in the approach to the question: 1) Is it necessary to issue a call to all the members of the Party? 2) Plekhanov’s concrete proposal.
p.

Fearful of Japan’s growing strength, Russia, France and Germany issued a protest over the Treaty of Shimono-seki and this forced Japan to abandon the idea of annexing the Liaotung Peninsula.

113 105These outlines were the basis of a report on the Paris Commune given by Lenin at Geneva on March 9 (22), 1904.
They were written after a thorough study of Karl Marx’s The Civil War in France (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol.
I, Moscow, 1962, pp.
473-545).
All of Lenin’s references are to the Berlin edition of 1891.
He also makes use of Lissagaray’s History of the Commune of 187 1 and Weill’s History of the Social Movement in France (185-190).
On the basis of these outlines Lenin wrote a “Plan of a Lecture on the Commune” in 1905 (see present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
206-08).
Here turned again and again to the Paris Commune (see, for instance, the articles “Lessons of the Commune” and “In Memory of the Commune”, and Chapter III of the book The State and Revolu-tion—present edition, Vol.

(Internationale Arbeiter Association)—the International Working Men’s Association (First International)—the first inter-national mass organisation of the proletariat set up at an interna-tional workers’ meeting in London called by British and French workers in 1864.
Karl Marx was the organiser and leader of the First International, and wrote its Inaugural Address, Rules and other programme and tactical documents.
The establishment of the First International was the result of long and persistent effortsby Marx and Engels to organise a working-class revolutionary party, Lenin said that the First International “laid the foundation of an international organisation of the workers for the preparation of their revolutionary attack on capital” and “laid the foundation of the proletarian international struggle for socialism” (see present edition, Vol.
29, pp.
306, 307).
The central governing body of the First International was its General Council, of which Karl Marx was a member throughout.
He did a great deal to overcome the petty-bourgeois influences and sectarian tendencies which then prevailed in the labour movement (trade unionism in Britain, Proudhonism and anarchism in Romance countries and Lassalleanism in Germany) and rallied the advanced workers in Europe and America round the principles of scientific socialism.
The First International directed the economic and political struggle of workers in various countries and strength-ened their international solidarity.
It also played a great part in spreading Marxism and introducing socialism into the working-class movement.
After the defeat of the Paris Commune, the working class was faced with the task of setting up mass national parties on the basis of the principles put forward by the First International.
In 1873 Marx wrote: “As I view European conditions it is quite useful to let the formal organisation of the International recede into the background for the time being” (see Marx’s letter to F.
A.
Sorge, September 27, 1873) (Marx and Engels, Selected Correspondence, Moscow, 1965, p.
286).

114 109Proudhonism—an unscientific, anti-Marxist trend of petty-bourgeois socialism named after the French anarchist Proudhon.
Marx and Engels waged a consistent struggle against Proudhon’s attempts to impose his views on the First International.
Proudhonism was subjected to withering criticism by Marx in The Poverty of Philos-ophy.
The resolute struggle conducted by Marx, Engels and their supporters against Proudhonism within the First International ended in the full triumph of Marxism over Proudhonism.
Lenin said Proudhonism was the “stupidity of the petty bour-geois and the philistine”, incapable of accepting the working-class standpoint.
Proudhonist ideas have been widely used by bourgeois “theorists” to advocate class collaboration.
p.
114 110Blanquism—a trend in the French socialist movement led by the outstanding revolutionary and prominent French utopian Com-munist, Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805-1881).
Lenin wrote that the Blanquists hoped “that mankind will be emancipated from wage slavery, not by the proletarian class struggle, but through a conspiracy hatched by a small minority of intellectuals” (see present edition, Vol.
10, p.
392).
They sub-stituted action by a secret group of plotters for the activity of a revolutionary party, failed to take account of the concrete situa-tion in which an uprising could be victorious, and neglected to maintain ties with the masses.

This letter, published by the Commune in No.
115 of Journal Officiel de la République Française (Official Journal of the French Republic) on April 25, 1871, showed that the “government of national defence” merely pretended that it was defending Paris.

.

In England common criminals are often discharged on parole after serving the greater part of their term, and are placed under police surveillance.
On such discharge they receive a certificate called ticket-of-leave, their possessors being referred to as ticket-of-leave men” (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol.

At its first sitting it discussed the questions of calling an inter-party conference of revolutionary and opposition organisations of Rus-sia, and of the forthcoming international congress at Amsterdam.
The second sitting was devoted to a discussion of internal Party questions: 1) the right of the Party’s central bodies (C.
C.
and C.

) to recall their representatives from the Party Council; 2) co-optation to the committees and the Central Committee’s right to seat new members on them; 3) procedure governing the voting by Party organisations on the convocation of the Party’s Third Congress; 4) publication of the minutes of Council sittings, etc.
In view of the fact that three of the five Council members (Plekhanov, Axelrod and Martov) represented the Menshevik opposition, while Noskov took a conciliatory stand, the Party Council adopted Menshevik decisions on the most important internal Party matters (for Lenin’s speeches at the R.

122 123The Latvian Social-Democratic Labour Organisation of the Baltic Area was set up in April 1902 through the merger of several Social-Democratic organisations.

at the Fourth (Unity) Congress in 1906.
The Latvian Social-Democratic Union, set up in the autumn of 1900 abroad, was akin in its demands to the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries and was largely permeated with nationalistic tendencies.
In 1905, the Union gained some temporary influence among a section of the peasants, but was soon ousted by the Lat-vian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
The Union subsequently played no noticeable role of any kind.

In a letter to the R.

If you have agreed to its participation in the conference, you have made a fatal mistake, which must be rectified at all costs.
It is represent-ed in Geneva by a couple of disrupters who publish sheer trivia here and have no serious connections with the Caucasus.
It is a Bund creatura, nothing more, specially invented to cultivate Caucasian Bundism.

The League played an important part in organising the labour movement in Transcaucasia before and during the first revolution in Russia.

In February 1906, the League was dissolved in view of the establishment of united committees of the Bolshevik and the Menshevik factions.

B.
Krasin, V.

Noskov and L.

Galperin—in July 1904.
It consisted of 26 points, nine of which were published in Iskra No.
72 of August 25 (September 7), 1904, under the title “Declaration of the Central Committee”.
The resolution was adopt-ed illegally, without the knowledge of two C.
C.
members: V.
I.
Lenin, who was in Switzerland, and R.
S.
Zemlyachka.
They were thereby deprived of the possibility of standing up for the Party majority’s view in the Central Committee.
In this reso-lution, the conciliators voiced their recognition of the Menshevik Editorial Board of the new Iskra, whom Plekhanov had co-opted.
Three more conciliators were co-opted to the Central Commlttee: A.
I.
Lyubimov, L.
Y.
Karpov, and I.
F.
Dubrovinsky.
The con-ciliators came out against convening the Third Party Congress and dissolved the Central Committee’s Southern Bureau, which had been campaigning for the Congress.
They stripped Lenin of his rights as the Party Central Committee representative abroad, and prohibited the publication of his works without the permis-sion of the C.

collegium.

Lenin issued a sharp protest against the “July Declaration”.
In his letter “To Five Members of the Central Committee” and his pamphlet Statement and Documents on the Break of the Central Institutions with the Party, Lenin esposed the illegal acts of the three members of the Central Committee (see present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
460-61, 527-33).
Lenin was supported by the Party’s local committees—St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, Baku, Tiflis, Imeretia and Mingrelia, Nikolayev, Odessa, and Yekaterinoslav— which resolutely condemned the “July Declaration”.

But contrary to the Congress decision, the Menshevik Martov refused to sit on the Board without the old Menshevik editors (P.
B.
Axel-rod, A.
N.
Potresov and V.
I.
Zasulich), who had not been elected by the Second Congress; so Iskra’s Nos.
46 to 51 came out under the editorship of Lenin and Plekhanov.
The latter subsequently switched to the Menshevik stand and demanded the inclusion on the Board of the old Menshevik editors who had been rejected by the Congress.
Lenin could not accept this and withdrew from the Iskra Editorial Board on October 19 (November 1), 1903; he was co-opted to the Central Committee and from there started a struggle against the Menshevik opportunists.

52 was issued under the editorship of Plekhanov alone, and on November 13 (26), 1903, Plekhanov rode roughshod over the will of the Second Congress by co-opting Axelrod, Potresov and Zasu-lich.
From its No.
52, Iskra ceased to be a militant organ of the revolutionary Marxists.
The Mensheviks turned it into an organ for fighting Marxism and the Party, and a mouthpiece of opportun-ism.

128 138The Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin Publishing House of Social-Democrat-ic Party Literature was set up by the Bolsheviks at the end of the summer of 1904, when Iskra’s Menshevik Board refused to publish statements by Party organisations and members in support of the decisions of the Second Party Congress and in favour of convening the Third Party Congress.
The Publishers were given assistance by local Majority Committees.
p.
128139There is no information about Lenin’s having either written the work or given a lecture on the subject.
The date has been approxi-mated from the fact that the MS.
is on the reverse of the MS.
of Lenin’s remarks to Rosa Luxemburg’s article “The Organisa-tional Questions of Russian Social-Democracy”, which was pub-lished in No.
69 of Iskra on July 10, 1904.
The material on the study of the works by authors whom Lenin mentions in the two plans is published in Lenin Miscellany XXXII.
This material was also used by Lenin for his lectures on “Marxist Views of the Agrarian Question in Europe and Russia”, which he gave at the Russian Higher School of Social Sciences in Paris from February 10 to 13 (23 to 26), 1903 (see Lenin Miscellany XIX, p.
129 pp.
225-48).
140Engels criticised the agrarian programmes of the French and German Social-Democratic parties in his work The Peasant Question in France and Germany (see Marx and Engels, Selected p.
130 Works, Vol.
II, Moscow, 1962, pp.
420-40).
141In the autumn of 1904, the Geneva group of Bolsheviks set up, on Lenin’s initiative, a propagandists’ circle which was largely made up of grass-root Party workers—working-men and young people without theoretical knowledge.
The aim was to train men for work in Russia, and the studies were in the form of reports and lectures.
Lenin was the head of the circle, and conducted the studies on the Party Programme.
Classes were soon stopped when some of the comrades went back to Russia in view of the outbreak of the revolution.
A number of documents characterising the work of the circle are at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
Lenin’s notes, plans of talks and records of the debates on the lectures are published in Lenin Miscellany XV, p.
131 pp.
283-85, 287.
142The meeting was held in the port of London on August 14, 1889, in connection with the start of the dock-workers’ strike for higher per-hour wages and at least four hours of work a day.
Ten thousand workers (including some unemployed) were involved in the strike.
They set up a strike committee, whose secretary was Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Karl Marx’s daughter.
The strikers had the support of workers in Britain, Australia and a number of European ports.
During the strike, the first dock-workers’ union was set up, with branches in all the major British ports.
The strike continued for five weeks and ended when all the workers’ demands were met.
It gave an impetus to the development of trade unions and was p.
132 a turning-point in the British labour movement.
143This is the initial variant and the final text of the “Note by the Vperyod Editorial Board to the Letter of Their St.
Petersburg Correspondent”, which has not been found.
It was apparently to have gone into the newspaper’s issue No.
4 or No.
5, but the January 9, 1905 events must have crowded out the other reports, and then the letter was too old to print.
Vperyod—an illegal Bolshevik weekly, published in Geneva from December 22, 1904 (January 4, 1905) to May 5 (18), 1905 Eighteen issues appeared, with the printing of 7,000 to 10,000 co-pies.
It was organised and run by Lenin, who had also proposed the newspaper’s name.
On its Editorial Board were V.
V.
Vorovsky, M.
S.
Olminsky and A.
V.
Lunacharsky.
The paper’s correspond-ence with local committees in Russia and its reporters was handled by N.
K.
Krupskaya.
Lenin defined the content of the paper as follows: “The line of Vperyod is the line of the old ‘Iskra’.
In the name of the old Iskra, Vperyod resolutely combats the new Iskra” (see present edition, Vol.
8, p.
130).
Lenin not only wrote the leading articles but also a great number of notes, and edited many reports.
He wrote some of the articles together with other members of the Board (Vorovsky, Olminsky and others).
The MS.
s of various authors which have been preserved show the heavy editing and extensive insertions made by Lenin, who always read the page proofs.
Even when he was engrossed in the work of the Third Congress in London, he found the time to read the page proofs of No.
17.
Issue No.
18 appears not to have been read by him in view of his departure from London to Geneva.
More than 60 articles and notes by Lenin were carried in Vperyod, and some of its issues—such as Nos.
4 and 5, dealing with the January 9 events and the start of the revolution in Russia—were almost entirely done up by Lenin The Third Congress passed a special resolution with a vote of thanks, noting the outstanding part played by Vperyod in the struggle against the Mensheviks, for the restoration of the Party principle, in the raising and elucidating of the tactical questions brought out by the revolutionary movement, and in the struggle for the convocation of the Congress.
Under a decision of the Third Congress, Proletary was published as the Central Organ of the Party and a direct successor of Vperyod.
p.
133 144This was written some time in January 1905 as a proposed reply to Plekhanov’s article “On Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal Bourgeoisie Against Tsarism”, which criticised Lenin’s pamphlet The Zemstvo Campaign and Iskra’s Plan.
Lenin’s article did not appear in the press, and does not seem to have been written.
p.
134 145In his article “On Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal Bourgeoisie Against Tsarism”, Plekhanov alleged there was a con-tradiction between Lenin’s old (What Is To Be Done>) and his new (The Zemstvo Campaign and Iskra’s Plan) attitude to the Zemstvo liberal movement.

135 146A reference to the acts of the Chairman of the Zemstvo Assembly in Tambov Gubernia, who on December 14 and 15, 1904, requested police protection for his Assembly against the “public”.
Plekhanov’s “On Our Tactics Towards the Struggle of the Liberal Bourgeoisie Against Tsarism” says: “By the way, about the panic.
The recent Tambov events may perhaps put someof the opponents of absolutism in mind of the idea that Moskovskiye Vedomosti was quite right in threatening the liberals with a popu-lar uprising against constitutionalism” (G.

P.
, set up on Lenin’s initiative at the end of 1904.
In that period, the Party was in a profound crisis.
The Mensheviks had seized the Party centres and were engaged in disorganising and splitting the Party organisations in the localities, and disrupting the unity of working-class action.
Meanwhile, the revolutionary situation in the country demanded cohesion of the Party’s forces and militant unity of the proletariat.
This dictated the need for an early convocation of the Third Party Congress, which was frustrated in every possible way by the central bodies, which were in the hands of the Mensheviks.
Under Lenin’s leadership, the Bolsheviks launched a campaign for convening the Congress.
A great part was played by the conference of 22 Bolsheviks called on Lenin’s initiative in Geneva in August 1904.
It adopted an appeal “To the Party”, written by Lenin, which became a pro-gramme for Bolshevik struggle for the convocation of the Third Congress.
Three regional conferences of Bolshevik committees— Southern, Caucasian and Northern—were held in Russia from September to December 1904.
They set up the Majority Commit-tees’ Bureau, which included V.

Members of the Narodnoye Pravo Party set themselves the task of uniting all opposition forces to fight for political reform.
The party put out two programme documents: “ Manifesto” and “Vital Question”.
In the spring of 1894 it was broken up by the tsarist government.
Lenin gave an assessment of the Narodnoye Pravo Party as a polit-ical organisation in his What the “Friends of the People” Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats and The Tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats (see present edition, Vol.

129-332 and Vol.

A sitting of the organisation section on March 5, 1905, discussed a report by A.
M.
Essen (Stepanov) on how to organise work mainly among the non-proletarian sections of the population (students, soldiers and peasants).
Lenin spoke thrice: first, after the report, then after a speech by Robert (unidentified), and again in connection with a speech by Olga (S.
N.
Ravich), who proposed that Lenin should be invited to take part in drawing up a “question-naire” in view of his wide experience of practical work in Russia.
When Lenin says: “I did draw up a questionnaire, but it was much too general”, he means his “Questionnaire” (see present p.

Lenin gave an assessment of the agreement in his articles “The Second Step” and “The Council Is Caught Out” (see present edition, Vol.

It had been prepared by the Bolsheviks and was directed by Lenin.

The Congress was attended by 38 delegates: 24 with vote, and 14 with voice only.

Lenin was elected chairman of the Congress.
The Congress examined the basic questions of the unfolding revolution in Russia and determined the tasks of the proletariatand its party.
Lenin wrote the draft resolutions on all the main questions debated by the Congress.
He gave reports on Social-Democratic participation in a provisional revolutionary govern-ment and on the resolution concerning support for the peasant movement; he spoke on the armed uprising, the attitude to the government’s tactics on the eve of the revolution, the relations between the workers and intellectuals in Social-Democratic organ-isations, the Party Rules, the report on the Central Committee’s activity and other questions (see present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
359-424).
The Congress laid out the Party’s strategic plan for the bourgeois-democratic revolution and defined the Party’s tactical line.
The Congress set out the organisation of an armed uprising as the Party’s most important and pressing task.
The Congress said that the victory of the armed popular uprising should lead to the establishment of a provisional revolutionary government, whose task would be to suppress the resistance of the counter-revolution, carry out the R.

minimum programme, and prepare the conditions for the transition to a socialist revolution.
The Congress reviewed the Party Rules: it adopted Lenin’s formulation of Paragraph One, which deals with Party member-ship; eliminated the duocentric system (the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
) in the Party, and set up a single governing Party centre—the Central Committee; it gave a precise definition to the C.
C.
’s powers and its relations with the local committees.
The Congress condemned the acts of the Mensheviks and their opportunism in organisational and tactical questions.
In view of the fact that Iskra had fallen into Menshevik hands and was conducting an opportunist line, the Congress authorised the Central Committee to set up a new Central Organ, Proletary.
A Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee on April 27 (May 10), 1905, appointed Lenin editor of the newspaper.
The Third Congress was of tremendous historical importance.
It was the first Bolshevik congress, which gave the Party and the working class a militant programme of struggle for the victory of the democratic revolution.
For the work and importance of the Congress see Lenin’s article “The Third Congress” (present edition Vol.
8, pp.
442-49).
The Congress decisions were substantiated in Lenin’s book Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution (see present edition, Vol.

V.
V.
Adoratsky, a member of the Kazan Committee, was abroad at the time.
To ensure the attendance of the Kazan organ-isation, Lenin wrote to the Credentials Committee, suggesting that Adoratsky should be invited to attend the Congress with voice but no vote as a member of the Kazan Committee.
The Credentials Committee proposed that Adoratsky should be invited “simply as a member of the Party”, and it is this formula that Lenin found strange.
The Congress, by a majority, with two against, decided to invite Adoratsky “as a member of the committee”.
It proved to be impossible to inform Adoratsky of this decision, and he did not attend the Congress.
Only by the eighteenth sitting did a delegate from the Kazan Committee arrive.
He was I.
A.
Sammer (Savich), who was allowed voice but no vote.

A.
Alexeyev (Andreyev) motioned this resolution: “The O.

147), which was adopted by the Congress.

146 160The draft agenda was discussed at the third, afternoon, sitting on April 13 (26), 1905.
Variants of the draft agenda are published in the “Preparatory Material” section of Vol.
9 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works (pp.
375-78).
This draft was circulated among the delegates for comments, and then with slight changes in the wording was read out at the Congress as the draft signed by Lenin, M.

p.
147 161The proposal put forward by D.

V.
Lunacharsky (Voinov) and L.
B.
Krasin (Zimin) was that the Congress agenda should be drawn up under four heads: organi-sational questions, tactical questions, attitude to other parties and delegates’ reports.
This proposal was adopted.
In the subse-quent discussion and amendment, the agenda was adopted with these main heads: 1) tactical questions; 2) organisational questions; 3) attitude to other parties; 4) work within the Party; 5) dele-gates’ reports; 6) elections.

It was pub-lished in No.
13 of Vperyod on April 5 (March 23), 1905, under thetitle “Organisational Question”.
The draft, with some amendments outlined at preliminary meetings of delegates, was read out by Bogdanov (Maximov) at the fifteenth, afternoon, sitting of the Congress on April 20 (May 3).
Following a discussion and the introduction of a number of amendments, the Rules were adopted at the seventeenth, afternoon, sitting on April 21 (May 4).

163Lenin erroneously calls V.
V.
Adoratsky, Arnatsky.
164During the discussion of this question at the fourth sitting of the Congress on April 14 (27), 1905, Lenin said that he had not proposed an invitation for V.
V.
Filatov (NN), but had merely handed his written request to the Congress (see Trety syezd R.

The proposal to invite Filatov to the Congress with voice was rejected.
p.
151 165At the fourth sitting of the Congress (on the morning of April 14 [27]), Lenin spoke twice (for the second speech, see present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
365-67): After the report of the Credentials Committee, there was a debate on the granting of votes to the Bolshevik organ-isations which had existed and worked parallel to the Menshevik committees (the Kharkov and Yekaterinoslav groups and the Committee of the Organisation Abroad) and also to the Archangel Committee, which had not been confirmed.
V.
M.
Obukhov (Kamsky) said that the granting of votes to the “C.
O.
A.
and the parallel groups is a coup d’état in form and in substance”.
Under a Congress decision, all these organisations were given voice but no vote.

Con-gress, only organisations confirmed not less than one year before the Congress had the right of representation at the Congress.
Under the Rules, the Kazan and Kuban committees were not regarded as fully empowered at the Third Congress, because they were not on the list of full-fledged committees in the minutes of the Party Council prior to September 1, 1904.
At the fifth sitting of the Third Party Congress on April 14 (27), V.
V.
Vorovsky (Orlovsky) motioned a draft resolution written by Lenin on con-firming these committees as full-fledged forthwith.
The resolution was adopted at the same sitting.
p.
151 167At the fifth sitting of the Congress on April 14 (27), as it was con-firming the Kazan and Kuban committees as being full-fledged forthwith, some delegates said that it was undesirable for dele-gates with voice only to take part in the voting, as this could have an effect on the results of this crucial decision.
In this connection, Lenin wrote the draft resolution on the procedure governing the voting of questions at the Congress which was adopted at the same sitting.

150168A reference to the speech by A.
I.
Rykov (Sergeyev) at the thir-teenth sitting of the Congress against the draft resolution motioned by V.
I.
Lenin and P.
P.
Rumyantsev (Filippov).
Rykov said that “the resolution does not apply to the agenda ” and that its points “could be referred to the question of the liberals and agitation”; he proposed that they should be examined during the discussion of the corresponding items on the agenda.
The Congress rejected Rykov’s proposal, and adopted the draft resolution.
p.
155 169When the thirteenth sitting of the Congress discussed the draft resolution on the attitude towards the government’s tactics on the eve of a revolution, there was a great debate on point “c” of the resolutive section, which read: “To organise the proletariat for the immediate introduction, in a revolutionary way, of an 8-hour working day and for the implementation of all the main demands of our minimum programme.
” P.
A.
Krasikov (Belsky) objected to the words “revolutionary way”, and proposed their substitution by the words “actual gain”.
As a result of the debate, the point was adopted in the follow-ing wording: “To organise the proletariat for the immediate implementation, in a revolutionary way, of an 8-hour working day and the impending demands of the working class” (see Trety p.
155 syezd R.

170During the discussion at the fifteenth sitting on April 20 (May 3) of the report and draft resolution of A.
A.
Bogdanov (Maximov) on the relations between workers and intellectuals in Social-Democratic organisations, some delegates asserted that there was no such problem in the Party, and that there was no need to adopt any resolution on it.
The Congress resolved to defer the matter until the adoption of the Party Rules.
At the nineteenth sitting on April 22 (May 5), the Congress resumed its discussion of the question.
A number of resolutions were motioned.
Lenin’s draft (see present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
407-08), which he motioned jointly with A.
A.
Bogdanov, was adopted as a basis for the discussion.
Lenin spoke several times (see ibid.
, pp.
411, 412).
By a roll-call vote the Congress decided not to adopt any special resolution on the question.
Lenin’s proposals were taken into account in the resolution on propaganda and agitation.
p.
157 171The speeches were not taken down in shorthand, and in accordance with the standing orders, every speaker had to submit a summary of his speech to the Congress Bureau within two hours of the p.
157 sitting (see Trety syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, p.
11).
172During the debate on the draft Party Rules, the Congress sub-stantially reworked the Party’s organisational principles, chiefly on three main questions: 1) amendment of § 1 of the Rules; 2) pre-cise definition of the powers of the Central Committee and an exten-sion of the autonomy of local committees; 3) establishment of a single centre.
The Congress adopted § 1 as worded by Lenin.
By amajority, the Congress abandoned the dual centre arrangement, in the form of the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
, which the Second Congress had set up.
One centre—the Central Committee—was retained.
The Third Congress devoted a great deal of attention to the demarcation of the powers of the Central Committee and those of the local committees, and to the relations between the committees and the periphery, which was granted more powers.
By a majority, the Congress decided to expunge § 8 from the draft Rules and adopt a special resolution on the question Lenin voted for retaining § 8 in the Rules.
The nineteenth sitting on April 22 (May 5) adopted a resolution motioned by V.
V.
Vorovsky (Orlov-sky) on the duty of the centres to inform the periphery about Party affairs and to reckon with their voice, the resolution which replaced § 8 of the Rules (see Trety syezd R.
S.
D.
R.
P.
, pp.
325, 327-28).
To prevent the committees from abusing their autonomy, and to make it possible to replace the committees which do not justify themselves, §9 of the new Rules said: “A local committee must be dissolved by the C.
C.
if two-thirds of the C.
C.
and two-thirds of the local workers, belonging to the Party organisations declare for such dissolution”.

173§ 6 of the draft Rules published in No.
13 of Vperyod on April 5 (March 23), 1905, said: “All organisations within the Party shall autonomously manage all matters relating specially and exclusively to that sphere of Party activity for the dealing with which they have been set up.
” The Third Congress adopted §6 in a different wording (see Trety syezd R.

p.
158 174Under § 7 of the draft Party Rules, every Party organisation with the right of vote at the Congress had the right to publish Party literature at its own expense and on its own behalf.
O.
A.
Kvitkin (Petrov) came out for § 7 with the amendment of A.
A.
Bogdanov (Maximov) to the effect that “all periodical Party publications shall publish all the C.
C.
statements at its request ” .
P.
A.
Krasikov (Belsky) proposed that permission to publish Party literature should be given only when the practical slogans contained in it were in complete accord with the decisions of inter-national Social -Democratic congresses and Party congresses.
§ 7 of the Party Rules was adopted in the wording proposed by D.
S.
Postolovsky (Mikhailov) with the amendment by A.
A.
Bog-danov (see Trety syezd R.

M.

159 179At the eighteenth sitting of the Congress on April 22 (May 5), the question of the Kazan Committee’s representation came up once again with the arrival of its delegate I.

The Credentials Committee proposed that the Congress “should abide by its earlier decision and admit the Kazan Committee delegate with voice but no vote” (see Trety syezd R.
S.

Sammer asked the Congress to allow his committee a vote.
After a debate, the Congress rejected a resolution motioned by B.

Avi-lov (Tigrov) on granting a vote to the Kazan Committee and confirmed the Credentials Committee’s resolution.
p.
160 180The draft resolution said: “Recognising the unification of Party work to be an urgent demand of Party life, recognising that such unification is best achieved in the process of work and in joint discussion of general Party slogans by as many Party workers as possible—the Third Party Congress recognises it as desirable that the C.
C.
should, for these purposes, organise conferences of repre-sentatives of local committees.

He argued that agreement could be reached only “when it was arranged not only by the C.

This amendment was opposed by Lenin and rejected by the Congress.
p.
162 184In addition to what A.
V.
Lunacharsky (Voinov) said, Lenin quoted a Moscow report which appeared in The Times No.
37700 on May 6, 1905, under the title “Zemstvo Congress at Moscow.
Purposes and Prospects”.
On the Zemstvo congress in Moscow see Lenin’s article “The Advice of the Conservative Bourgeoisie” (present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
457-60).
The Times—a daily founded in London in 1785; one of the leading conservative papers of the British bourgeoisie.
p.
163 185The twenty-third sitting heard and discussed the C.

report given by L.
B.
Krasin (Zimin).
Some speakers noted that the report failed to describe the political activity of the Central Committee and demanded that the C.
C.
representative tell the Congress why the C.
C.
had not succeeded in guiding the Party as its political leader.
Those were the statements Lenin had in mind when he spoke of the “trial” in his second speech on the C.

p.
164187The draft resolution on propaganda and agitation was discussed and adopted at the twenty-second sitting on April 25 (May 8).

p.
165 188Point “c” of the draft resolution read as follows: “take measures to organise in all the main areas of Russia travelling agitation groups under the direction of responsible district agitators, to assist the local centres”.
Lenin’s amendment replaced this text.

Kvitkin’s amendment was adopted.
p.
166 190Lenin gave the lecture on the subject in Geneva on May 19 or 20 (June 1 or 2), and soon after that in Paris.
In a letter to L.
A.
Fo-tieva, who was in Paris, Lenin wrote on June 1 or 2 that he intend-ed to go to Paris and asked her to organise his report on “The Third Congress and its Decisions”.
The content of the report was, Lenin wrote, “a parallel analysis of our decisions and those of the Mensheviks.
They have just issued an announcement about their conference, and I will analyse it” (see present edition, Vol.
36, p.
148).
By announcement he meant the Menshevik pamphlet First All-Russia Conference of Party Workers, issued as a supple-ment to No.
100 of Iskra on May 15, 1905.
In his plan Lenin refers to pages in this pamphlet.
Lenin elaborated on some points of his plan in the article “A Third Step Back”, which was published later (see present p.

8, pp.
544-54).

Zasulich), 16 members of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats (including five members of the Bund Committee Abroad) and three members of the Borba group.
At the Congress Lenin who attended under the name of Frey, spoke about the Union’s opportunist actions.
When the Union tabled its opportunist amendments and addenda to a resolution condemning opportunism and recognising the need for the unity of all Social-Democratic forces in Russia on the basis of Iskra ’ s revolutionary principles the revolutionary section of the Congress (members of the Iskra and Zarya and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisations) issued a state-ment on the impossibility of unification and left the Congress.
On Lenin’s initiative, these organisations in October 1901 united into the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.

The exact meaning of Lenin’s reference to August 13 (26) has not been established.
On November 13 (26) Plekhanov co-opted the Mensheviks Axelrod, Martov, Zasulich and Potresov to the Iskra Editorial Board.
p.

Three other Bolsheviks soon adhered to their decisions and the appeal “To the Party” was issued on behalf of the 22.
This was published in a special leaflet in August 1904 and became the Bolshevik programme in the struggle for convening the Third Party Congress.

p.
169 201A reference to the mutiny on the battleship Potemkin, which broke out on June 14 (27), 1905.
The ship entered Odessa, just then in the grip of a general strike, but no use was made of the favourable conditions for joint action by the workers and sailors.
The Bol-shevik organisation in Odessa had been weakened by arrests, and was not united.
The Mensheviks were opposed to an armed upris-ing and tried to restrain the workers and sailors from offensive operations.
The tsarist government sent the whole of its Black Sea Fleet to crush the Potemkin mutiny, but the sailors refused to fire at the insurgent ship, and their commanders were forced to withdraw the fleet.
After sailing the seas for eleven days, the Potemkin, short of food and coal, made for Rumania and there surrendered to the Rumanian authorities.
Most of its sailors remained abroad.
Those of them who returned were arrested and committed for trial.
The Potemkin mutiny failed but the fact that the crew of a major warship had gone over to the revolution was an important advance in the struggle against the autocracy.
Lenin said the uprising was an “attempt to form the nucleus of a revolutionary army” (see present edition, Vol.
8, p.
562).
p.

p.
171 203Moskovskiye Vedomosti (Moscow Recorder)—one of the oldest Russian newspapers published by Moscow University from 1756 (initially as a small bulletin).
From 1863 to 1887, the ultra-reaction-ary and chauvinist M.
N.
Katkov was its publisher and editor, turning it into a monarchist and nationalist mouthpiece for the most reactionary sections of the landowners and the clergy; from1905, the paper was one of the main organs of the Black Hundreds.
It was published until the October Socialist Revolution.
p.
173 204Vestnik Yevropy (European Messenger)—a historical, political and literary monthly of a liberal bourgeois trend published in St.
Petersburg from 1866 to 1918.
It carried articles against the revo-lutionary Marxists.
p.
173 205Rus (Russia)—a liberal bourgeois daily published in St.
Peters-burg from December 1903.
Its publisher and editor was A.
A.
Suvo-rin.
During the 1905 revolution, the paper was close to the Cadets, but took a more moderate stand.
It was closed down on Decem-ber 2 (15), 1905, and subsequently appeared at intervals under various names: Rus, Molva (Tidings), XX vek (Twentieth Century), Oko (Eye) and Novaya Rus (New Russia).
p.
173 206Proletary (Proletarian)—an illegal Bolshevik weekly, the Central Organ of the R.

L.
P.
, set up under a resolution of the Third Party Congress.
Lenin was appointed its editor-in-chief by a deci-sion of the Central Committee’s Plenary Meeting on April 27 (May 10), 1905.
It was published in Geneva from May 14 (27) to Novem-ber 12 (25), 1905.
There were 26 issues.
The paper continued the line of the old, Leninist Iskra and retained full continuity with the Bolshevik newspaper Vperyod.
Lenin wrote about 90 articles and notes for the newspaper.
Among those who constantly took part in the work of its Editorial Board were V.
V.
Vorovsky, A.
V.
Lunacharsky and M.
S.
Olminsky.
N.
K.
Krupskaya, V.
M.
Velichkina and V.
A.
Karpinsky did a great deal of work for the Editorial Board.
The paper was closely allied with the working-class movement in Russia and carried articles and notes from workers taking a direct part in the revolu-tionary movement.
Local reports were collected and sent on to Gene-va by V.
D.
Bonch-Bruyevich, S.
I.
Gusev and A.
I.
Ulyanova-Yelizarova.
N.

Krupskaya and L.
A.
Fotieva carried on the correspondence with local Party organisations and readers.
Proletary instantly responded to all the important events in the Russian and international labour movement and waged a relentless struggle against the Mensheviks and other opportunist and revisionist elements.
The paper carried out a great deal of work for the propaganda of the Third Party Congress decisions and played an important part in the Bolsheviks’ organisational and ideological unity.
Soon after Lenin’s departure for Russia in early November 1905 the paper ceased publication.
The last two issues (Nos.
25 and 26) were edited by V.
V.
Vorovsky, but they also contained several articles by Lenin, which were published after his departure from Geneva.
p.

174209The Cadets—members of the Constitutional-Democratic Party, the leading party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia.
It was set up in October 1905 and consisted of members of the bourgeoisie, Zemstvo leaders from among the landowners, and bourgeois intellectuals.
Among its prominent leaders were P.
N.
Mi-lyukov, S.
A.
Muromtsev, V.
A.
Maklakov, A.
I.
Shingaryov, P.
B.
Struve and F.
I.
Rodichev.
To deceive the working people, the Cadets called themselves “the party of people’s freedom”, but actually went no further in their demands than a constitutional monarchy.
After the October Socialist Revolution the Cadets operated as bitter enemies of the Soviet power and took part in all the armed counter-revolutionary action and campaigns of the interventionists.
After the defeat of the interventionists and the whiteguards, the Cadets emigrated and continued their anti-Soviet counter-revolutionary activity.

174 211Birzheviye Vedomosti (Stock-Exchange Recorder)—a bourgeois newspaper founded in 1880.
It was published in St.
Petersburg, first thrice a week, then four times a week, and then daily.
From November 1902 it had two editions: morning and afternoon.
Its name became a byword for adaptation, corruption and lack of principle.
It was closed down by the Revolutionary Military Committee at the end of October 1917.
p.
174 212A reference to Karl Marx’s statements about Ledru-Rollin in his work The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol.

p.
174 213This is a critique of the tactical line followed by the bourgeois liberals who, in the magazine Osvobozhdeniye (Emancipation) and other periodicals, sharply opposed the idea of an armed upris-ing, rejected the idea of boycotting the Bulygin Duma and called for participation in it.
Lenin criticised Kautsky’s stand on the provisional revolutionary government (point 3 of the “Note”) in his article “Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution” (see present edition, Vol.
9, pp.
108-09).
The question of making use of “elderly” workers (point 5 of the “Note” was elaborated in Lenin’s letter to S.
I.
Gusev of September 30 (October 13), 1905 (see present edition, Vol.
34, pp.
358-59).
Lenin elaborated the question of the Social-Democratic attitude to parliament (point 6 of the “Note”) in his letter to A.
V.
Luna-charsky of September 28 (October 11), 1905 (see present edition, Vol.

Lenin edited the article and made two insertions.
p.
177 217General redistribution—a slogan expressing the peasants’ striving for a general redistribution of the land and the elimination of landed estates.
In his article “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy”, Lenin said that the demand for a general redistri-bution, together with the reactionary utopian idea of perpetuat-ing small-scale peasant production, also had its revolutionary side, namely, “the desire to sweep away by means of a peasant revolt all the remnants of the serf-owning system” (present edition, Vol.
6, p.
137).
Later, at the Second Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, Lenin said: “We are told that the peasants will not be satisfied with our pro-gramme and will go further.
But we are not afraid of that; we have our socialist programme for that eventuality, and consequently are not afraid even of a redistribution of the land” (present edi-tion, Vol.

The conference was guided by Lenin and was attended by 65 delegates with vote.
Elections to the conference were held after discussion and voting on the tactical platforms of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, with one delegate from thirty voting Party members.
The Bolsheviks won a substantial majority.
The Mensheviks demanded the inval-idation of the votes of the district R.

organisation (see present edition, Vol.

The con-ference confirmed the representation of the district organisation.
It heard a report from the St.
Petersburg Committee and adopted Lenin’s resolution recognising the representation at the confer-ence valid, the conference effective and its decisions binding.
Lenin gave the report on the attitude to the Duma (there is no record of it in the minutes).
At the end of his report Lenin read out a resolution on the tactics of active boycott.
The Menshevikresolution was read out by Martov.
By 36 votes to 29, the confer-ence came out in favour of the active boycott, but had no time to adopt a resolution giving detailed motivation of the tactic.
To discuss this and give it final approval, a second city confer-ence of the St.
Petersburg organisation was called at the end of February and the beginning of March.
It was attended by 62 dele-gates and discussed draft resolutions tabled by Lenin, Martov and an additional one by the Mensheviks of Okhta District.
After a long and bitter struggle, the conference adopted Lenin’s resolu-tion by 35 to 24 with one abstention.
It set up a committee, which included Lenin, to give the final wording to the resolution.
The Mensheviks refused to take part in the committee and walked out.

, and 22 delegates with voice only.
National organisations were also represented: the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania, the Bund, the Latvian Labour Party, the Ukrainian Social-Social-Democratic Democratic Labour Party and the Finnish Labour Party.
There was also a representative of the Bulgarian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
Among the Bolshevik delegates were V.

The Mensheviks had a majority at the Congress because many Bolshevik Party organisations, which had led the armed action by the masses, were broken up and could not send their dele-gates.
The Central Area, the Urals, Siberia and the North—Bolshe-vik bulwarks—were represented by a small number of delegates.
By contrast, the Mensheviks, who had the more numerous organ-isations in the country’s non-industrial areas, where there had been no mass revolutionary action, were in a position to send more delegates.
There was a bitter struggle between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks on every point of the Congress agenda.
Lenin gave reports on the agrarian question, the assessment of the current situation and the class tasks of the proletariat, on the attitude to the Duma, the armed uprising and other questions, and took part in the committee drafting the Party Rules (see present edition, Vol.
10, pp.
277-309).
The character of the decisions was deter-mined by the numerical superiority of the Mensheviks.
Aftera stubborn struggle, the Congress approved the Menshevik resolu-tions on the Duma and the armed uprising, and adopted their agrarian programme.
On the attitude to bourgeois parties, the Congress confined itself to endorsing the resolution of the International Congress at Amsterdam.
Without debate, it adopted the compromise reso-lution on the trade unions and the resolution on the attitude to the peasant movement.
At the same time, on the demand of the Party masses, the Con-gress adopted Paragraph One of the Rules in Lenin’s wording, rejecting Martov’s opportunist formula.
The Bolshevik propo-sition on democratic centralism was included in the Rules for the first time.
The Congress decided on the question of uniting with the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and the Latvian Social-Democratic Labour Party, which joined the R.

181 226First Duma (the so-called Witte Duma) was convened on April 27 (May 10), 1906, under an ordinance worked out by Chairman of the Council of Ministers S.

Witte.
Elected to the Duma were 478 deputies, over one-third of whom belonged to the Cadet Party.
It was dissolved on July 8 (21), 1906.
Trudoviks—a group of petty-bourgeois democrats in Russian Dumas consisting of peasants and Narodnik-minded intellectuals.
The Trudovik group was formed in April 1906 from the peasant deputies of the First Duma.
In the Duma the Trudoviks vacillated between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats, which was due to the class character of the peasant petty proprietors.
In view of the fact that the Trudoviks represented the peasant masses, the Bolsheviks in the Duma pursued the tactic of reaching agreement with them on various questions for conducting a common struggle against the tsarist auto-cracy and the Cadets.
In 1917, the Trudovik group merged with the Popular Socialist Party and gave active support to the bourgeois Provisional Government.
After the October Revolution the Tru-doviks sided with the bourgeois counter-revolution.

From 1905— an organ of the Black Hundreds.
After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917, the paper gave total support to the counter-revolutionary policy of the bourgeois Provisional Govern-ment and fiercely attacked the Bolsheviks.

was held at Tammerfors from November 3 to 7 (16-20), 1906.
It was attended by 32 delegates with vote: 11 from the Mensheviks, 7 from the Bund, 6 from the Bolsheviks, 5 from the Social-Democra-cy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, and 3 from the Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory.
Members of the Central Committee and the Central Organ Editorial Board at-tended with voice only.
The Conference adopted the following agenda: 1.
Electoral campaign.
2.
Party Congress.
3.
Labour Congress.
4.
Struggle against the Black Hundreds and the pogroms.
5.
Partisan activity.
The Menshevik C.
C.
secured a majority for the Mensheviks by bringing in a number of fictitious organisations, which enabled them to impose Menshevik resolutions on some questions.
By 18 votes (Mensheviks and Bundists) to 14, the Conference adopted the Menshevik resolution “On the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
’s Tactics in the Electoral Campaign”, which allowed blocs with the Cadets.
To counter this opportunist resolution, Lenin motioned, on behalf of 14 delegates, a “Minority Opinion”, the Bolshevik platform for the electoral campaign, which emphasised the need for the work-ing-class Party to be organisationally and ideologically independ-ent.
It allowed for the possibility of temporary agreements only with the Trudoviks and the S.
R.
s as representing petty-bourgeois democracy (pp.
188-91) .
Lenin criticised the Menshevik draft elector-al platform, which the C.
C.
submitted for approval by the Con-ference, and motioned a number of amendments.
Under Bolshevik pressure, the Conference adopted a resolution introducing the amendments.
The Conference adopted a resolution “On Unity in the Electoral Campaign in the Localities” with Lenin’s amendment, which put a curb on the Menshevik C.
C.
in practising the tactics of setting up bloc with the Cadets in the localities (see present edition, Vol.
11, pp.
322-23).
Lenin insisted on the need for an emergency Party congress.
The Conference decided to call the next congress not later than March 15 (28), 1907.
Although the Bolsheviks demanded a discus-sion of the question of a “labour congress”, believing agitation for it to be a violation of Party discipline, the Conference did not discuss the question, confining itself to a compromise resolu-tion, “On the Limits of the Agitation for a Labour Congress”.
There was no time to discuss the questions of fighting the Black Hundreds and the pogroms, or the partisan activity.
The Confer-ence authorised the C.
C.
to issue a brief report on the Conference, containing all the draft resolutions and minority opinions.
But the Menshevik C.
C.
, in its organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, published only the Conference resolutions, without the Bolsheviks’ “Minority Opinions”.
Lenin analysed and criticised the work of the Conference in his “Blocs with the Cadets” and “Party Discipline and the Fight Against the Pro-Cadet Social-Democrats” (see present edition, Vol.
11, pp.
307-19 and 320-23).
p.
186230Lenin’s report was based on the Bolshevik resolution, later presented at the Conference as a “Minority Opinion” on behalf of the delegates of the Social-Democracy of Poland, the Latvian Territory, St.
Petersburg, Moscow, the Central Industrial Region and the Volga area (pp.
188-91).

189 233The Second Duma met on February 20 (March 5) 1907.
The elec-tions to the Duma were indirect and unequal, and were held in an atmosphere of reprisals and trials by military tribunals.
Still, the Second Duma turned out to be more Leftist than the First, the reason being the more distinct demarcation between the par-ties than in the First Duma period, the growing class consciousness of the masses and the participation of the Bolsheviks in the elections.
The Bolsheviks used the Duma as a rostrum for exposing tsarism and the treacherous role of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, for proclaiming and propagandising the Party’s revolutionary programme, for releasing the peasantry from the influence of the liberals and creating a revolutionary bloc in the Duma of repre-sentatives of the working class and the peasantry.
This was an entirely new, revolutionary Marxist line of behaviour for prole-tarian delegates to take in a parliamentary institution.
Mean-while, the Mensheviks pursued the opportunist line of supporting the Cadets.
By mid-1907, when it became obvious that the workers and peasants lacked the strength to defeat tsarism, the tsarist govern-ment decided to disperse the Duma.
On the night of June 2 (15), 1907, the Social-Democratic group in the Duma was arrested, and the Duma itself dissolved by the tsar’s decree the following day.

189234Zionist socialists—members of the Zionist Socialist Labour Party, a petty-bourgeois Jewish nationalist organisation formed in 1904.
They believed the main task of the Jewish proletariat to be a struggle for obtaining their own territory and establishing a national state.
They preached class co-operation with the Jewish bourgeoisie, strove to isolate Jewish workers from the revolutionary movement of the Russian and international prole-tariat, and tried to sow hostile feelings among the workers of different nationalities.
The nationalistic activity of the Zionist socialists served to obscure the class consciousness of the Jewish workers and did great harm to the working-class movement.
After the February 1917 bourgeois-democratic revolution, the Zionist Socialist Labour Party merged with the Socialist Jewish Labour Party (S.
J.

The Popular Socialists favoured a bloc with the Cadets.
Lenin used to call them “Social-Cadets”, “philistine opportunists”, “S.
R.
Men-sheviks”, vacillating between the Cadets and the S.
R.
s, and emphasised that the party “differs very little from the Cadets, for it deletes from its programme both republicanism and the demand for all the land ” (see present edition, Vol.

More than 100 articles and notes by Lenin on the most important questions of the work-ing-class revolutionary struggle were published in the paper, which had close contact with local Party organisations.
During the years of the Stolypin reaction, Proletary played an outstanding role in preserving and strengthening the Bolshevikorganisations and in fighting the liquidators, the otzovists-ultimatumists and the god-builders.

Lenin gave reports on the current situation and the agrarian question.
The Conference came out for restoring Party unity and merging the practical centres of the Bolsheviks and the Menshe-viks and their Central Organs on a basis of equality, and also for mergers of parallel organisations in the localities, author-ising the united C.
C.
to call a unity congress.
In its resolution on “Party Reorganisation”, the Conference recommended the practice of a broad electoral principle and the principle of democra-tic centralism.
Departures from the latter were recognised as admissible only in the event of insuperable practical obstacles.
In the “Agrarian Resolution” (on Lenin’s report) the Conference, elaborating the decisions of the Third Congress, proposed that the point in the Party’s agrarian programme dealing with “cut-off lands” should be replaced by the demand for the confiscation of all landed estates and state and church lands.
The Conference adopted a resolution on an active boycott of the First Duma.
In view of the fact that an armed uprising had already started in Moscow, the Conference, on Lenin’s proposal, hastily wound up its work, and the delegates went home to take part in the uprising.

192 239L’Humanité—a daily founded in 1904 by Jaurès as the organ of the French Socialist Party.
In 1905, the paper welcomed the revolution which had started in Russia, voicing the French people’s solidarity with “the Russian nation creating its own 1789”.
The newspaper organised a collection of funds in aid of the Russian revolution.
During the First World War (1914-18) the paper was in the hands of the extreme Right wing of the French Socialist Party and took a chauvinist stand.
In 1918, Marcel Cachin, the outstanding leader of the French and international working-class movement, became the paper’s political director.
From 1918 to 1920, the paper opposed the impe-rialist policy of the French Government, which had sent its troops to fight against the Soviet Republic.
From December 1920, follow-ing the split in the French Socialist Party and the formation of the Communist Party of France, the paper became the latter’s Central Organ.

When the credentials were verified, it turned out that in some sub-districts, mainly represented by the Mensheviks, there had been breaches of the resolution of the St.
Petersburg Committee requiringthat elections of delegates to the Conference should be held only after discussions by Party members of the question of whether agreements with the Cadets ought to be concluded.
The Confer-ence regarded such credentials as invalid.
It rejected the proposal motioned by the representative of the C.
C.
that the Conference should be divided into two sections (the city and the gubernia) in accordance with the existing electoral districts, for the proposal was aimed at giving the Mensheviks an artificial superiority at the Conference.
The Mensheviks used this decision as a pretext for breaking with the revolutionary Social-Democrats and making a deal with the Cadets; they walked out, splitting the St.
Peters-burg organisation on the eve of the election.
The other delegates decided to continue the Conference.
Lenin gave the report on Duma-electoral agreements, and after a debate the Conference affirmed the “Minority Opinion” entered by the Bolsheviks at the Second (First All-Russia) Conference of the R.

The Conference was described in detail in Lenin’s “The Social-Democrats and the Duma Elections”, “ ‘When You Hear the Judge-ment of a Fool’ .

Following a long and sharp debate the Congress adopt-ed this agenda: 1) Report of the Central Committee.
2) Report of the Duma group and its set-up.
3) Attitude to the bourgeois parties.
4) The Duma.
5) “Labour congress” and non-Party labour organisations.
6) Trade unions and the Party.
7) Partisan action.
8) Unemployment, economic crisis and lockouts.
9) Organisational questions.
10) International Congress at Stuttgart (May Day, militarism).
11) Work in the army.
12) Miscellaneous.
In view of the work of the Congress being protracted, the questions of unemployment, of the economic crisis and the lockouts, and the International Congress at Stuttgart were taken off the agenda.
Lenin was elected to the presidium of the Congress and chaired the 6th, 7th, 14th, 15th, 27th, 34th and 35th sittings; he gave the report and delivered the summing-up speech on the key item of the agenda—the attitude to the bourgeois par-ties; he also spoke on the C.
C.
report on its work, the report on the Duma group activity, for inclusion in the agenda of the general theoretical questions of the principles underlying the Party’s tactics in the bourgeois revolution, against the Mensheviks, the Bundists and Trotsky (see present edition, Vol.
12, pp.
437-88).
At the Congress the Bolsheviks were supported by the delegates of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and the Social-Democrats of the Latvian Territory.
Having rallied them on a revolutionary platform, the Bolsheviks secured a major-ity and a victory for the revolutionary Marxist line.
The Congress adopted Bolshevik resolutions on all major questions.
It amended the Party Rules, eliminating the two-centre arrangement (election of the C.
C.
and the C.
O by the congress).
Under the amended Rules, only the C.
C was elected, while the C.
O.
was to be appointed by the C.
C.
and was to work under its control.
The Rules provided for periodical Party conferences to discuss the most important aspects of Party life.
To the Central Committee were elected five Bolsheviks, four Mensheviks, two Polish Social-Democrats and one Latvian Social-Democrat; ten Bolsheviks, seven Mensheviks, three Polish and two Latvian Social-Democrats were elected alternate members.

As the C.

leadership could not be reliable, for it consisted of representatives of different trends (those of the non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations frequently vacillated between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks), a Bolshevik Centre headedby Lenin was elected at a sitting of the Bolshevik group towards the end of the Congress.
It included the Editorial Board of the newspaper Proletary.
The Fifth Congress marked a triumph for Bolshevism in the working-class movement of Russia.
Its decisions summed up the victory of Bolshevism over the opportunist, Menshevik wing of the Party during the bourgeois-democratic revolution.
The Bolshevik tactics was approved as the common one for the whole Party.

Medem) who was in the chair motioned a closure of the debate.
After Lenin’s speech at the following, fourth, sitting, the debate on the inclusion of the general theoretical questions in the agenda was continued.
At the fifth sitting on May 2 (15), the item “On the Attitude to the Bourgeois Parties” was included in the agenda.
p.
197 246Point 4 of the regulations adopted by the Congress provided for a name-ticket vote only when at least 20 delegates demanded one.
Lenin spoke in connection with the fact that a proposal had been made to the presidium of the Congress to have the roll-call vote without tickets.
By 3 votes to 2 the presidium came out against the tickets, but in view of the differences that arose, the question was referred to the Congress.
A majority (144) were in favour p.
197 of the name-ticket vote.
247Lieber’s amendment opened the attack by the Menshevik-Bundist opportunist section of the Congress against the Bolshevik resolution on the attitude to the bourgeois parties, which had been adopted as a basis.
Lieber motioned the deletion of the first part of the theoretical resolution: “At present, Social-Democracy is most insistently faced with the task of determining the class content of the various non-proletarian parties, of taking account of the present interrelation of classes and accordingly of defining its attitude to the other parties”.
Lieber’s amendment was reject-ed by the Congress.

248Lenin is replying to F.
I.
Dan, who objected to designating the Congress as the Fifth, as the Bolsheviks had proposed, on the plea that it was an effort to fix the factional dissensions.
Actually, however, the Mensheviks and the Bundists had ignored the Third,Bolshevik, Congress.
The Congress adopted the proposal of the Bundist Shanin (L.

Shapiro) to designate it as the “London Congress of the R.

199 249 The draft resolution of the Second Congress of the Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory, “On the Tasks of the Proletariat of the Current State of the Bourgeois-Democratic Revolution”, written by Lenin, was annexed, without debate, to the minutes of the Congress and published in No.
78 of the newspaper Zihña on July 7, 1907.
The minutes of the Congress have not been preserved.
The Second Congress of the Social-Democracy of the Latvian Ter-ritory was held in London from May 21 to 25 (June 3 to 7), 1907, just after the Fifth (London) Congress of the R.

P.
By then there were almost 13,000 organised Party members.
The Congress was attended by 26 delegates with vote and 10 with voice only.
The agenda was: 1) Reports of the Central Committee, of the Auditing Committee and local organisations.
2) Crises, lockouts and unemployment.
3) On the tasks of the proletariat at the pres-ent moment of the bourgeois-democratic revolution.
4) On agita-tion in the army.
5) On the trade unions.
6) On propaganda and agitation.
7) Organisational questions, etc.
The agrarian question had been removed from the agenda, evidence of the erroneous attitude of the Latvian Social-Democrats.
At the Congress there was a sharp struggle between the revolu-tionary Social-Democrats and the opportunists, especially on the C.
C.
report.
Lenin took an active part in the work of the Congress.
At the afternoon sitting on May 24 (June 6), 1907, he gave a report on the tasks of the proletariat at the present moment of the bourgeois-democratic revolution (there is a very bad record of the report— a retranslation from the Latvian into Russian made at the Police Department).
The Congress showed that Bolshevism had won strong positions in Latvia: it adopted Bolshevik decisions on the question of the trade unions, unemployment, and democratic and military organisations.
The Congress elected a new Central Committee, consisting in the main of revolutionary Social-Democrats, and authorised the C.
C.
to publish a manifesto “To the Latvian Proletariat”, drawn up in the Bolshevik spirit.
Zihña (Ciña) (Struggle)—the Central Organ of the Latvian Social-Democrats, founded in March 1904.
It was published illegally in Riga at big intervals until August 1909, and then abroad.
On the occasion of its hundredth issue in 1910, it carried an article by Lenin, “The Jubilee Number of Zihña”, giving a high appraisal of the revolutionary activity of the Latvian Social-Democrats (see present edition, Vol.
16, pp.
260-64).
The paper also carried a number of Party documents written by Lenin.
Among its con-stant and active contributors were P.
I.
Stu0ka, one of the organ-isers of the Communist Party of Latvia, and the popular poet J.
Rainis.
From April 1917, the newspaper was published legally in Pet-rograd, Riga and elsewhere, and from August 1919, when thecounter-revolution temporarily won out in Latvia, it was again published illegally in Riga.
After the establishment of the Soviet power in June 1940, the paper became the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Latvia and the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Republic.
p.
199 250 The International Socialist Congress at Stuttgart (the Seventh Congress of the Second International) was held from August 18 to 24, 1907.
The Congress was attended by 886 delegates representing social-ist parties and trade unions.
The German delegation was especially numerous (289 persons), most of them trade union officials, a fact which had a strong effect on the stand of the German Social-Democratic Party in the discussion and adoption of the Congress resolutions.
The delegation from Russia consisted of 37 Social-Democrats, 21 S.

The Congress examined the following questions: 1) Militarism and international conflicts.
2) Relations between political parties and trade unions.
3) Colonial question.
4) Immigration and emigra-tion of workers.
5) Women’s suffrage.
Lenin held several conferences of Bolshevik delegates to define their line in the Social-Democratic section, in the Russia delega-tion and at the Congress; he took part in the meetings of the Social-Democratic section, where he fought the opportunist line of the Mensheviks, and in the meetings of the Russia delegation, where he defended the R.

During the Congress, Lenin carried out a great deal of work in uniting the Left-wing forces in international Social-Democ-racy, resolutely fighting the opportunists and revisionists.
The conferences he organised with Left-wingers (Clara Zetkin, Rosa Luxemburg, Leon Tyszka, Georg Ledebour and others) were the first step in rallying the revolutionary Marxists.
The work of the Congress was concentrated in the committees, which drafted the resolutions for the Plenary Meetings.
Lenin took part in the work of the committee on “Militarism and International Conflicts”.
In the discussion of the draft resolution motioned by August Bebel, Lenin proposed amendments, which were supported by the Polish Social-Democrats, and secured a basic change in the draft in the spirit of revolutionary Marxism.
There was an acute struggle on the colonial question.
The oppor-tunist majority of the committee, headed by the Dutch “socialist” Van Kol, motioned an opportunist draft resolution which was supported by a majority of the German delegation.
The resolution on the colonial question adopted by the Congress denounced all colonial policy straightforwardly and without reservations.
The Congress adopted a resolution on the immigration and emi-gration of workers, which met the demands of the revolutionarySocial-Democrats, and of the internationalist education of workers in all countries.
Lenin attached great importance to the adoption by the Con-gress of a resolution on the relations between the trade unions and the political party of the working class.
In the committee Lenin’s line on the partisanship of the trade unions was supported by A.
V.
Lunacharsky.
On this question, contrary to the efforts of the Right wing, the Congress adopted a resolution confirming the principle of partisanship of the trade unions.

A translation of Clara Zetkin’s article “International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart” was edited by Lenin, who also supplied the notes, explaining the questions on which there had been a struggle against the opportunist section of the Congress delegates.
Clara Zetkin’s article was published in the Bolshevik miscellany Zarnitsy (Summer Lightning).

p.
209 258The Third Duma held five sessions from November 1 (14), 1907, to June 9 (22), 1912.
Elected on the basis of the June 3 electoral law the Third Duma was dominated by the Black Hundreds and the Octobrists, and was a pliant tool of the tsarist government in its counter-revolutionary policy of violence and repression against the revolutionary forces of Russia.
At the opening of the first session there were 11 parties and groups, including: Right-wing (extreme Right-wing, nationalist deputies; Octobrists—154; and moderate Right-wing)—147 Polish-Lithuanian-Byelorussian group—7; Polish kolo—11; Pro-gressive group—28; Moslem group—8; Cadets—54; Trudovik group—14; and Social-Democrats—19.
The Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma, despite the very difficult conditions, the small size of the group and some initial mistakes, did a great deal, thanks to the presence of the Bolshevik deputies, in exposing the anti-popular policy of the Third Duma, and in the political education of the proletariat and peasantry of Russia, through speeches in the Duma and work outside it.

209 259The Electoral Law of December 11 (4), 1905, on the convocation of a “legislative” Duma was issued by the tsarist government at the height of the Moscow armed uprising.

209 260Octobrists—members of the Octobrist Party (or the Union of Octo-ber Seventeen) formed in Russia after the issue of the tsar’s mani-festo of October 17 (30), 1905.
It was a counter-revolutionary party representing and fighting for the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landowners engaged in capitalist operations; it was headed by the well-known Moscow industrialist and real-estate man A.
I.
Guchkov and the big landowner M.
V.
Rodzyanko.

209 261Union of the Russian People—an ultra-reactionary, diehard organ-isation of monarchists, formed in St.
Petersburg in October 1905 to fight the revolutionary movement.
It had branches in many towns of Russia.
The Union wanted to preserve the autocracy, semi-feudal landed estates and privileges for the gentry.
“Orthodoxy, Autocracy National Character”, the nationalistic slogan of the serf period, was its programme slogan.
Its chief methods of fighting the revo-lution were pogroms and assassinations.
After the dispersal of the Second Duma, the Union broke up into two organisations: the Chamber of St.
Michael the Archan-gel, led by Purishkevich, which called for the use of the Third Duma for counter-revolutionary ends, and the Union of the Rus-sian People itself, led by Dubrovin, which continued the tactics of open terrorism.
Both outfits were liquidated during the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917.
After the October Socia-list Revolution, former members of these outfits took an active part in counter-revolutionary revolts and plots against the Soviet power.

P.
Central Committee was held at Geneva from August 11 to 13 (24 to 26), 1908, and was attended by 12 persons, five Bolsheviks (V.
I.
Lenin, I.
F.
Dubrovinsky and V.
K.
Taratuta among them), three Mensheviks, one Latvian Social-Democrat, one Polish Social-Democrat and two Bundists.
On the agenda were these questions: 1) report on the convocation of the Plenary Meeting; 2) all-Russia conference; 3) Central Bureau Abroad and promotion groups; 4) organisation of the Central Committee; 5) financial matters; 6) report of the C.
C.
to the Stutt-gart Congress; and 7) current business.
At the Plenary Meeting the Bolsheviks administered a resolute rebuff to the Menshevik efforts to do away with the Party’s Central Committee and to frustrate the convocation of a Party conference.
The Plenary Meeting adopted decisions on the main items of the agenda as motioned by the Bolsheviks.
On Lenin’s proposal, it was decided to start work right away on the convocation of a con-ference, whose agenda was outlined.
The Plenary Meeting adopted Bolshevik resolutions on the organisation of the Central Commit-tee and on the establishment of a Central Bureau Abroad, the latter being based on Lenin’s “Draft Resolution on the Organisa-tion of the Central Bureau Abroad” (pp.
217-18).
Lenin was elec-ted to the C.
O.
Editorial Board from the Bolsheviks.
The report on the convocation of the Plenary Meeting was dis-cussed together with the question of organising the Central Com-mittee, for it was learned during the debate that the Mensheviks had been in correspondence with the Bund and that they had actually proposed to liquidate the C.
C.
as the Party’s governing body under the pretext of “reorganising” it.
At the Plenary Meeting itself, the Mensheviks and the Bundists tried hard to cover up the fact.
It was in this connection that Lenin handed in his special “Statement on the Convocation of the C.
C.
Plenary Meeting” and motioned the “Draft Resolution on the Incident over the Convocation of the C.
C.
Plenary Meeting” which the Plenary Meeting adopted (pp.
216, 217).
After the Plenary Meeting, the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, started a broad campaign in preparation for an all-Russia Party con-ference.

to hold a special congress of these groups, which it failed to do in 1909 because of stubborn resistance from the Central Bureau of the promotion groups abroad, where the Menshevik liquidators were in control.

was to have five members, three of them representing the Central Committees of non-Russian national organisations.

S.
D.
L.
P.
was held in Paris from December 21 to 27, 1908 (January 3 to 9, 1909).
It was attended by 16 delegates with vote, among them five Bolsheviks, three Mensheviks, five Polish Social-Democrats and three Bund-ists.
On the agenda were the following questions: 1) Reports of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Central Committee, the Central Committee of the Polish Social-Democrats, the Bund Central Committee, the St.
Petersburg organisation, the Moscow, Central Industrial Region, Urals and Caucasian organisations.
2) The present political situation and the Party’s tasks.
3) The Social-Democrat-ic Duma group.
4) Organisational questions in connection with the changed political conditions.
5) Local mergers with non-Russian organisations.
6) Affairs abroad.
On every question, the Bolsheviks conducted a relentless struggle against the Menshevik liquidators and their supporters.
The Conference resolution “On the Reports” sharply condemned liquidationism as an opportunist trend and called for the most resolute ideological and organisation-al struggle against any attempts to liquidate the Party.
The work of the Conference was centred on Lenin’s report “On the Present Moment and the Tasks of the Party”.
The Mensheviks0 tried in vain to get the item on the agenda.
The Conference adopted the resolution motioned by Lenin with slight amendments (see present edition, Vol.
15, pp.
321-24).
The resolution “On the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma”, motioned by the Bolsheviks, criticised the activity of the group and stated its concrete tasks.
The Mensheviks objected to any indication of the Duma group’s mistakes in the Conference decisions and opposed the Central Committee’s right of veto in respect of the group.
The otzovists also came out against the Leninist line in respect of the Duma group.
The Conference adopted the Bolshevik resolution, whose text included a part of Lenin’s second variant of “Practical Instructions on Voting for the Budget by the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma” and all of his “Addendum to the Resolution on ‘The Social-Democratic Group in the Duma’” (see present edition, Vol.
15, pp.
326-27, 328).
During the discus-sion of the organisational question, the Bolsheviks proposed a draft resolution stating that the Party should devote special attention to the establishment and strengthening of illegal Party organisations, making use of an extensive network of diverse legal societies for work among the masses.
The Mensheviks were actually trying to liquidate the illegal Party and stop all revolu-tionary work.
In his speech on the organisational question, Lenin sharply criticised the resolution of the Menshevik liquidators and their attempts to justify those who had deserted from the Party in the years of reaction.
The Conference adopted Lenin’s “Direc-tives for the Committee on Questions of Organisation” (see present edition Vol.
15, p.
355) and set up a committee to draft a resolu-tion.
The committee, and then the Conference itself, adopted the Bolshevik draft resolution.
The Conference’s resolution on the local merger of national organisations resolutely rejected the principle of federalism, which the Bundists supported, as they wanted workers in the Party to be compartmentalised on national lines.
During the discussion of the Central Committee’s work, the Mensheviks proposed that its seat should be transferred to Russia and that the C.
C.
Bureau Abroad should be eliminated.
The liqui-dationist draft resolutions were rejected.
The Conference adopted a resolution recognising “the existence abroad of a general Party representative body in the form of the Central Committee Bureau Abroad as being useful and necessary”.
A Bolshevik resolution was adopted on the Central Organ; the Conference rejected the Menshevik proposal to have the publication of the C.
O.
transferred to Russia.
The Bolsheviks won a great victory at the Conference in their struggle against the Menshevik liquidators.
The Conference deci-sions also dealt a blow at the otzovists.
In the years of reaction, the Party was guided by the decisions of this Conference.
Lenin said that the Fifth All-Russia Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
“has led the Party out on to the road, and evidently marks a turning-point in the development of the Russian working-class movement after the victory of the counter-revolution” (see present edition, Vol.

p.
218 265On the strength of the short record of Lenin’s speech, it is impos-sible to say how fully his speech on the organisational question on December 24, 1908 (January 6, 1909) reflected all the questions listed in the outline, but these suggest that it may have been written during the debate on the organisational question.

p.
218 267Lenin made the statement at the Conference on December 24 1908 (January 6, 1909), after the slanderous statement by a member of the Caucasian delegation, the Menshevik N.
Ramishvili (Pyotr).
It became known at the Central Committee Plenary Meeting in August 1908 that the Menshevik liquidators had tried, even before the Plenary Meeting, to have the C.
C.
eliminated as the governing body of the Party and its activity confined to the func-tions of information.
The plan to eliminate the C.
C.
was set out in a letter addressed in June 1908 by B.
Gorev, a member of the C C.
, and A.
Martynov a member of the Golos Sotsial-Demokrata Editorial Board, “To All Menshevik Organisations”.
At the Plenary Meeting itself the Mensheviks tried hard to cover up their inten-tion to liquidate the C.
C.
(pp.
216-17).
The Bolsheviks exposed the disorganising, anti-Party activity of the liquidators.
The C.
C.
Plenary Meeting adopted Bolshevik draft resolutions on all the main items of the agenda.
At the Fifth All-Russia Conference members of the Golos Sotsial-Demokrata Editorial Board Dan and Axelrod and C.
C.
member N.

I.
Dan, L.

From its first issue, the paper stood up for the liquidators, justifying their anti-Party activity.
Following Plekhanov’s withdrawal from the Editorial Board over the paper’s liquida-tionist stand, it crystallised as the ideological centre of liquida-tionism.
p.
219 269Lenin entered his statement of fact at the last, ninth, sitting of the Conference on December 26, 1908 (January 8, 1909).
The minutes show that the sitting continued its discussion of the resolution on the Social-Democratic Duma group.
During the discussion of the point on budget voting, Lenin motioned his wording of this part of the resolution (see present edition, Vol.
15, pp.
326-27).
In the minutes there is an amendment by M.
N.
Lyadov proposing that the end of the resolution “and trade union organisations”should be worded as “after exchange of opinion with representatives of the trade unions”.
Lyadov said this was necessary because the draft resolution under discussion tended to narrow down the Central Committee’s powers.
Lenin opposed Lyadov’s amendment, saying that the C.
C.
had the right of veto in respect of the Social-Democratic Duma group.
Lyadov’s amendment was rejected.
The decision on the C.
C.
’s right of veto in respect of the Duma group was adopted at the same sitting.
It said that in view of its respon-sibility for the work of the group the C.
C.
must use its right of veto unhesitatingly “where the group’s decisions threaten to harm the Party”.
p.
220 270Lenin motioned the statement at the Conference on December 26, 1908 (January 8, 1909) during the discussion of the resolution on the Central Committee’s work.
The Menshevik liquidators had tried to liquidate the Central Committee as the Party’s governing body even before the Central Committee’s Plenary Meeting in August 1908.
Accordingly, Lenin motioned his “Statement on the Convocation of the C.
C.
Plenary Meeting” at the Plenary Meeting on August 12 (25), 1908 (p.
216).
The resolution “On the Incident over the Convocation of the C.
C.
Plenary Meeting” was adopted the following day on Lenin’s motion (p.
217).
p.
220 271The plan was written in 1908 or 1909, but the Institute of Marxism-Leninism has no direct information on those lectures.
Those who were there recall that Lenin read some lectures on philosophy in the Bolshevik circle in Paris in early 1909.
Mention of industry in 1907 is an indication that the plan was written later than 1907, since the statistical data for that year could not have been avai-lable before the beginning of the following one.
The reference to “present-day opportunists (Bogdanov)” in point 6 of the section “Philosophical Materialism” implies that the plan was written not earlier than the second half of March 1908, just when (not later than April 3 [16]) Lenin had sent to the press his article “Marxism and Revisionism”, in which he made his first press attack on Bogdanov for his opportunist, revisionist views in philosophy.
Almost all the points of the section “Philo-sophical Materialism” are reflected in his book “Materialism and Empirio-Criticism”; some points of the section “The Agrarian Question” are dealt with in his works on the agrarian question written in 1908.

The Conference discussed the following questions: otzovism and ultimatumism; god-building tendencies among Social-Democrats; attitude to the activity in the Duma among the other branches of Party work; the tasks of the Bolsheviks in the Party; the Party school being set up on Capri; unity of the group; the agitation for a Bol-shevik Congress or a Bolshevik conference separate from the Party; the split-away of A.
Bogdanov, and other questions.
Lenin gave detailed information on the state of affairs in the Party and the Bolshevik group.
His propositions became the basis of decisions adopted by the Conference.
The Conference resolutely condemned otzovism-ultimatumism as a harmful and dangerous trend within the working-class move-ment; it sharply criticised the philosophical views of the otzo-vists-ultimatumists, which were especially strikingly revealed in the idea of god-building.
Bogdanov, the leader and ideologist of the otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders, who had made an attempt on the unity of the Bolshevik group and had taken the way of revising Marxism and substituting for it an idealist, reactionary philosophy, was expelled from the Bolshevik group.
The Conference decisions were of great importance for the whole Party.
Lenin said that they gave great harmony and completeness to the political line which had been worked out by the Party in the years of reaction.

273The resolution motioned by Stanislav (“Yer”, S.
Volsky—A.

So-kolov) in the Moscow Committee expressed no confidence in the Editorial Board of Proletary and called for a Bolshevik conference to elect a new ideological centre.
The Moscow Committee rejected the resolution “by every vote except his own” (see present edition Vol.

The text of the resolution has not been discovered.

223 274Otzovists—representatives of an opportunist trend among the Bolsheviks.
Behind a screen of revolutionary talk, the otzovists (A.
Bogdanov, G.
A.
Alexinsky, A.
V.
Sokolov [S.
Volsky], A.
V.
Lunacharsky, M.
N.
Lyadov and others) demanded the recall of the Social-Democratic deputies from the Third Duma and an end to work in legal organisations.
They held that in the conditions of reaction the Party should conduct illegal activity only, and refused to participate in the Duma, in the workers’ trade unions, co-operatives and other mass legal and semi-legal organisations.
Ultimatumism was a variety of otzovism.
The ultimatumists differed from the otzovists only in form.
They proposed presenting the Social-Democratic Duma group with an ultimatum that it should implicitly submit to the Party Central Committee’s decisions and should be recalled from the Duma in the event of noncompliance.
Ultimatumism was in fact a camouflagedotzovism, and Lenin said the ultimatumists were “bashful otzo-vists”.
The otzovists were doing the Party a great deal of harm.
Their policy could lead to the Party’s separation from the masses and its transformation into a sectarian organisation incapable of muster-ing forces for another revolutionary upsurge.
Lenin exposed the otzovists as “liquidators inside out”, and declared a relentless fight against them.
He wrote: “Otzovism is not Bolshevism but the worst political travesty of Bolshevism its worst political enemy could invent” (see present edition, Vol.
15, p.
357).

223 275 The Third (Second All-Russia) Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
was held at Kotka, Finland, from July 21 to 23 (August 3 to 5), 1907.
It was attended by 26 delegates, nine of them Bolsheviks, five Men-sheviks, five Polish Social-Democrats, five Bundists and two Lat-vian Social-Democrats.
Among the delegates were V.
I.
Lenin, F.
E.
Dzerzhinsky, A.
V.
Lunacharsky and Rosa Luxemburg.
The Conference was also attended by members and alternate mem-bers of the Party Central Committee elected at the Fifth (London) Congress.
The need to call an urgent conference (two months after the Fifth Congress) was due to the changed political situation in view of the Third of June counter-revolutionary coup and the elections to the Third Duma.
On the agenda of the Conference were the following questions: participation in the elections to the Third Duma, electoral agreements with other parties, electoral platform and the All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions.
On the first question, the Conference heard three reports: Lenin’s (against a boycott) and A.
Bogdanov’s (for a boycott) from the Bolsheviks, and F.
Dan’s, from the Mensheviks and the Bund.
The Conference adopted as a basis Lenin’s draft resolution calling on the Party to take part in the electoral campaign and to struggle both against the Rightist parties and against the Cadets (see K.
P.
S.
S.
v rezolutsiyakh.
.
.
, Part I, pp.
173-74).
When their resolution was rejected, the Bolsheviks favouring a boycott voted for Lenin’s resolution.
The Conference decided that at the first stage of the elections, the Social-Democrats should not enter into any agreements with other parties, agreements being allowed on second and subsequent ballots with all parties left of the Cadets.
At the second and sub-sequent stages of the elections, agreements could be reached with all revolutionary and opposition parties to fight the Rightists.
But in the workers’ curia, the Social-Democrats were not to enter into agreements with other parties, with the exception of national Social-Democratic parties outside the R.

The Conference invited the Central Committee to draw up the electoral platform on the basis of its resolution on participa-tion in the elections to the Third Duma.
The Conference heard two reports on the All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions: one for the principle of the partisanship of the trade unions, and another, for the trade unions remaining neutral.
There were four draft resolutions on the reports (a Bolshevik, a Menshevik, and two compromise resolutions).
The Conference decided to refer themto the R.

The importance of the Third Conference lies in the fact that it marked out the principles of the Party’s tactics in the new histor-ical situation—the period of the Stolypin reaction.

(C.

)— the illegal newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat published from February 1908 to January 1917.
The first issue prepared by the Bolsheviks and partly printed by a private printer at Vilno was confiscated by the tsarist secret police.
Soon another attempt was made to publish the newspaper in St.
Petersburg.
The bulk of the printing likewise fell into the hands of the gendarmes.
Subsequently, the paper was published abroad: Nos.
2-32 (February 1909-December 1913) in Paris; Nos.
33-58 (November 1914-January 1917) in Geneva.
There were altogether 58 issues, of which five had supplements.
Lenin was the actual editor of the paper, and his articles were the centre-pieces of the newspaper.
More than 80 articles and items by p.
224 Lenin appeared in Sotsial-Demokrat.
277The pro-Party Mensheviks, headed by G.
V.
Plekhanov, opposed the liquidators in the years of reaction.
While retaining their Menshevik positions, the Plekhanovites wanted the illegal Party organisation preserved and strengthened, and on that point favoured a bloc with the Bolsheviks.
Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to move nearer to the pro-Party Mensheviks, saying that there could be an agreement with them on the basis of a struggle for the Party, and against the liquidators, “.
.
.
without any ideological compromises, without any glossing over of tactical and other differences of opin-ion within the limits of the Party line” (see present edition, Vol.
16, p.
101).
The pro-Party Mensheviks joined the Bolsheviks in working in the local Party committees, and contributed to Bolshevik publications.
At the end of 1911, Plekhanov broke up the bloc with the Bolsheviks.
On the pretext of fighting the “faction-alism” and the split within the R.
S.

Bogdanov’s speech in the debate on the report on otzovism and ultimatumism, which said that Rosa Luxem-burg had sharply condemned both.
In an effort to cast doubt on her criticism, Bogdanov recalled that in 1904 and 1905 Rosa Luxemburg had opposed the Bolsheviks.
p.
225 279The school was set up in 1909 on the isle of Capri, Italy, by the otzovists, ultimatumists and god-builders.
The conference of the enlarged Editorial Board of Proletary exposed the factional anti-Bolshevik character of the school, stating that its organisers were pursuing “not aims common to the Bolshevik wing as a whole, as an ideological trend in the Party, but the private aims of a group with a separate ideology and policy”.
The school was reso-lutely condemned as a “new centre being formed for a faction breaking away from the Bolsheviks” (see present edition, Vol.
15, p.
450).
It was opened in August.
Lectures were given by A.
Bogdanov, G.
Alexinsky, A.
Lunacharsky, Maxim Gorky, M.
N.
Lyadov M.
N.
Pokrovsky and V.
A.
Desnitsky.
Lenin rejected a formal invitation to go and lecture at the school.
In a letter to its stu-dents, who were insisting that he read them a series of lectures, Lenin said that he could not do so because the school had been “deliberately hidden away from the Party” in a “remote foreign spot” and was of a factional character.
He invited the students to come to Paris “to study Social-Democracy”, instead of the “separatist factional ‘science ’ ” of the otzovists and god-builders (see present edition, Vol.
15, pp.
472-78).
For a detailed history of the school and its characteristic, see Lenin’s articles “The Faction of Supporters of Otzovism and God-Building” and “A Shameful Fiasco” (present edition, Vol.

229287The First World Socialist Congress of the Second Interna-tional was held in Paris in July 1889.
Ideological guidance was provided by Frederick Engels.
There was acute political struggle between the Marxists and the anarchists, who repudiated political struggle.
The Congress decided on the need to strengthen the mass working-class movement and set up socialist parties for political struggle and the winning of power by the proletariat.
The Congress said that the ultimate aim of the labour movement was socialism and, despite anarchist protests, resolved to struggle for an eight-hour working day, higher wages, abolition of payments in kind, etc.
It also adopted the historic decision of celebrating May Day by staging demonstrations as a mark of proletarian solidarity.

231 288The International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen (Eighth Con-gress of the Second International) was held from August 28 to September 3, 1910.
It was attended by 896 delegates representing countries in Europe, North and South America, South Africa and Australia.
Russia like Austria, Britain, France and Germany, had 20 votes, of which the Social-Democrats (including the Lithuanian and Armenian Social-Democrats) had 10; the S.

Lenin was on the co-operative committee, one of the most important ones.
The resolution on the struggle against war—“Arbitration Courts and Disarmament”—confirmed the resolution of the Stuttgart Congress of 1907 on “Militarism and International Conflicts”, which included; the amendments motioned by Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg, calling on the socialists of all countries to make use of the economic and political crisis caused by war to over-throw the bourgeoisie.
The resolution of the Copenhagen Congress also bound the socialist parties and their representatives in par-liaments to demand that their governments reduce armaments, and settle conflicts between states through arbitration courts, and urged the workers of all countries to stage protests against the threat of war.
Lenin held a conference of Left-wing Social-Democrats attend-ing the Congress to rally the revolutionary Marxists in the inter-national arena.

Central Committee members living abroad was held in Paris from May 28 to June 4 (June 10 to 17), 1911.
It was prepared and called under Lenin’s direction apart from the Central Committee Bureau Abroad, whose liquidationist majority had repeatedly thwarted the convocation of a C.
C.
Plenary Meet-ing.
Preparations for the meeting began in April 1911.
It was to take measures to call a Plenary meeting of the Central Commit-tee and eliminate the grave crisis in which the Party found itself, being virtually without central governing bodies.
The meeting was attended by Bolsheviks, Polish and Latvian Social-Democrats one Golos man and one Bundist.
The Latvian Social-Democrat M.
V.
Ozolin announced that in accordance with a decision of his Central Committee he would attend the meeting with voice only.
The Bundist Lieber said that he had not been authorised by the Bund C.
C.
to represent it at the meeting.
In view of the forthcoming elections to the Fourth Duma, the meeting outlined measures to elaborate the Party’s tactics in the election campaign and draft an electoral platform.
The main item on the agenda was the calling of a Party conference.
Because it was impossible to call a Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee right away, the meeting undertook to call a conference, and set up an Organising Commission to prepare the conference.
The meet-ing adopted Lenin’s proposal to set up a Russian collegium for practical work in preparing the conference (see p.
240).
The meeting decisions provided for invitations to Party organisations abroad to work together on the Organising Commission.
Lenin, who voted for the resolution as a whole, lodged a protest against the invita-tion to the Organising Commission of representatives of anti-Party groups—the Golos and Vperyod followers (pp.
240-41).
The meeting condemned the anti-Party, factional policy of the Central Committee Bureau Abroad, and decided to refer the ques-tion of its existence to the C.
C.
Plenary Meeting.
In the voting on the last section of the resolution, Lenin abstained, because he insisted on an immediate reorganisation of the C.
C.
B.
A.
To handle technical matters (Party publishing, transportation, etc.
).
the meeting set up a Technical Commission which was to be respon-sible to the group of members and alternate members of the Central Committee attending the meeting.
A special bulletin issued after the meeting—”Announcement”— set out the circumstances in which the meeting had been called, its composition and purposes.
It also contained the resolutions of the meeting.
This meeting was an important step in mustering the Party forces, in uniting them for the struggle against the Golos liquida-tors, the Vperyod followers and the Trotskyites, and for strengthen-ing the Party.
Its decisions helped to rally and strengthen local Party organisations.
To prepare a general Party conference, Lenin sent to Russia experienced Party workers—the Bolsheviks G.
K.
Orjonikidze (Sergo), B.
A.
Breslav (Zakhar) and I.
I.
Shvarts (Semyon).
By September 1911, the meeting decisions were ap-proved by the committees and the Social-Democratic organisationsof a number of towns in Russia.
In September 1911, there was formed the Russian Organising Commission, consisting of repre-sentatives of a number of Social-Democratic organisations.
The Commission prepared the convocation in January 1912 of the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.

Central Committee, known as the “unity” meeting, was held in Paris from January 2 to 23 (January 15 to February 5), 1910.
It was attended by representatives of all factions and groups and of non-Russian Social-Democratic organisations.
The concil-iators had a majority at the meeting.
Lenin conducted a persist-ent struggle against the opportunists and conciliators to secure the condemnation of liquidationism and otzovism and to bring the Bolsheviks and the pro-Party Mensheviks closer together.
On the agenda were these questions: 1) Report by the Russian Bureau of the C.

2) Report by the C.

3) Report by the Editorial Board of the Central Organ.

Central Committee, etc.
On Lenin’s insistence, the Plenary Meeting adopted the reso-lution “On the State of Affairs in the Party”, which condemned liquidationism and otzovism, recognised the danger of these trends and urged the need to fight them.
Lenin said that the January Plenary Meeting finally determined the Party’s tactical line during the counter-revolutionary period, deciding, in pur-suance of the resolutions of the Fifth (All-Russia) Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(1908), that liquidationism and otzovism were manifestations of bourgeois influence on the proletariat.
The Ple-nary Meeting also connected the question of the need to have real Party unity, with the Party’s ideological and political tasks in the current historical period.
At the same time, Lenin sharply condemned the Plenary Meeting’s conciliatory decisions.

235 298The Fourth Duma opened on November 15 (28), 1912.
Elections were held in the autumn of 1912 under the reactionary electoral law of June 3 (16), 1907, and were accompanied by a series of government measures designed to create a Black-Hundred majority in the Duma.
Lenin described the election campaign and assessed the class and party composition of the Duma in his article “Results of the Elections” (see present edition, Vol.
18, pp.
493-518).
The Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma included six Bolsheviks—A.

K.
Muranov, G.
I.
Petrovsky, F.
N.
Samoilov, N.
R.
Shagov and R.
V.
Malinovsky (who later was exposed as a provocateur), seven Mensheviks and one member who did not enjoy full rights (the Warsaw deputy, E.
J.
Jagiello), and who sided with the Mensheviks.
Making use of their slight nu-merical superiority, the Mensheviks hampered the work of the groupand blocked the passage of a number of measures proposed by the Bolsheviks.
In October 1913, the Bolshevik deputies, on instructions from the Central Committee, withdrew from the united Social-Democratic group and formed their own.
Lenin gave day-to-day guidance to the Bolshevik deputies and taught them to make revolutionary use of the Duma rostrum.
The Duma proved to be incapable of settling any major questions which the country’s objective development brought up, and its work increasingly boiled down to wordy debate.
Its legislative activity was largely designed to strengthen such pillars of the autocracy as the courts, the church and the police.
The Duma approved Russia’s entry into the First World War.
The Mensheviks and the S.
R.
s took a defencist stand.
Only the Bolshevik Party resolutely opposed the war.
The Bolshevik group refused to vote the war credits and started revolutionary propa-ganda in the masses.
In November 1914, the Bolshevik deputies were arrested and committed for trial.
In August 1915, the bourgeois and landowner groups set up a “Progressive bloc”, consisting of more than one-half of the depu-ties.
Lenin said it was “the liberal-Octobrist bloc for the purpose of reaching an understanding with the tsar on a programme of reforms and mobilising industry for the victory over Germany” (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
378).
On February 26 (March 11) 1917, the tsar announced the disso-lution of the Fourth Duma, but, while not daring to protest openly the deputies decided to continue their sittings unofficially.
On February 27 (March 12) they formed a Provisional Committee of the Duma to fight the revolution and save the monarchy.
By agreement with the S.
R.
and Menshevik representatives of the Petrograd Soviet, the Committee decided to set up a bourgeois Provisional Government.
The Committee’s members were rabid enemies of the revolution, and at their private meetings demanded the establishment of a military dictatorship and the abolition of the Soviets.
On October 6 (19), 1917, under the pressure of the revolutionary masses, the bourgeois Provisional Government was forced to decree the dissolution of the Duma.

It was initially published as a weekly, twice a week from January 21 (February 3), 1912, and three times a week from March 8 (21), 1912.
Lenin gave ideological guidance to the newspaper: he carried on a correspondence with the members of the Editorial Board, directing their work, criticising their mistakes, especially in the initial period of its publication, struggling for the paper’s con-sistent Marxist approach.
A great deal of editorial and organisa-tional work was done by N.

p.
237 304The Central Committee Bureau in Russia was elected at a gener-al meeting of the Collegium of C.
C.
members, which was active in Russia from 1908.
The Bureau was in charge of all the affairs of the Russian Collegium in between general meetings of the C.
C.
In 1910 and 1911, after the January 1910 Plenary Meeting of the C.
C.
, the Bureau in Russia consisted of the following members and alternate members of the Central Committee: the Bolsheviks I.
P.
Goldenberg (Meshkovsky) and I.
F.
Dubrovinsky (Innokenty), and after their arrest, V.
P.
Nogin (Makar) and G.
D.
Leiteisen (Lindov).
The Menshevik liquidators, members and alternate members of the C.
C.
, kept aloof from its work, while I.
A.
Isuv (Mikhail), P.
A.
Bronstein (Yuri) and K.
M.
Yermolayev (Roman) not only refused to participate but declared that they considered the very existence of the C.
C.
to be harmful.
All the efforts of the Bureau to call the Russian Collegium failed.
In March 1911, following the arrest of Nogin and Leiteisen, the Central Committee Bureau in Russia ceased to exist.
Lenin gave a positive evaluation of the Russia Bureau’s efforts to orga-nise work in Russia and call the C.
C.
’s Russian Collegium, but sharply criticised the members’ conciliatory stand.
At the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.
S.

It consisted of C.

Spandaryan, J.
V.
Stalin and Y.
M.
Sverdlov, and alternate C.

members: M.

Stasova and others.
In view of frequent arrests of Party workers in Russia, the composition of the Bureau was subsequently changed many times, new members being co-opted in place of the old ones.
After the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917, the Bureau in Russia ceased to operate.

239 310The Organising Commission (Organising Commission Abroad, O.
C.
A.
) for convening a general Party conference was set up by the C.
C.
members’ meeting on June 1 (14), 1911, and consisted of Bolsheviks, conciliators and Polish Social-Democrats.
Other organisations and groups abroad invited to take part in the commis-sion did not send their representatives.
The O.
C.
sent G.
K.
Orjo-nikidze as its agent to Russia to work for the preparation of a gener-al Party conference, and issued an appeal “To All Social-Democrat-ic Party Organisations, Groups and Circles”, urging them to start elections to the Russian Organising Commission.
As a result of the work carried out by the Bolsheviks, the R.
O.
C.
was setup.
At the end of October, the O.
C.
A.
discussed the R.
O.
C.
’s “Announcement” of its constitution and resolutions stating that it assumed full powers in calling the conference and that the Organ-ising and Technical Commissions Abroad were to be subordinate to the R.
O.
C.
When the conciliatory majority of the O.
C.
A.
refused to abide by these decisions, the Bolsheviks left the O.
C.

On October 30 (November 12), Orjonikidze, who had arrived in Paris, gave a report in the O.
C.

on the activity of the R.
O.

after which the O.
C.

was forced to recognise the governing role of the R.

started an open struggle against the R.
O.
C.
On November 20 (December 3) it issued a leaflet, “Open Letter to the Russian Organising Commission”, accusing the latter of factional activity.
The O.
C.
A.
’s anti-Party activity was exposed by Orjonikidze in his “Letter to the Editorial Board ” carried in No.
25 of Sotsial-Demokrat on December 8 (21), 1911.
All the work of calling the general Party conference, held in January 1912, was carried out by the R.

241 315A reference to the Party school at Longjumeau, a few kilometres from Paris, set up by the Bolsheviks under Lenin’s guidance in the spring of 1911 for the workers of Party organisations of the major proletarian centres in Russia.
There were 13 students repre-senting Moscow, St.
Petersburg, Baku, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Nikolayev, Tiflis, Sormovo, Yekaterinoslav Gubernia, Dabrowa District (Poland) and 5 external students.
Among them were I.

The Mensheviks L.
Martov, F.

Dan and others declined, and most of the lecturers were Bolsheviks.
Lenin was the school’s ideological guide and its principal lecturer.
When two-thirds of the students had arrived, Lenin held classes on the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Fre-derick Engels.
Lenin read 29 lectures (43 hours) on political econ-p.
240 p.
241omy and 12 lectures (18 hours) on the agrarian question.
Under the initial plan, the lectures on philosophy were to be given by G.
V.
Plekhanov.
When it turned out that he was not coming after all, the students asked Lenin to give the lectures, and he read three on the materialist view of history.
Also at the students’ request, Lenin spoke on the present situation and the state of affairs in the Party.
After completing the course on August 17 (30), the students went back for illegal work in Russia.
They took an active part in preparing and holding the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.

242 317The proposal was motioned by Lenin at a meeting of Bolshevik groups abroad held in Paris on December 16 (29), 1911, when it was examining the question of whether there should be a detailed dis-cussion of the draft Rules of the Organisation Abroad at the meeting itself, or whether they should be referred to the Committee of the Organisation Abroad for co-ordination with the groups and final approval.
Lenin’s proposal was adopted by eight votes to one.
The meeting was held in Paris from December 14 to 17 (27 to 30), 1911, under Lenin’s direction.
It was called on the initiative of the Paris circle for the promotion of the Bolshevik Rabochaya Gazeta, and was aimed at uniting the Bolshevik forces abroad and pro-moting the convocation of an all-Russia Party conference.
It was attended by 11 delegates with vote from the Bolshevik groups of Paris, Nancy, Zurich, Davos, Geneva, Liége, Berne, Bremen and Berlin.
The Bolsheviks of Toulouse, Lausanne, London, Brussels, Antwerp, Copenhagen, Nice and other cities were unable to send their representatives for technical and financial reasons.
Some Bolshevik groups managed to send in detailed reports.
On the agenda were these items: 1) reports of the Organising Bureau and delegates from the localities; 2) the state of affairs in the Party; 3) the state of affairs abroad and attitude to the various trends; 4) organisational matters; 5) the tasks of work abroad; 6) attitude to the conference; 7) other matters.
The meeting declared the final break-away of the Golos and Vperyod supporters from the Party, their complete bankruptcy, and approved the measures of the June meeting of the C.
C.
mem-bers on convening a Party conference.
The meeting adopted the resolution motioned by Lenin on support for the Russian Organising Commission and the conference it was trying to call, and resolved to set up the R.

With Gurko’s help, Lidval concluded a deal with the government to supply 10 million poods of rye to the famine-stricken gubernias of Russia from October to December 1906.
Having received a sizable advance through Gurko from the treasury, Lidval brought up less than 10 per cent of the total quantity of grain to the railway lines by mid-December 1906.
This embezzlement and speculation on the famine were exposed and widely reported, forcing the tsarist government to institute legal proceedings.
But apart from being removed from his post, Gurko was not punished in any way.

Petersburg at a meeting in Vitmer’s private school.
The pupils were suspected by the secret police of belonging to an illegal circle.
The question was discussed at the 12th 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th sittings of the Duma.
On February 6 (19), 1913, a majority adopted a formula to proceed with the business of the Duma, recognising the Mini-ster’s explanations as being unsatisfactory.

It had the actual impor-tance of a congress and was directed by Lenin.
He gave reportson the present situation and the Party’s tasks, on the work of the International Socialist Bureau, and also spoke on other questions.
Lenin drafted resolutions on all the important items of the agenda.
Of tremendous theoretical and practical importance were the Conference resolutions on “Liquidationism and the Group of Liquidators” and “The Party Organisation Abroad”.
The Con-ference declared that by their behaviour the liquidators had finally placed themselves outside the Party, and expelled them from the R.
S.

The Conference condemned the activity of anti-Party groups abroad: the Mensheviks supporting Golos, the Vperyod group and the Trotskyites.
It recognised as absolutely necessary the existence of a single Party organisation abroad working under the supervision and direction of the Central Committee to promote the Party, and said that the groups abroad which “refuse to sub-mit to the Russian centre of Social-Democratic work, i.

played an outstanding part in building up the Bolshevik Party, a new type of party, and in strengthening its unity.
It summed up the results of a whole historical period of the Bolshevik struggle against the Mensheviks, and by expelling the Menshevik liquidators from the Party, con-solidated the Bolshevik victory; the Conference laid down the Party’s political line and tactics in the conditions of the fresh revolutionary upsurge.
The Prague Conference was of great international importance.
It showed the revolutionary elements of the parties in the Second International an example of resolute struggle against opportunism, taking the struggle to a complete break with the opportunists.

247 328A reference to the walk-out from the Magdeburg Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party, held from September 18 to 24, 1910, of the Social-Democratic deputies of the Baden Landtag.
The Social-Democratic group of the Baden Landtag voted for the government budget despite the decisions of earlier party congresses which prohibited Social-Democratic deputies from voting for the bourgeois government’s budget.
By an overwhelming majority of 289 votes to 80, the Magdeburg Congress condemned the oppor-tunist tactics of the Baden Social-Democrats.
The latter then announced that they would reserve the right not to submit to Congress decisions.
In response, the majority of the Congress adopted a special resolution immediately expelling from the Party anyone violating the Congress decision on budget voting.
Before the resolution was adopted, the Baden deputies staged a walk-out.
For details about the Magdeburg Congress see Lenin’s article p.
247 “Two Worlds” (present edition, Vol.

329A reference to the differences between the Czech and Austrian Social-Democrats over trade union unity.
At the Extraordinary Congress of Austrian Trade Unions in December 1905, the Czech Social-Democrats demanded the establishment of national trade unions with jurisdiction extending over the whole of Austria.
The proposal was rejected by a vast majority, but the Czechs refused to submit to the Congress decision.
In 1910, the Austrian Social-Democrats took the matter to the International Socialist Congress at Copenhagen, which rejected the separatist Czech proposal and came out unanimously for trade union unity.

p.
250 332A reference to the illegal Social-Democratic Party of Germany during the period of the Anti-Socialist Law introduced by the Bismarck government in 1878 to fight the working-class and social-ist movement.
The law banned all organisations of the Social-Democratic Party, mass workers’ organisations and the labour press; socialist literature was confiscated, the Social-Democrats were harassed and exiled.
But the Social-Democratic Party prevailed in the face of these persecutions, and reorganised its activity to meet the illegal conditions; its Central Organ, the newspaper Sozial-Demokrat, was published abroad and party congresses met regularly (1880, 1883 and 1887) outside the country; in the underground in Germany, the Social-Democratic organisa-tions and groups were being rapidly revived under the leadership of an illegal C.
C.
At the same time, the party made wide use of legal opportunities to strengthen its ties with the masses, and its influence continued to grow: the number of votes it won at the Reichstag elections in 1890 was more than three times greater than in 1878.
The German Social-Democrats received great assist-ance from Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.
In 1890, the Anti-Socialist Law was abolished under pressure from the massive and p.
252.
ever growing working-class movement.
333The plan was printed in the text of an announcement issued by the Paris section of the R.

Organisation Abroad.
It said: Comrade L e n i n will give a lecture on the “Revolutionary Upsurge of the Russian Proletariat” at Alcazar Hall 190 Avenue de Choisy on Thursday, June 13, 1912.
The questions listed in the plan are dealt with in a number of Lenin’s works written in 1912, especially in his article “Revolu-tionary Upswing” (see present edition, Vol.
18, pp.
102-09).
The text of the announcement was reproduced in the journal Istorichesky Arkhiv (Historical Archives) No.

p.
254 334 A reference to the fusillade of unarmed workers at the Lena gold mines in Siberia on April 4 (17), 1912.
News of the tragedy aroused the working class of Russia, and the country was swept by demon-strations, meetings and protest strikes.
The Social-Democratic group in the Duma tabled a question to the tsarist government over the Lena fusillade.
The tsarist Minister Maklakov have this brazen reply: “That’s how it was, and that’s how it will be in the future!” This intensified the indignation of the workers.
Up to 300,000 workers took part in the protest strikes against the Lena fusillade, and they merged with the May Day strikes involvingup to 400,000 workers.
Lenin wrote: “The Lena shootings led to the revolutionary temper of the masses developing into a revo-lutionary upswing of the masses” (see present edition, Vol.
18, p.
103).
p.
254 335The article, written in September 1912, dealt with the state of affairs in the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania, which was split.
One section consisted of those who supported the Party’s Chief Executive headed by Rosa Luxem-burg and J.
Tyszka—the so-called “Zarzadists”.
On the whole, the Chief Executive took an internationalist stand and waged a struggle in Poland against nationalism and reformism, but followed an erroneous line on the struggle within the R.
S.

P.
, taking a conciliatory attitude to the Menshevik liquidators; it tended to detach itself from the general Party life and weakened contacts with the R.

S.
D.
L.
P.
In the struggle against the mistakes of the Chief Executive, there took shape an opposition represented by the so-called “Rozla-mists”, who relied on the Party’s Warsaw organisation headed by former members of the Chief Executive J.
Hanecki, A.
Malecki and others.
Rozlamists were in close contact with the Bolsheviks and supported their action.
Lenin said that in that period the Warsaw organisation was the strongest and most consistently revolutionary of all the organisations of the Polish Social-Democrats (see Lenin’s article “The Split Among the Polish Social-Democrats”, Vol.
18, pp.
479-83).
The article was aimed against the erroneous line of the Chief Executive, which objectively inflicted grave harm on the unity of the working-class movement in Russia as a whole and played into the hands of the anti-Bolshevik trends in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
While criticising the grave errors of Rosa Luxemburg and J.
Tyszka, Lenin put a great value on their activity and tried to help them to take a correct stand.
Lenin was known to regard Rosa Luxemburg as an outstanding leader of the Polish, German and the entire international working-class movement.
He wrote later that for all her mistakes, Rosa Luxemburg was “an eagle” and that “Communists all over the world cherish her memory” (see present edition, Vol.
33, p.
210).
The article was written for the Bremer Bürger-Zeitung which was under the influence of the Left-wing Social-Democrats; it was translated into German by Malecki (see Lenin, Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol.
48, Document 72).
The article was not published.
p.
255 336A reference to the charge against Karl Radek that he had committed a number of unethical acts.
This was levelled by a Party court set up by the Chief Executive of the Social-Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania.
By a decision of the court Radek was expelled from the ranks of the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania.
A commission to review the court’s decision was set up in Paris in early September 1913 on the initiative of the Bureau of the sections of the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania abroad (Rozlamists).
Lenin supported the review of the Radek case, for he believed that the charge against Radek was the outcome of the sharp struggle which the Chief Executive was waging against the Rozlamists.
The commission worked for five months and arrived at the conclusion that there had been no ground for committing Radek to trial by a Party court and expelling him from the Party.
It proposed that Radek should be considered a member of the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and of the R.

On the pages of the paper, the liquidators attacked the revolutionary tactics of the Bolsheviks, preached the opportunist slogan of setting up a so-called “open party”, opposed revolutionary mass strikes by workers and tried to revise the key propositions of the Party Programme.

262 347The First Balkan War (October 191-May 1913) was fought between Turkey and the countries of the Balkan alliance—Bulgaria, Ser-bia, Montenegro and Greece.
It ended in the defeat of Turkey, which under the London Peace Treaty lost almost all her Balkan possessions.
The Slav regions, Macedonia and Thrace, were liber-ated; the Albanian people won national independence.
The First Balkan War, despite the fact that the monarchy and the bourgeoisie of the Balkan countries pursued their own dynastic and plunderous aims, was on the whole progressive—it marked the liberation of the Balkan people from the Turkish yoke and dealt a blow at the survivals of the serf system.
Lenin said it was “one link in the chain of world events marking the collapse of the medieval state of affairs in Asia and Eastern Europe” (see present edition, Vol.

It had good news coverage and was Russia’s first paper to send its own correspondents to all the major cities of Russia and many world capitals.
In November 1917, the paper was closed down for running slanderous anti-Soviet reports.

The Bolshevik deputies to the Fourth Duma took an active part in the paper.
Some of Maxim Gorky’s writings were published in Pravda.
The paper was constantly harassed by the police; it was closed down by the tsarist government eight times, but continued to appear under other names: Rabochaya Pravda, Severnaya Pravda, Pravda Truda, Za Pravdu, Proletarskaya Pravda, Put Pravdy, Rabochy and Trudovaya Pravda.
In these difficult conditions, the Bolsheviks managed to put out 636 issues in the course of over two years.
On July 8 (21), 1914, the paper was closed down.
It was resumed only after the bourgeois-democratic revolution in February 1917.

It was published as Listok Pravdy, Proletary, Rabochy andRabochy Put.

During the First World War, the Progressists stepped up their activity, demanding a change of military com-mand, mobilisation of industry for the needs of the front, and a “responsible ministry” with the participation of representatives of the Russian bourgeoisie.
After the bourgeois-democratic revo-lution in February 1917, some of the party’s leaders took part in the bourgeois Provisional Government.

in April 1905.
In view of the small number of participants (only delegates from nine committees) the Mensheviks declared it to be a conference of Party functionaries.
Its decisions showed that the Mensheviks did not set themselves the task of carrying forward the revolution.
They denied the hegem-ony of the proletariat in the revolution and the policy of alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry.
They believed the liberal bourgeoisie to be the leader in the bourgeois-democratic revolution, which was to take over after the revolution won out.
The Mensheviks denied the need for a provisional revolutionary government and participation of Social-Democrats in it.
In its decisions on an armed uprising, the conference failed to set out the practical tasks facing the proletariat.
The Mensheviks believed that the proletarian party should not take part in preparing the uprising for fear of scaring off the bourgeoisie.
The conference came out against Social-Democratic participation in a provisional revolutionary government.
It did not set the task of organising revolutionary peasant committees to seize the landed estates, leaving the solution of the agrarian problem to a future Constituent Assembly.
The conference decisions on the organisational ques-tion, expressed in the “organisational Rules”, dragged the Party back from the Second Congress to organisational fragmentation and clannishness.
Lenin exposed the opportunist character of these decisions and subjected them to withering criticism in his article “A Third Step Back”, his work Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, and in the “Preface to the Pam-phlet Workers on the Split in the Party” (see present edition, p.

In view of the intensified persecution of the workers’ press by the tsarist government at the start of the First World War, Priboi had to cease its activity and resumed it only in March 1917.

A Party commission consisting of representatives of the Editorial Boards of the news-paper Za Pravdu and the journals Prosveshcheniye and Voprosy Strakhovaniya, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma, and Priboi Publishers examined the facts and established that after joining the Bolshevik Party Dansky had ceased writing for the bourgeois press; accordingly, it declared him to be an honest Party member, and the liquidators’ charges, libellous.

296 372For reasons of secrecy this was called a summer conference but actually it was held from September 23 to October 1 (October 6 to 14), 1913, in the village of Poronin, near Cracow, where Lenin then lived.
On its agenda were the following questions: 1) reports from the localities, report on the work of the Social-Democracy of Poland and Lithuania, report on the work of the C.
C.
elected0 at the Prague Conference; 2) the tasks of agitation at the present moment; 3) organisational question and the Party congress; 4) strike movement; 5) Party press; 6) Social-Democratic work in the Duma; 7) Social-Democratic Duma group; 8) work in legal societies; 9) national question; 10) Narodniks; 11) the forthcoming International Socialist Congress (in Vienna).
Lenin directed the Conference.
He delivered the opening speech, gave the report on the work of the Central Committee, the report on the national question, and on the forthcoming International Socialist Congress in Vienna.
He also spoke on almost all the questions of the agenda, kept a record of speeches by delegates from local Party organisa-tions, motioned proposals, drafted and edited resolutions.
The text of the report on the work of the C.
C.
has not been discovered.
A brief summary of some points from the report is given in A.
Y.
Badayev’s reminiscences.
Two resolutions, written by Lenin, were adopted on the C.
C.
report and the reports from the localities: “The Tasks of Agita-tion in the Present Situation” and “On the Organisational Question and on the Party Congress”, which determined the Party ’ s tasks and the main forms of Party work in the new historical conditions.
One of the main questions at the Conference was the national question, which at the time was among the most prominent in Russia’s social life.
In his report on the national question, Lenin emphasised that the struggle against national oppression was indissolubly bound up with the struggle against tsarism, for freedom and democracy.
The Conference, on the strength of the Party Programme, resolutely rejected the opportunist demand of the Mensheviks and the Bundists for “cultural-national auton-omy” and adopted the propositions on the national question worked out by Lenin.
He regarded the resolution on the national question as a declaration of the Party Programme on this issue.
The Conference decided to include the quotation of a national programme on the agenda of the next Party congress.
In its resolution on the Social-Democratic Duma group, the Conference demanded equality for the Bolshevik and the Menshevik sections and resolutely condemned the actions of the Menshevik section, which made use of its chance majority of one vote and was violating the elementary rights of the Bolshevik deputies, who represented the vast majority of Russia’s workers.
On instruc-tions from Lenin and the C.
C.
of the Bolshevik Party, the Bolshe-vik deputies left the joint Social-Democratic group in the Duma in October 1913 and set up their own Bolshevik group (the Rus-sian Social-Democratic Labour group).
In his report on the International Socialist Congress, which was to be held in Vienna in 1914, Lenin proposed that as many dele-gates as possible should be sent from the illegal and legal organi-sations, for it was intended to hold a Party congress simultaneously with the International Socialist Congress.
Lenin delivered the summing-up speech.
In view of the impor-tance of the questions discussed and the decisions adopted, the Poronin Conference had the significance of a Party conference.
The minutes of the Conference have not been found.
The announce-ment of the Conference and the resolutions it adopted were published in a separate pamphlet abroad as a Central Committee publication (Izveshcheniye i rezolutsii letnego 1913 goda soveshcha-niya Tsentralnogo Komiteta R.

The full text of the resolutions was printed in an illegal hecto-graphed publication.
There are police department records of the Conference, of which the details were supplied by the provocateurs Malinovsky and Lobov.

Lenin sent an outline of the report to be made in the localities to St.

The outline was drawn up for the Bolshevik deputies of the Fourth Duma, as a guide for their reports about the Conference to be made to local Party workers during the Christmas recess.

298 374The December session of the International Socialist Bureau was held in London on December 13 and 14, 1913, and discussed the unification of the British socialist and labour parties, the Vienna Congress, Russian affairs, etc.
The question of uniting the Social-Democratic Party in Russia was brought up for debate just before the session closed.
In view of the late hour, the question was not discussed in detail, and the Bureau confined itself to adopting a resolution motioned by Kautsky on behalf of the German dele-gation.
It authorised the Executive Committee of the I.
S.
B.
to call a conference of representatives of “all the factions of the working-class movement in Russia, including Russian Poland, who accept the Party Programme or whose programmes are in accord with the Social-Democratic Programme, for an exchange of opinion (Aussprache) over the issues on which they are divided”.
Motivating the resolution, Kautsky said on December 1 (14) that the old Social-Democratic Party in Russia was dead.
It was necessary to revive it, relying on the Russian workers’ desire for unity.
In his article “A Good Resolution and a Bad Speech”, Lenin analysed the content of the resolution and said Kautsky’s speech was a monstrous one (see present edition, Vol.
19, pp.
528-30).
Writing to Inessa Armand of the issue of Vorwärts which carriedKautsky’s statement, Lenin said: “You should get hold of it .

In a letter to the Bolshevik section in Paris, Lenin wrote: “It is most desirable that the section should adopt a s l a s h i n g reso-lution against Kautsky (calling his statement about the Party’s death shameless, brazen, monstrous, ignorant)” (Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol.
48, p.
254).

decision, the leaders of the Second International, on the pretext of “reconciling” the Bolsheviks and the liquidators, demanded that the Bolsheviks should stop criticising the latter.
The Bolshe-viks refused to do so and continued their relentless struggle against the liquidators, who were enemies of the labour movement.
p.
299 375Lenin wrote the article in connection with the All-Russia Congress on Public Education which was to be held in St.
Petersburg during the winter holidays at the end of December 1913.
The Bolsheviks wanted to use the Congress as a legal opportunity for spreading Bolshevik ideas and revolutionary demands.
The article is closely connected with Lenin’s “The Question of Ministry of Education p.
300 Policy” (see present edition, Vol.
19, pp.
137-46).
376The question of the Vienna congress was discussed by the Interna-tional Socialist Bureau in December 1913.
It was decided to call the Congress in August 1914, timing it to coincide with the celebra-tions of the 50th anniversary of the First International.
The follow-ing questions were entered on its agenda: 1) high cost of living; 2) imperialism and the struggle against militarism, which included as subquestions: a) the Eastern question; b) compulsory courts of arbitration between nations and c) United States of Europe; 3) alcoholism; 4) unemployment; 5) condition of political prisoners and exiles in Russia; and 6) miscellaneous.
No country was to have a delegation numbering more than six times the number of its votes; hence, Russia, with 20 votes, could have no more than 120 delegates for both subsections of the Social-Democrats and the Left Narodniks and the trade unions together.
The question of the International Socialist Congress in Vienna was discussed at the Poronin Conference of the C.
C.
with Party functionaries.
Lenin, reporting on the question, proposed that all measures should be taken to have Social-Democratic workers in a majority as delegates to the Vienna Congress.
By the end of July 1914, the elections to the International Socialist Congresswere almost completed, but the outbreak of the world war pre-vented the Congress from being held.

The demand for special representation for the Six was not at all presented to the Bureau for purely formal reasons; this shows that N.

In the Roman Empire, the Jews lived in communities, sometimes forming public-law corporations (as in Alexandria), or private religious societies (as in Rome).

and to the split in the Duma group, and took part in conferences of Bolshevik delegates, helping them to draft resolutions.
On the eve of the Congress, January 12 (25), Lenin gave a lecture for the delegates on the national ques-tion, setting out the relevant Bolshevik theory and tactics.
Lenin urged the Marxists of Latvia to strengthen the Party’s real—instead of imaginary—unity and keep its ranks clean of vacillators and liquidators, who were patent traitors to the working-class cause.
He made wide we of the resolutions of the Fourth Congress to fight the liquidators and Trotskyites.
See his articles “The Lettish Workers and the Split in the Social-Democratic Group in the Duma”, “The ‘August’ Fiction Exposed”, “The Liquidators and the Lettish Working-Class Movement” (see present edition, Vol.
20, pp.
177-81, 182-85, 239-41) and others.
Thanks to the persistent struggle against the conciliatory tendencies conducted by Lenin and the Latvian Bolsheviks at the Congress, the Latvian Social-Democrats withdrew from the August bloc, and this, Lenin said, was a “death blow” at the Trotskyite association.
The minutes of the Congress have not been discovered, but it is known that they were prepared for publication by Janson-Braun and were left in Brussels.
At the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Of great interest are Lenin’s notes on the speeches and his commentaries.
There is, for instance, a note on Braun’s speechon January 15 (28), 1914.
Where Braun says, in justification of his conciliatory stand, that it is “a very fine point”, Lenin writes: “That’s where it’s liable to break!” p.
324 386A reference to the liquidators’ conference held in Vienna in August 1912; it formalised the anti-Party August bloc, which was organ-ised by Trotsky.
It was attended by representatives of the Bund, the Transcaucasian Regional Committee, the Social-Democracy of the Latvian Territory and groups of liquidators, Trotskyites and otzovists abroad (the Editorial Boards of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata and Trotsky’s Vienna Pravda, and the Vperyod group).
Delegates from Russia were sent by the St.
Petersburg and Moscow “initiating groups” of liquidators, the Krasnoyarsk organisation, the Sebastopol Social-Democratic Military Organi-sation, the Editorial Boards of the liquidators’ publications, Nasha Zarya and Nevsky Golos; it was also attended by a represen-tative of the Spilka Committee Abroad.
The overwhelming majority were resident abroad, were out of touch with the working class in Russia, and not connected directly with local Party work in Russia.
The conference adopted anti-Party, liquidationist decisions on all questions of Social-Democratic tactics and came out against the existence of the illegal Party.
The liquidators’ attempt to set up their own, Centrist party in Russia was not supported by the workers.
The liquidators failed to elect a Central Committee and confined themselves to setting up an Organising Committee.
The anti-Bolshevik bloc, consisting of diverse elements, which it was the main task of the conference to set up, began to fall apart before the conference was over.
See Lenin’s articles “The Break-up of the ‘August’ Bloc”, “The ‘August’ Fiction Exposed”, “Disrup-tion of Unity Under Cover of Outcries for Unity” (present edition, Vol.

326 387The Resolution on Setting up an Organisational Section of the Central Committee to direct illegal Work was adopted by the C.

at its sittings held in Cracow from April 2 to 4 (15 to 17), 1914, under Lenin’s direction and with the participation of G.

In connection with the discussion of the question of setting up the Organisational Section of the Central Committee to direct illegal Work and the adoption of a resolution on this question, Lenin proposed that prominent Party workers—among them M.

Kalinin and A.

Kiselyov—and workers who took an active part in the insurance movement should be included in the Section.

to the Vienna Congress of the Second International” (see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected p.
330 Works, Vol.

388The Party congress was to be timed to coincide with the Interna-tional Socialist Congress in Vienna, set for August 1914.
An Organ-ising Commission was set up under the Russian Collegium of the C.
C.
to prepare for the congress.
It was also decided to set up com-missions in Moscow, the Caucasus, the South and the Urals.
The congress was to be preceded by organisational tours of local Party organisations by C.
C.
agents, and also by trips to the localities of the Bolshevik deputies to the Duma.
The preparations for the congress were especially intensive in the spring and summer of 1914.
The agenda and even the composition of the congress were determined.
It was to discuss the following questions: reports of the C.
C.
and reports from the localities, the political situation, the Party’s organisational tasks, the tasks of the strike movement, the tactics of the insurance movement, some addenda to the minimum programme, the national question, the liquidators in connection with the conference under the I.
S.
B.
, participation in the bourgeois press and other urgent problems of the time.
By the end of July 1914, preparations for the congress and elections to the International Socialist Congress were almost complete.
Most of the delegates were elected, the instructions drawn up and the mandates collected.
The technical side—secret meeting places, routes and passports—was also ready.
But the outbreak of war and the wild reaction that followed worked a sharp change in the situa-tion in the country.
The closure of the frontiers cut off commun-ications with all other countries.
The congress was postponed until a more favourable moment.
Nor was the International Congress able to meet in these circumstances.
Although the Party congress did not take place, preparation for it had a great part to play in strengthening and consolidating the Party organisations.

331 389The statistical studies by I.
M.
Kozminykh-Lanin repeatedly drew Lenin’s attention.
In August 1912, Lenin wrote two reviews on his Working Day and Working Year in Moscow Gubernia, entitled “The Working Day in the Factories of Moscow Gubernia” and “The Working Day and Working Year in Moscow Gubernia”.
The first was published in Pravda, the second in Nevskaya Zvezda in August 1912 (see present edition, Vol.
18, pp.
260-61, 262-69).
Lenin used the author’s statistical data in his article “The Language of Figures”, published in September 1913 in the Moscow newspaper Nash Put (see present edition, Vol.
19, pp.
358-63).
In the first of the above-mentioned reviews Lenin wrote that the statistician had prepared a special work on overtime at Moscow Gubernia factories, and the article given here is a review of this latter work, which was published in 1914.

D.
L.
P.
C.
C.
consisted of Inessa Armand (Petrova), M.
F.
Vladimirsky (Kamsky) and I.
F.
Popov (Pavlov).
Lenin thoroughly prepared the delegation for the conference: he wrote a report and detailed instructions for it, provided it with the necessary material, documents and factual data which exposed the true face of Russia’s opportunists and their sponsors.
From the outset there was a sharp struggle between the Bol-sheviks and the Russian and international opportunists.
On Kautsky’s motion, the conference approved the following agenda: 1) Programme differences.
2) Tactical differences.
3) Organisa-tional question.
Despite the fact that the conference was to be limited to an exchange of opinion, Vandervelde warned that it would adopt decisions on all three items of the agenda.
The C.
C.
delegation, guided by Lenin’s instructions, motioned that the conference should hear the delegations’ reports and suggestions concerning the concrete conditions which each considered necessary to ensure unity.
Thanks to the insistence of the Bolsheviks it was decided to depart from the adopted agenda and to go on to reports on the controversial questions and to the formulations of the concrete conditions for unity.
At the centre of the conference’s work was a report of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
C.
C.
, prepared by Lenin and read out by Inessa Armand in French at the morning sitting of July 17.
The leaders of the I.
S.
B.
did not allow her to read out the entire report, so she had to summarise a part of it and then go on to stating the terms for unity.
Intent on defending the liquidators, the I.
S.
B.
leaders were greatly irritated at the concrete proposals of the Bolsheviks on the terms for unity.
On behalf of the I.
S.
B.
, Kautsky motioned a resolution which asserted that there were no essential differences among the Russian Social-Democrats hindering their unity.
He was supported by the O.
C.
and Plekhanov, who made fierce attacks against the C.
C.
delegation and Lenin.
An erroneous stand was taken by Rosa Luxemburg, who joined Plekhanov, Vandervelde, Kautsky and others in urging a union of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
Since the motioning of the resolution was outside the powers of the conference, the Bolsheviks and the Latvian Social-Democrats refused to participate in the vote on it.
But a majority adopted the resolution.
The Polish opposition, although it supported the Bolsheviks and the Latvian Social-Democrats at the conference, voted for the I.
S.
B.
resolution.
(See Lenin’s article “The Polish Social-Democratic Opposition at the Parting of the Ways”, present edition, Vol.
20, pp.
556-57.
) The Bolsheviks, guided by Lenin, refused to abide by the deci-sions of the Brussels conference.
The attempt on the part of the opportunist leaders of the Second International to liquidate the Bolshevik Party was a failure.
In the face of the international proletariat, Lenin and the Bolsheviks exposed the true aims of the leaders of the International parading as peace-makers.
At a private conference of liquidators, Trotskyites, Vperyod supporters, Plekhanovites, Bundists and representatives of the Caucasian Regional Organisation, held after the Brussels confer-ence, these groups set up a bloc against the Bolsheviks.
The Brus-sels (July Third) bloc was a hypocritical cover-up for the politi-cally rotten positions of all its participants; the bloc’s break-up soon after showed the falsity of the policy propounded by the p.

391The item was intended for the newspaper Trudovaya Pravda.
In the margin of the page on which it is written, Lenin made a note for the editors: “Set this thing in brevier, and do not print any replies to their letters, nothing at all: let them all go to their new ‘brothers by bloc’”.
The item was not published as the newspaper was closed down on July 8 (21), 1914.
p.
334 392These plans reveal the content of the article “Revolution and War” which Lenin planned to write for No.
33 of the Party’s C.
O.
, the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat.
The plans were written in July 1914 after the outbreak of war between Austria and Serbia.
The revolutionary crisis coming to a head in Russia on the eve of the war was most evident in July 1914, a period Lenin compared with January 1905, pointing to the growth of a massive revolution-ary movement, led by the illegal proletarian party, the growth of slogans providing ideological unity for the Party’s propaganda and agitation.
The revolutionary struggle was conducted under the slogans for an eight-hour working day, confiscation of landed estates and a democratic republic.
The plans show that the powerful growth of the revolutionary movement in Russia was seen by Lenin in the content of the inter-national situation, and that in his article “Revolution and War” he intended to deal with the tasks facing the proletariat of Russia in connection with the world situation.

The Congress was attended by 555 delegates.
The R.

L.
P.
C.

sent 6 delegates.
On the opening day, there was a massive anti-war demonstration and an international rally against war.
On November 25, the Congress unanimously adopted a Mani-festo on war.
It warned the nations against the threat of an impend-ing world war, exposed the plunderous aims of the war being prepared by the imperialists, urged workers in all countries to wage a resolute struggle for peace, against the threat of war, and to “confront capitalist imperialism with the might of the internation-al solidarity of the proletariat”.
In the event of an imperialist war, the Manifesto advised socialists to use the economic and political crisis caused by the war to struggle for a socialist revolution.
The leaders of the Second International (Kautsky, Vandervelde and others) voted for the Manifesto, but with the outbreak of the world war they forgot all about the Basle Manifesto and the other decisions of international socialist congresses on the struggle against war, and sided with their imperialist governments.

In the conditions of wartime and in view of the great scarcity of funds and literary forces, the need for closer contacts between Bolsheviks and joint discussion of important questions, Lenin considered it inappropriate to publish small local papers, and motioned an amendment to point 3 of the draft resolution on the question, which was put up for debate at the conference.

346 444The International Socialist Women’s Conference was held at Berne from March 26 to 28, 1915.
It was called on the initiative of the magazine Rabotnitsa’s organisation abroad with the close partici-pation of Clara Zetkin, who was at the time Chairman of the Interna-tional Socialist Women’s Bureau.
All the preparatory work for the conference was carried out by I.

Most of the delegates to the conference were under the influence of the Centrists, which is why instead of discussing general socialist tasks in connection with the war, the conference confined its work to discussing Clara Zetkin’s report “On Socialist Women’s International Action for Peace”.

Inessa Armand spoke for the draft at the conference, which however adopted the resolution drawn up by Clara Zetkin.
Lenin assessed the conference as an attempt to restore interna-tional ties and tried to use it for the purpose of rallying the inter-nationalist elements on a revolutionary platform.
But, as he pointed out later, this and other conferences of internationalists held at the time, while being inspired by the best intentions, did not lay down a militant internationalist line.

346 445 The First International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald (Swit-zerland) was held from September 5 to 8, 1915.
It was attended by 38 delegates from 11 European countries.
Most delegates took a Centrist stand.
It discussed the following questions: 1) reports by representatives of the various countries; 2) joint declaration by representatives of Germany and France; 3) proposal by the Zimmerwald Left on the adoption of a resolu-tion of principle; 4) adoption of a manifesto; 5) elections to the International Socialist Committee; 6) adoption of a resolution voicing sympathy for the victims of the war and the persecuted.
Lenin took an active part in the work of the Conference: he made speeches, sent notes to delegates during the sittings and spoke to them during the recesses.
Before the Conference, he carried out extensive preparatory work in rallying the Left wing against the social-chauvinists and the Centrists.
On the eve of the Zimmer-wald Conference, between September 2 and 4, there was a meeting of Russian and Polish delegates to discuss a “Draft Resolution Proposed by the Left Wing at Zimmerwald” which was written by Lenin, and a draft resolution motioned by Karl Radek which Lenin had criticised before the meeting.
After the discussion it was decided to motion at the Zimmerwald Conference Radek’s draft corrected on the basis of Lenin’s remarks.
The draft resolu-tion and the draft manifesto written by Lenin condemned social-chauvinism and Centrism, raised the question of rejecting the slogans: “defend your country” in the imperialist war and a “civil peace”, and pointed to the need for the propaganda of revolu-tionary action.
A majority at the Conference rejected the draft resolution on the war and the tasks of Social-Democrats and the draft manifesto motioned by the Left wing.
However, the appeal “To the Proletar-ians of Europe” adopted by the Conference contained, thanks to Lenin’s insistence, a number of basic propositions of revolu-tionary Marxism.
Lenin’s “Draft Resolution Proposed by the Left Wing at Zim-merwald”, his articles “The First Step” and “Revolutionary Marx-ists at the International Socialist Conference of September 5-8, 1915”, in which Lenin assesses the Zimmerwald Conference, are published in Vol.

The main question was the composition of the forthcoming First International Socialist Conference.

But the Kautskian majority at the conference rejected the proposal.
The preliminary conference adopted a decision to call the second Vorkonferenz which was to take the final decision on the conference.
But it was not held, the Zimmerwald Conference being convened instead.

351 448In the discussion of the draft manifesto and the draft resolution on the war and the tasks of Social-Democrats, motioned on behalf of the Zimmerwald Left by Karl Radek, a sharp struggle flared up at the Conference between the revolutionary internationalists led by Lenin and the Kautskian majority led by the German Social-Democrat G.
Ledebour.
Opposing these documents, Ledebour and the Swiss Social-Democrat R.
Grimm declared that, in putting forward concrete demands for revolutionary action, the draft manifesto and resolution motioned by the Left gave away the tactical measures of revolutionary Social-Democracy to the enemy.
They said that people who signed these documents and spread their ideas in the belligerent countries could be subjected to reprisals.

354 451A reference to Karl Liebknecht’s letter of September 2, 1915, to the International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald.
He could not take part in the Conference, because he had been drafted into the German army in early 1915.
In his letter he opposed “civil peace” and called for a civil war against the bourgeoisie, for the international solidarity of socialists of all the belligerent countries, for a struggle against the imperialist war and a break with the p.

452In his speech, the Italian Socialist Party delegate G.

In 1926, it was closed down by Mussolini’s fascist government, but continued irregular publications abroad; resumed publication in Italy in 1943.

The Labour Leader—a weekly published since 1891.
From 1893, organ of the Independent Labour Party of Britain.
From 1922, it was published under the name of New Leader; and since 1946, p.
359 carries the name of Socialist Leader.
459The Labour Party of Britain was founded in 1900 as an association of trade unions, socialist organisations and groups to seat labour representatives in Parliament (the Labour Representation Com-mittee).
In 1906, the Committee took the name of Labour Party.
Trade union members are automatically members of the Labour Party provided they pay party dues.
The Labour Party is headed by an Executive Committee which together with the General Trades Union Council and the Executive of the Co-operative Party makes up the National Labour Council.
Closely allied to the Labour Party are the Co-operative Party, which is a collective member, and the Independent Labour Party.
The Labour Party, which was initially a party of workers (many members of the petty bourgeoisie joined the party later), is opportunist in ideology and tactics.
During the First World War its leaders took a social-chauvinist stand.
The Labourites have repeatedly formed governments (1924, 1929, 1945 and 1950), which conducted the policy of British impe-rialism.
The dissatisfaction of the British working people with the reactionary policy of the Labour Party leadership has resulted in the formation of a Left-wing trend in the party aimed against the official policy of its leadership.

358 460Forward—a newspaper published in Glasgow since 1906.
During the First World War it supported the policy of the Independent Labour Party of Britain.
It was banned by the authorities after it carried a report on the so-called 1915 “Christmas events” in Glasgow (the centre on the Clyde area and of the shop stewards’ movement), when Lloyd George, at the time Minister of Munitions, was shouted down by workers, who then staged an impressive demonstration in the heart of the city carrying anti-war and anti-government slogans.

361 471Lenin is comparing the voting against the war credits by the 20 Social-Democratic deputies of the German Reichstag on Decem-ber 21, 1915, and the voting on March 20, 1915, when only two (Karl Liebknecht and Otto Rühle) voted against the war credits.
The voting of 20 deputies against the war credits testified to grow-ing pressure from the masses on the leadership of the Social-Democratic Party of Germany and its Reichstag group.
However, the majority of the C.
C.
(Vorstand) and of the Reichstag group censured the December 21 vote as a breach of party discipline.
Speaking of the inconsistency of the 20, Lenin is referring to a statement made by F.
Geyer on behalf of the members of the Social-Democratic group who had voted against the war credits on December 21, which gave no characteristic of the war as impe-rialist, made no mention of proletarian internationalism, and assumed that German plans of conquest were of a very recent development.

The editors of Vorwärts said in the editorial that although the article was being published verbatim, they believedthat the controversial questions raised in it were not only prema-ture, but altogether irrelevant.
p.
362 474A reference to the May Day demonstration and a strike by the young workers of Brunswick in early May 1916.
The strike was staged in protest against the government’s deduction of part of the young workers’ wages for a war loan.
More than 1,500 men took part in the strike and the demonstration.
Following a stubborn struggle, the government was forced to rescind its order on deduc-tions on May 5, 1916.

Hyndman and his supporters from the annual conference of the British Socialist Party held at Salford on April 23 and 24, 1916.
The conference marked the break-away of the British Socialist Party from the social-chauvin-ists.
The conference adopted a number of anti-war resolutions of a general democratic character and a resolution urging the use of the party’s full influence to put an end to the war.
By an over-whelming majority, the conference adopted a resolution saying that the socialists recognise only a class war.
In early June 1916, Hyndman set up the National Socialist Party which in 1918 took p.

Bukharin was also on the Editorial Board.
One (double) issue was published.
It carried, apart from the article “The Voice of an Honest French Socialist”, two other articles by Lenin: “The Collapse of the Second International” and “Imperialism and Socialism in Italy”.
The plan for the publication of the journal was worked out by Lenin in the spring of 1915.
He directed the organisational meeting of the Editorial Board.
Lenin hoped to make it an international organ of Left-wing Social-Democrats.
However, there soon appeared serious differences between the Editorial Board and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh, which were aggravated after the issue of No.
1-2.
The Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosh group took an incorrect attitude on many basic questions of the Programme and tactics of the Party—the right of nations to self-determination, the role of democratic demands and the minimum programme in general, etc.
—and tried to use the journal for their factional aims.
On the Editorial Board, Lenin conducted a struggle against the Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosh group, exposing their anti-Bolshevik views and factionaI acts, and sharply criticising the conciliatory attitude of G.
Y.
Zinoviev and A.
G.
Shlyapnikov towards the group.
In view of the anti-Party behaviour of this group, the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat, on Lenin’s proposal, declared that it considered the further publication of the journal impossible.
The C.
C.
Bureau in Russia, having heard a report on the differences on the Kommunist Editorial Board, declared its full solidarity with the Editorial Board of the Central Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, and expressed the wish that “all C.

publications should be edited in a strictly consistent tenor, in full conformity with the line of the C.

368 491The Second International Socialist Conference was held at Kienthal, Switzerland, from April 24 to 30, 1916.
It was attended by 43 dele-gates from 10 countries and discussed the following questions: 1) the struggle to end the war; 2) attitude of the proletariat to questions of peace; 3) agitation and propaganda; 4) parliamentary activity; 5) mass struggle, and 6) convocation of the International Socialist Bureau.
As a result of the work done by Lenin and the Bolsheviks before the Conference, the Left wing at the Conference was stronger than at Zimmerwald.
The Zimmerwald Left worked out and motioned at the Conference a draft resolution on peace, which contained Lenin’s basic propositions.
Although the Kienthal Conference failed to adopt the Bolshevik slogans—to transform the imperial-ist war into a civil war, to work for the defeat in the war of one’s own imperialist government and to set up the Third Internation-al—it nevertheless helped to bring out and rally the internation-alist elements.
Lenin said the Kienthal Conference was a step forward.
Lenin wrote: “Draft Resolution on the Convocation of the Second Socialist Conference”, “For the Conference To Be Held on April 24, 1916.
Proposal of the Delegation” and “Proposals Submitted by the Central Committee of the R.

1 of September 21, 1915, said: “This secretariat should in no sense substitute for the now existing International Socialist Bureau, and should be dissolved as soon as the latter can fully answer its purpose.
” On a copy of the report, now at the Central Party Archives, Lenin underlined these words and wrote in the margin: “Kein Beschluss darüber” (There was no decision about this), that is, the decision was adopted not by the Zimmerwald association, but after the Conference.

369 493The London conference of the socialists of the Triple Entente countries was held on February 14, 1915.
It was attended by representatives of the social-chauvinists and pacifist groups of Britain, France, Belgium and Russia: the Independent Labour Party, the British Socialist Party, the Labour Party, the Fabian Society, the French Socialist Party, the General Confederation of Labour, the Belgian Socialist Party, the S.
R.
s and the Mensheviks.
On its agenda were these questions: 1) the rights of nations; 2) colonies; 3) guarantees for a future peace.
The Bolsheviks were not invited to the conference.
However on Lenin’s instructions, M.
M.
Litvinov went to the conference to read out a declaration of the R.

Central Committee.
It was based on a draft written by Lenin.
The declaration contained a demand for the withdrawal of the socialists from the bourgeois governments, a complete break with the imperialists a repudiation of collaboration with them, resolute struggle against the imperial-ist governments and condemnation of the voting of war credits.
As he was reading out the declaration, Litvinov was interrupted and not allowed to continue.
He handed in the text of the declara-tion to the presidium and left the conference.

380 500This was a protest against the oppressive policy of the tsarist autocracy, and the German and the Austrian governments, who, “depriving the Polish people of the possibility of deciding its own future, regard the Polish regions as a pledge in the forthcoming game of compensations.
.
.
.
” “ This is an especially gross expression of the essence of the policy of the capitalist governments, who, while sending masses of people into the slaughter, arbitrarily determine the future of the peoples for whole generations.
” The Polish Social-Democrats expressed the conviction that only the participation in the imminent struggle of the revolutionary international proletariat for socialism, “a struggle that would break the chains of national oppression and abolish all forms of alien domination, will assure the Polish people as well the possibi-lity of an all-round development as an equal member of the union of nations”.
The document published here was written by Lenin on a separate sheet and is apparently a variant of the corresponding passage from his article “The Discussion on Self-Determination Summed Up” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
348).
p.
380 501The plan was drawn up not earlier than November 18 (December 1), 1916, when Lenin was working on the material concerning the Marxist attitude to the state.
The sheet containing the plan was inserted in the notebook “Marxism on the State ” .
That Lenin intended to write a work on the state is evident from his note “The Youth International” published in December 1916.
Analysing and criticising N.
I.
Bukharin’s article “The Imperialist Predatory State”, Lenin wrote: “We hope to return to this very important subject in a separate article” (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
166).
A comparison of the present plan with Bukharin’s articles “Con-cerning the Theory of the Imperialist State” and “The Imperialist Predatory State” shows that this is precisely the plan for an article aimed against Bukharin’s anti-Marxist, semi-anarchist views of the state.
In a letter to A.
M.
Kollontai on February 4 (17), 1917, Lenin wrote: “I am preparing (have got the material ready) an article on the question of the attitude of Marxism to the state” (see present edition, Vol.
35, p.
286).
The article was intended for No.
4 of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, but was apparently not written.
The material collected by Lenin for the article made up his notebook, “Marxism on the State” (see Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works, Vol.
33, pp.
123-307) and was used by Lenin in his book The State and Revolution (see present edition, Vol.

382 505The Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland (in French and Italian cantons the party is called the Swiss Socialist Party) was set up in the 1870s and was a member of the First International.
It was re-established in 1888.
Strong influence in the party was enjoyed by the opportunists, who in the First World War took a social-chauvinist stand.
In the autumn of 1916, the Right wing split away from the Party and set up its own organisation.
The party majority headed by B.
Grimm took a Centrist, social-pacifiststand.
The Left wing of the party took an internationalist stand.
Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the Left wing of the party gained in strength.
In Decem-ber 1920, the Left withdrew from the party and in 1921 united with the Communist Party of Switzerland (now the Swiss Party of Labour), which was formed in 1919.

382 506 The Spartacus group—a revolutionary organisation of German Left-wing Social-Democrats, formed at the beginning of the First World War by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, J.
Marchlewski, L.
Jogiches (Tyszka) and W.
Pieck.
In April 1915 Rosa Luxemburg and Franz Mehring founded the magazine Die Internationale, which rallied the main forces of Ger-man Left-wing Social-Democrats.
On January 1, 1916, an All-German Conference of Left-wing Social-Democrats was held in Ber-lin where the group was formalised and decided to call itself the Internationale group.
As its platform, the conference adopted “Leitsätze” (Basic Propositions) worked out by Rosa Luxemburg with the participation of Karl Liebknecht, Franz Mehring and Clara Zetkin.
In 1916, the Internationale group, apart from political leaflets which it published from 1915, began illegal publication and circulation of “Political Letters” signed Spartacus (published regularly until October 1918); then it also began to call itself the Spartacus group.
The Spartacists conducted revolutionary propaganda in the masses, organised mass anti-war manifestations, directed strikes and exposed the imperialist character of the world war and the betrayal of the opportunist Social-Democratic leaders.
However they made serious mistakes in theory and policy: they denied the possibility of national liberation wars in the epoch of imperialism failed to take a consistent stand on the slogan of transforming the imperialist war into a civil war, underestimated the role of the proletarian party as the vanguard of the working class and feared a resolute break with the opportunists.
In April 1917, the group joined the Centrist Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, retaining its organisational inde-pendence.
In November 1918, during the revolution in Ger-many, the Spartacus group broke away from the “Independ-ents” and set up the Spartacus Union, publishing its own pro-gramme on December 14, 1918.
At their inaugural congress (Decem-ber 30, 1918-January 1, 1919) they set up the Communist Party of Germany.
Lenin repeatedly criticised the mistakes of the German Left-wing Social-Democrats and pointed to the inconsistency of their stand.
At the same time, he put a high value on their revolu-tionary activity.
He wrote: “The work of the German Spartacus group, which has carried on systematic revolutionary propaganda in the most difficult conditions, has really saved the honour of German socialism and the German proletariat” (see present edi-tion, Vol.
35, p.

517This deals with the question of reworking the Party Programme.
Lenin first intended to devote the fourth and then the fifth letter to this subject.
But both the fourth and the unfinished fifth letter deal with other subjects.
The manuscript of the plan included in this volume shows that Lenin subsequently added new points to it (2 bis, 5 bis and points marked with a &).
The plan became the basis for his work on the Party Programme upon his arrival in Russia (see present edition, Vol.

C.
Lindhagen spoke on the subject of “Light from the East”; Lenin gave a short report on the trip; a protocol on the circumstances of the trip across Germany was read out, after which the Swedish Social-Democrats expressed their readiness to testify their full solidarity with the step of the Russian revolutionaries.
On behalf of the Swedes the conference was also addressed by C.
N.
Carleson, who expressed the hope that the revolution in Russia would grow into an international one.
In conclusion, the Swedes gave an enthusiastic reception to the Russians and the organiser of the trip, Fritz Platten.
p.
398 527The Bolshevik group of the Soviet discussed the attitude to the “liberty loan” for two days, April 10 and 11 (23 and 24), 1917.
The draft resolution for the Plenary Meeting of the Soviet was worked out with Lenin’s active participation.
A resolution refusing support for the loan was motioned by the committee headed by A.
M.
Kol-lontai, after which Lenin and Zinoviev proposed a second resolu-tion supplementing the first.
The two resolutions were consolidated and were adopted unanimously on April 11 (24).
The report of the group’s sitting was published in Pravda No.
31 of April 13 (26).
In his report on the present situation at the April Conference, Lenin said that the question of war “actually united us when we came out against the loan” (present edition, Vol.
24, p.
232).
At the Soviet’s Plenary Meeting, 2,000 deputies voted for the loan and 123 against.

Petersburg Committee of April 6 (19) and was held from April 14 to 22 (April 27-May 5), 1917.
It was attend-ed by 57 delegates, including delegates from the Finnish, Estonian, Latvian, Polish and Lithuanian organisations, representatives of the Military Organisation, and also two mezhraiontsi (see Note 556).
On the agenda were the following questions: current p.
398tasks—present situation; attitude to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and the question of its reorganisation; struc-ture of Party organisation; attitude to the other Social-Democratic trends; municipal elections; harassment of Pravda.
Lenin was elected honorary Chairman of the Conference.
He gave the main political report on “Current Tasks—Present Situation”, and was on the committee to work out the resolutions: “On the Attitude Towards the Provisional Government” and “On the War”; he motioned the resolutions “On the Municipal Elections” and “On the Attitude Towards the Parties of Socialist-Revolutionaries, Menshevik Social-Democrats, ‘non-factional’ Social-Democrats and other kindred political trends”.
Kamenev’s attempt in his speech and amendments to Lenin’s resolution on the attitude to the Provisional Government to put through the demand of control over it, was exposed by Lenin as conciliatory, as the policy of Chkheidze and Steklov.
By an overwhelming majority, the Conference adopted Lenin’s resolution on the attitude to the Provisional Government.
At the first sitting it adopted Lenin’s appeal “Against the Riot-mongers.
To the Workers, Soldiers and the Whole Population of Petrograd.
” On April 10 (May 2) the sittings were interrupted in view of the massive protest movement in response to the Provisional Govern-ment’s note to the allied powers on April 18 (May 1) expressing its readiness to continue the imperialist war.
The Conference decided to urge the workers and soldiers to give organised expres-sion to their solidarity with the basic propositions of the Party Central Committee resolution of April 20 (May 3) on the crisis in connection with the said note of the Provisional Government (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
184-85).
The delegates took part in explanatory work carried on by the Central Committee in the masses.
In view of this, subsequent sittings were not fully attended.
The decisions of the Petrograd City Conference testified to the cohesion of the Petrograd Bolsheviks round Lenin’s “April Theses”; Lenin’s tactics were given approval by the Party organisation of the capital, the largest in the country.
The resolutions of the Petrograd Conference largely formed the basis of the resolutions of the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.

529 Izvestia Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh Deputatov (Bulletin of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Depu-ties)—a daily; the first issue appeared on February 28 (March 13), 1917, under the title Izvestia Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh Deputatov (Bulletin of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ Deputies); from No.
3 of March 2 (15) the paper became the organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
With the formation, at the First All-Russia Congress of Soviets, of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the paper became its organ and from August 1 (14) (No.
132) was published under the name Izvestia Tsentralnogo Ispolnitelnogo Komiteta i Petrogradskogo Sovieta Rabochikh i Soldatskikh Deputatov (Bulletin of the Central Execu-tive Committee and of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies).
The paper’s political line was determined by the representatives of the S.
R.
-Menshevik bloc who conducted the conciliatory policy of supporting the bourgeois Provisional Govern-ment and who opposed the revolutionary action of the proletariat.
After the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, its Editorial Board was changed and the newspaper became the official organ of the Soviet Government.
It carried the first important documents of the Soviet Government and Lenin’s articles and speeches.
In March 1918, its publication was transferred to Moscow.
After the formation of the U.
S.
S.
R.
in December 1922, the paper became the organ of the Central Executive Committee of the U.
S.

and the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.
Under a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.
S.
S.

on January 24, 1938, the paper was reorganised and since January 26, 1938, until the present day it has been published under the name of Izvestia Sovietov Deputatov Trudyashchikhsya (Bulletin of the Soviets of Working People’s Deputies).

531Arriving at a meeting of the soldiers’ section of the Soviet of Work-ers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on April 17 (30), Lenin requested the floor to make an urgent statement over the publication in the newspapers on April 16 (29) of the resolution of the Executive Commission of the soldiers’ section which condemned the “prop-aganda of the Leninists” as being just as harmful as “any other counter-revolutionary propaganda from the right” (see present edition, Vol.
24, p.
172).
As he was speaking the Menshevik-S.
R.
majority, against the protests of the minority, got his time limited to 30 minutes.
When Lenin finished speaking, he replied to questions from the meeting and then to those of the soldiers who surrounded him in a room at the exit of the Taurida Palace.
After Lenin’s speech and objections to it from the Menshevik Lieber, the soldiers’ section decided to proceed with its business, without making any statement on the substance of the question.
Lenin’s speech was published in a distorted version in Rech and Yedinstvo.
It is here published in accordance with the minutes now at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

P.
(B.

S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) Central Committee, taken between April 4 and 8 (17 and 21), and was held in Petrograd from April 24 to 29 (May 7-12), 1917.
It was the Party’s first conference in legal conditions.
It was attended by 131 delegates with vote and 18 with voice from 78 Party organisations (including Petrograd and its environments, Moscow and Moscow District, the Central Industrial Area, the Urals, the Donbas, the Volga area and the Caucasus) and also by representatives of front and rear military organisations, the national organisations of Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland and Estonia.
On the strength of its representation and the political and organisational tasks it dealt with, the Conference could perform and did perform the work of a Party congress: it worked out the political line for the whole Party and set up the Party governing centres.
At 2 p.
m.
on the day before it opened, there was a meeting of more than a hundred delegates at which new items were added to the agenda and the standing orders of the Conference were approved.
A report on the April 21-22 events was given by Lenin who was met with warm applause.
On the agenda of the Conference were the following questions: the current situation (the war and the Provisional Government, etc.
), a peace conference, attitude to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, revision of the Party Programme, the situation within the International and the Party’s tasks; unification of the internationalist Social-Democratic organisations, agrarian question, national question, Constituent Assembly, organisational question, reports by regions and elec-tions to the Central Committee.
Lenin opened the Conference with a brief speech of welcome and was elected to the presidium.
He directed all the work of the Con-ference.
The Conference exposed and rejected the Right-wing capitulatory line of L.
B.
Kamenev, who gave a co-report on the present situa-tion as the representative of an anti-Leninist group.
L.
B.
Kame-nev and A.
I.
Rykov tried to oppose the Leninist line towards the socialist revolution by the opportunist assessment of the 1917 revolution and the prospects of its development.
Denying the possibility and need for the bourgeois-democratic revolution to develop into a socialist revolution, Kamenev proposed that the benefit of Empress p.
408Conference should confine itself to accepting control over the bourgeois Provisional Government on the part of the Menshevik-S.
R.
Soviets.
The Conference rejected the capitulatory stand of Kamenev and his small group of supporters, who denied the possi-bility of the victory of socialism in Russia.
In his report on the revision of the Party Programme, Lenin determined the direction in which the Programme Committee set up by the Conference was to rewrite the Programme of 1903.
During the debate on the national question, G.
L.
Pyatakov spoke against Lenin’s slogan of the right of nations to self-deter-mination including secession and the formation of an independent state.
In support of his resolution on the national question, Lenin said that this right alone ensured complete solidarity of workers and all working people of different nationalities, while the expe-diency of secession was to be decided by the proletarian party “in each particular case, having regard to the interests of social development as a whole and the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat for socialism” (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
302-03).
Lenin’s thesis on the break with the Zimmerwald Centrist majority and the establishment of the Third, Communist Interna-tional was opposed by G.
Y.
Zinoviev.
The Conference made a mistake by voting for the Bolsheviks’ participation in the Third Zimmerwald Conference, which was predominantly Centrist in composition, thereby delaying preparations for the establish-ment of the Third, Communist International.
Life itself very soon corrected this mistake (see present edition, Vol.
24, p.
388, and the unfinished article “The Tasks of Our Party in the Interna-tional”, Vol.
26, pp.
220-22).
The Conference elected the Central Committee headed by Lenin.
The historic importance of the Seventh (April) Conference lay in the fact that it adopted Lenin’s programme for transition to the second stage of the revolution in Russia, mapped out the struggle for the development of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution and put forward the demand for the transfer of all power to the Soviets.
Under this slogan, the Bolsheviks prepared the masses for the proletarian revolution.
p.
409 537 The question of calling an international conference of socialists from the belligerent and neutral countries was repeatedly discussed by the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet in April 1917, the Executive Committee proposing to take the initiative in convening such a conference.
In the second half of April, the Danish Social-Democrat Borgbjerg, who was connected with the social-chauvinists of Germany, came to Petrograd and on behalf of the United Committee of the Labour Parties of Denmark, Nor-way and Sweden (the social-patriotic majority of these parties) proposed that the socialist parties of Russia should take part in a peace conference to be called at Stockholm in May 1917.
On April 23 (May 6), Borgbjerg gave a report at a sitting of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, frankly declaringthat the German Government would agree to the peace terms the German Social-Democrats would put forward at the socialist conference.
On April 25 (May 8), the Executive Committee heard statements by the Party groups on this question.
The Bolsheviks read out the resolution of the April Conference adopted that day, “On Borgbjerg’s Proposal”; they were joined by representatives of the Polish and the Latvian Social-Democrats.
Lenin believed that participation in the proposed conference would be a complete betrayal of internationalism.
The April Conference came out resolutely against participation, exposing Borgbjerg as an agent of German imperialism.
The Trudoviks, Bundists and Mensheviks favoured participation.
The Executive Committee adopted a Men-shevik resolution declaring that it took upon itself the initiative in calling the conference and was setting up a special commission for the purpose.
This decision was confirmed by the Plenary Meet-ing of the Soviet.
British, French and Belgian socialists of the majority refused to participate in the conference, for the British and the French governments wanted to defeat Germany.
The Centrists agreed to take part: the group of J.
Longuet from France, and the Inde-pendent Social-Democratic Party, with K.
Kautsky, H.
Haase and G.
Ledebour at the head, from Germany.
The Spartacus group, which had affiliated to the party of “Inde-pendents” while retaining its organisational independence, refused to take part in the conference with the social-imperialists.
Franz Mehring made a statement about this on his own behalf and on behalf of K.
Liebknecht and R.
Luxemburg who were in prison.
The conference did not take place because some of the delegates were not issued passports by their governments, and others refused to meet with representatives of the countries in a state of war with their own.

Four issues appeared in May and June 1914.
From March to November 1917, It was published daily.
Starting from December 1917 to January 1918, it appeared under the name of Nashe Yedinstvo.
It gave support to the Provisional Govern-ment, favoured the coalition with the bourgeoisie and “firm power”, and fought against the Bolsheviks, frequently resorting to the methods of the gutter press.
Lenin noted that its line was “aiding and abetting the dark forces which threaten violence, bombs,and riots” and called the paper an “abusive publication” (see pres-ent edition, Vol.
24, pp.
129, 199).
It gave a hostile reception to the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet power.

A.
—Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Mini-ster for the Interior in tsarist Russia from 1906 to 1911.

425 542The Agrarian Programme of the 104—the agrarian bill signed by 104 members of the First Duma and tabled by the Trudoviks at the thirteenth sitting on May 23 (June 5), 1906.
The bill said the aim of agrarian legislation was “to strive to establish an order under which all land with its minerals and waters would belong to the whole people, with the land required for agriculture being given for use only to those who would cultivate it by their labour” (Gosudarstvennaya duma v Rossii v dokumentakh i materialakh [The State Duma in Russia in Documents and Materials], Moscow, 1957, p.
172).
The Trudoviks demanded the establishment of a “nation-wide land fund” which was to include all the state, crown, cabinet, monastery and church lands; there was also to be a forcible alienation into the fund of landed estates and other privately owned lands where the size of possessions was in excess of the labour norm established for the given area.
Some compensa-tion was to be paid for the alienated privately owned lands.
Allot-ments and small privately owned tracts were to be retained by their owners for some time; the bill provided for a subsequent gradual transfer of these lands as well to the nation-wide fund.
The agrarian reform was to be carried out by local committees elected by universal, direct and equal suffrage with secret ballot.

It was dated April 24 (May 7), 1917, that is, the period when the bourgeois and after it the petty-bourgeois pressstarted a slander campaign against Lenin and the other members of the Bolshevik Party who had returned to Russia from Switzer-land via Germany.
The soldiers’ letter said: “In view of the fact that there is much friction over Lenin among the soldiers of the battery, please let us have the earliest possible reply.
What is his origin? Where had he been? If he had been exiled, what for? How did he return to Russia and what is he doing at present, that is, are his acts doing us good or harm? In short, we should like to be convinced by your letter, so as to stop our arguments, lose no more time and be able to prove our point to other comrades as well” (Pravda No.
86 of April 16, 1927).
The letter was passed on to Lenin.

Lunacharsky, who spoke before Lenin, proposed an ultima-tum to the governments of France and Britain to make them accept the formula of peace without annexations and indemnities, and the announcing of a ceasefire on all fronts.
At the same time, said Lu-nacharsky, we must appeal to the peoples of the Allied countries and also of Germany and Austria, urging them to exert pressure on their governments with all means at their disposal.
If the Ger-man Government should insist on continuing the war under this unconditional formula, the falsity of its assertion that it was waging a defensive war would be exposed.

It was started by a group of Menshevik internationalists and writers connected with the journal Letopis.
Characterising this group, Lenin said that “intel-lectual scepticism, which conceals and expresses lack of principle, is the dominant mood” in their midst (see present edition, Vol.
25, pp.
274-75) , and ironically called them “ would-be internationalists” and “pseudo-Marxists ”.
The newspaper took a hostile attitude to the Socialist Revolution in October 1917 and the establishment of the Soviet power.
From June 1, 1918, it had two editions: one in Petrograd, another in Moscow.
Both were closed down in July 1918.

The All-Russia Conference of Front and Rear Military Organi-sations of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) was held in Petrograd from June 16 to 23 (June 29 to July 6), 1917.
It was attended by 107 delegates from 43 front and 17 rear military Bolshevik organisations uniting almost 26,000 members of the Party.
It was called by the Organ-ising Bureau of the Central Committee Military Organisation.
On its agenda were these questions: reports from the localities; attitude to the resolutions of the Seventh (April) Conference; the present situation; organisation of power and the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies; the war, the peace and the offen-sive; the agrarian question and others.
Lenin gave reports on the present situation and on the agrarian question.
The conference recognised the need to replace the standing army by armed workers’ battalions of the Red Guard placed at the disposal of the elected workers’ organi-sations, and to replace the police by the people’s militia (see K.
P.
S.
S.
v rezolutsiyakh .

The confer-ence decided to regard the newspaper Soldatskaya Pravda as the Central Organ of the military organisations of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
), approved the draft Rules for the Military Organisation and elected the All-Russia Central Bureau of Military Organisations consisting of M.
S.
Kedrov, N.
V.
Krylenko, V.
I.
Nevsky, N.
I.
Podvoisky and others.
The conference was of great importance in strengthening the ties between the proletariat and the soldier mass and helped to extend the work of the Bolsheviks among the soldiers.
p.
439 551The theses were written by Lenin on July 10 (23), 1917, and defined the new tactical line of the Bolshevik Party in connection withthe changed political situation following the fusillade of the workers’ and soldiers’ demonstration on July 4 (17) and the transfer of all power into the hands of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government.
The theses were discussed at an Enlarged Conference of the Central Committee of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) together with representatives of the St.
Petersburg Committee, the Military Organisation of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) Central Committee, the Moscow Regional Bureau, the Moscow Committee and the Moscow District Committee, held on July 13 and 14 (26-27), 1917.
The theses were published in the form of an article under the title “Political Mood” on August 2 (July 20), 1917, in the newspaper Proletarskoye Dyelo.
It was the organ of the Bolshevik group of the Kronstadt Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and was published in place of the Bolshevik newspaper Golos Pravdy, closed down in July by the Provisional Government.
When the manuscript was being prepared for the press, the subtitle “Four Theses” and points 1, 2, 3, 4, the words “in the thesis” and also the end of the article (beginning with the words “Form illegal organisations.
.
.
) were deleted; the words “armed uprising” were replaced by the words “resolute struggle”.
The manuscript heading also contained the word “latest” in front of the words “Political Situation”, which was also crossed out, but there is no certainty that it was done in connection with the publication of the document in the legal press since in that case the word “situation” would have been replaced by the word “mood”.
It should also be borne in mind that Lenin himself later mentioned in his “Aide memoire” (see Fifth Russian edition of the Col-lected Works, Vol.
34, pp.
443-44) his theses on “the political situation” (and not “the latest political situation”).
Finally, this document, since its first publication as belonging to Lenin (1925), has gone down in the Party history and is known to everyone precisely as “The Political Situation”.
Accordingly, the word “ latest ” has not been restored in Vol.
34 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works.
p.
440 552 Full power passed into the hands of the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government after the events of July 3-5, which were an expression of the most profound political crisis gripping the country.
The failure of the Russian offensive at the front started by Kerensky on June 18 (31), the fresh sacrifices made for the benefit of the imperialists, the growth of unemployment in view of the closure of enterprises by the capitalists, the growing cost of living and the acute shortage of the foodstuffs caused an explo-sion of indignation among the broad masses of workers and soldiers over the counter-revolutionary policy of the Provisional Govern-ment.
On July 3 (16) spontaneous demonstrations developed and threatened to grow into an armed uprising against the Provisional Government.
At the moment, the Bolshevik Party was against any armed action, for it believed that the revolutionary crisis had not yet matured, and that the army and the provinces were not yet readyto support the uprising in the capital.

S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) Central Committee, decided to refrain from taking any action.
A similar decision was also taken by the Second Petrograd City Conference of the Bolsheviks then in session.
The delegates went to the districts to restrain the masses from taking action.
But it had already begun and it proved impossible to stop it.
In view of the mood of the masses, the Central Committee, together with the St.
Petersburg Committee and the Military Organisation, late at night on July 3 (16), decided to participate in the demonstration on July 4 (17) so as to lend it a peaceful and organised character.
At the time, Lenin was away: he was ill due to overwork and had gone to the countryside for a few days’ rest.
When he was informed of the events, he returned to Petrograd on the morning of July 4 (17) and took over direction of the events.
More than 500,000 took part in the demonstration on July 4 (17).
It was stared under Bolshevik slogans: “All power to the Soviets!” and others.
The demonstrators nominated 90 represent-atives, who handed to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets a demand for the transfer of all the power to the Soviets.
However, the S.
R.
and Menshevik leaders refused to take over.
With the knowledge and consent of the Menshevik-S.
R.
Central Executive Committee, the Provisional Government decided to suppress the demonstration by armed force.
Military cadet and counter-revolutionary Cossack regiments were thrown against the peaceable demonstration of workers and soldiers.
They opened fire on the demonstrators.
Reactionary-minded military units were summoned from the front.
The conference of members of the C.
C.
and the St.
Petersburg Committee, held under Lenin’s direction on the night of July 4 (17), decided to stop the demonstration in an organised manner.
This was a correct step taken by the Party, which succeeded in retreating at a right time and preserving the main forces of the revolution from being routed.
After the dispersal of the demonstration, the bourgeois Provi-sional Government continued its reprisals.
It attacked the Bol-shevik Party with special ferocity.
The Bolshevik newspapers Pravda, Soldatskaya Pravda and others were closed down.
Work-ers were disarmed, and arrests, searches and pogroms followed.
The revolutionary units of the Petrograd garrison which had taken part in the demonstration were disbanded and sent to the front.
The Mensheviks and S.
R.
s were accomplices of the counter-revo-lutionary butchers.

The leaflet was not published.

p.
443 554The theses were first published in full in Vol.
34 of the Fifth Russian edition of the Collected Works.
The First edition of theCollected Works (Vol.
14, Part II), and the Fourth edition of the Collected Works (Vol.
26), did not contain the section “On the List of Candidates for the Constituent Assembly” and the note to it.
In Vol.
21 of the Second and Third editions of the Collected Works it was published in part.
The Third Petrograd City Conference was held from October 7 to 11 (20 to 24), 1917.
It was attended by 92 delegates with vote and 40 delegates with voice only.
Lenin was elected honorary chairman.
Lenin’s theses were the basis of the Conference deci-sions.
In a resolution on the present situation, the Conference declared the need to replace the Kerensky government by a workers’ and peasants’ revolutionary government, for only such a govern-ment could give land to the peasants and take the country out of the war and the ruin.
The Conference adopted resolutions “On the Red Guard” and “On the Hunger Strike by Political Prison-ers in the Case of July 3 (16)-5 (18)”.
Its decisions emphasised that the country was on the eve of a massive proletarian uprising and expressed the firm conviction that the uprising would be victorious.
The Conference discussed the question of elections to the Constituent Assembly, Lenin being among the first candi-dates nominated from Petrograd.
The sitting on October 11 (24) heard Lenin’s “Letter to the Petrograd City Conference” (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
145-48).
The Conference played a very important part in the preparation of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
p.
446 555The Provisional Government announced the convocation of the Constituent Assembly in its Declaration of March 2 (15), 1917.
On June 14 (27), the Provisional Government adopted a decision appointing the elections to the Constituent Assembly on Sep-tember 17 (30).
But in August it postponed the elections until November 12 (25).
The elections were held after the victory of the October Social-ist Revolution, on the appointed day.
Polling took place by lists drawn up before the October Revolution and under the statute approved by the Provisional Government.
A considerable section of the people had not yet had time to grasp the full significance of the socialist revolution, which was used by the Right-wing S.
R.
s, who managed to win majorities in gubernias and regions, far away from the capital and industrial centres.
The Constituent Assembly was convened by the Soviet Government and opened in Petrograd on January 5 (18), 1918.
The counter-revolutionary majority of the Constituent Assembly rejected the “Declaration of the Rights of the Working and Exploited People” which was placed before it by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, and refused to recognise the Soviet power.
The bourgeois Constit-uent Assembly was dissolved by a decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on January 6 (19).

unity.
Behindthe slogan of unity, and in an effort to merge the Bolshevik and the Menshevik organisations in St.
Petersburg, the mezhraiontsi actually set up their own factional organisation, which included Trotskyite Mensheviks and also a section of former Bolsheviks who took a conciliatory attitude towards the opportunists.
During the First World War, the mezhraiontsi adopted a Centrist stand; they recognised the war as imperialist and opposed social-chauvinism, but did not agree to a full break-away from the Men-sheviks.
In 1917, the mezhraiontsi organisation, which included A.
Joffe, A.
Lunacharsky, D.
Manuilsky, L.
Trotsky, M.
Uritsky, V.
Volodarsky and I.
Yurenev, announced its agreement with the Bolshevik Party line.
At the Sixth Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) the mezhraiontsi organisation (almost 4,000 members) broke away from the Menshevik defencists and was admitted to the Bolshevik Party.
Subsequent events showed that some mezhraiontsi (includ-ing Lunacharsky, Manuilsky, Volodarsky and Uritsky) did in fact break with their Centrist past and became prominent members of the Bolshevik Party.
But Trotsky, even after he entered the Bolshevik Party, did not become a Bolshevik and carried on a secret and open struggle against Leninism and the Party’s policy.
He became the bitterest enemy of Leninism, the Soviet state and the entire international communist movement.
The mezhraiontsi published their own periodical—the journal Vperyod (one issue appeared in 1915 illegally).
Its publication was resumed in 1917: from June to August it was published legally as the organ of the St.
Petersburg Inter-District Committee of the United Social-Democrats (internationalists); there were 8 issues.
After the Sixth Party Congress, the Editorial Board was changed and No.

559 The Cossack demonstration, or the Cossack “religious procession”, in Petrograd was set for October 22 (November 4), 1917, and was regarded by the counter-revolutionaries as a show of force in their struggle against the mounting revolution.
The Bolsheviks carried on extensive agitation among the Cossacks urging them to refrain from taking part in the demonstration.
The Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies issued an appeal to the Cossacks.
Representatives of the Cossack regiments were invited to a con-ference of regimental committees held by the Petrograd Soviet in Smolny on October 21 (November 3).
At the conference, the Cossacks declared that they would not act against the workers and soldiers.
The night before the demonstration, the Provisional Government was forced to call it off.
